Mondayscasualties but the war office declaredthat nothing had been received sinceSir George Whites dispatch communicating the news of the capture of theRoyal Irish Fusiliers and the Gloucestershire regimentThe disaster has caused a feelingakin to consternation in Gloucestershire and the north of Ireland wherethe captured regiments were recruitedthe blackest ploom prevails families awaiting with beating hearts thenames of the killed and woundedwhich are fully expected to reach ahigh figure Many homes are alreadyin mourning in consequence of lossessustained by these regiments in previous engagementsPublic anxiety was increased by aspecial dispatch from Ladysmith published in the late editions of the London afternoon papers to the effect thatbefore darkness Monday the Boers reoccupied the old position held by theirheavy artillery which Gen White hadreported silenced by the guns of thenaval brigade from the Powerful andhad opened fire again The dispatchfurther saysThe enemy are again closing in andthe situation is one of grave anxietyBeyond doubt the Boer retirementMonday was a ruse to draw GenWhite into the hilly country and awayfrom the British campThis last sentence is significant andconfirms the opinion of militarj experts that Gen White is allowing himself to be outgeneraled by Commandant Gen JoubertFrom the scanty advices received upto 11 oclock p m it seems tolerablycertain that the disaster was a simplerepetition of the battle of Majuba hillthough on a larger scale The tworegiments were allowed to march intoa trap set for them It is simply acase of Boer spider and British fly In-fact -the whole engagement of Monday seems to have been brought on byCommandant Gen Joubert who skilfully conceived a gigantic trap out ofwhich as the official dispatch showsSir George White only escaped withdifficultyGen White advanced with the ideaof driving the Boers from the hillseven miles out which Gen Joubertmade n ostentatious show of fortifying on SundayThe Boer commander left a force sufficient to draw Gen Whiteon while themass of the Boers he moved stealthilyround the British right to deliver aflank attack and to endeavor to cut offGen White from Ladysmith TheBritish commander succeeded in beating off the attack but only with greatdifficulty and during the turningmovements his troops suffered from aflanking fireHarsh things are said in

statment is published that Gen Sir Redvers Buller hasleft Cape Town for LadysmitnThe queen is credited with expressing sincere pity for Sir George StewartWhite and the officials are in nowiseinclined to judge him harshly So faras the public is concerned howeverwhile gratification is felt at themanner in which the isolatedbattalions surrendered there is stillsevere criticism for Gen White andLieut Col Carleton for allowing thecolumn to get out of touch for the absence of nroper scouting and for notretiring when the ammunition waslost In favor of Lieut Col Carletonthe explanation is hazarded

and turn in 1 was calculating to sleep on board to night but Illwait for daylight before I try that tripagainThen pressing Toms hand warmlythe old miner saidGood night mate You oughter6lpip well after saving a mans life andmoney too Do you know I have 3000in my clothes and but for you itwouldnt be there nowThere was a suspicious moisture Lthis eyes as he turned hastily and leftthe room leaving Tom to his pleasantthoughtsHe could hardly realize all that hadbeen crowded into the few hours sincehis arrival and his sleep was brokenby fitful dreams in which revolversand robbers played prominent rolesCHAPTER IITOM MEETS AN OLD ENEMYWhen Tom Scott awoke the followingmorning his side was stiff and sore butby the time he had dressed and madeJiis way downstairs he had almost forgotten the wound in the realization ofthe fact that the way had been miraculously opened for him to reach the goldregionHe foiind the old miner waiting forKiim In e smokingr room and as heentered the latter arose and greeted fhim heartily sayingGood morning Scott How is theside to day Pretty sore isnt it Myheadpiece is rather tender too fromthe clip I got but theyll both havetime to heal before the voyage is overCome on lets get a good square mealand then well go down to the vesselI hope shell be ready to sail to dayAll my stuffs been on board for aweek now Youll want a few duds tooI dare say for the tripAfter a hearty meal the two men proceeded to the wharf and as theyreached the scene of the previousnights struggle the elder man saidquietlyIll never forget this place as longas I live If those rascals had onlydreamed what I carried with me theydhave finished their bloody work and Idhave been down thereAs he spoke he pointed significantlytoward the icy water in the dock andthen addedThe money was nothing butHe broke off suddenly and led theway in silence until they reached thevessel where the captain a grizzled oldsalt was pacing the deck and urgingthe stevedores to greater effortsThe Seabird was a trim built craft ofabout GOO tons The cook was fljingabout the deck in his white apron thesecond mate was hard at work belowand as the two men stepped on boardXhf captain said cheerilyGood morning Mr Avery Wereabout ready you see The wind is fairand if nothing happens well be underway by dinner time The mate hasgone back on me and Ive sent afteranother manIn a few words the miner informedthe old seadog of his adventure the preceding evening addingThis is Mr Thomas Scott who savedmy life If it hadnt been for him youdhave sailed without me and now youvegot to take him too Hell pay the sameas I do and share my stateroom Is ita bargainHes welcome was the curt replyas long as hes to bunk in with youIve no other spare berthGood exclaimed Avery Come onScott well have to hurry up and getyour stuffToms companion was an old travelerand knew exactly what was requiredfor the voyage as well as where to obtain it and when the tug came alongside at noon our nero unci a wen niieqchest of clothing below and stood ondeck watching the operation of gettingunder wayMake that hawser fast livelyshouted a harsh voice near him andTom turned to see a short thicksetman bustling about and cursing thesailors roundly Ills face was turnedaway but there was something familiar in his bearing anct Tom was wondering at this when Capt CoffinshoutedLet the men get their dinner whilewe are towing down Mr RiderAye aye sirTom started as if he had been shotHe saw the mate turn towards the poopdeck as he replied and there was nomistaking his features The red facebushj beard and brutal mouth couldbelong to none other than Toms oldenemy Obed Rider who had broughtthe story of Capt Scotts flight to Merrivale If any further proof was needed his broken nose which added to therepulsiveness of his appearance wasnoticeable at the first glanceAs he caught sight of Tom he stoppedas if rooted to the deck and uttered anexclamation of amazement for the recognition was mutual Then an evillight blazed in his eyes and he boundedtowards Tom hissing through his setteethHow came you aboard this craftHis fists were clenched but he pausedbefore reaching striking distance forfour years had developed Tom Scottfrom a lanky boy into a tall muscularman and the same undaunted spiritnow looked boldly into the others eyesThe captain and the old miner wereboth below at the moment the formerhaving gone to his dinner after givingbis last order and the chief officer stoodsrlarinj at Tom like an enraged animalHe had been shipped at the last moment and had no knowledge of any passengers on board supposing Tom musthave been engaged as a common sailorWhat are you doin of on that quarter deck he demanded as Tom madeno reply to his first question Whatsthe matter with you Open youri mouth or Ill open it for you Whatare you doing hereNone of your business repliedTom finding his tongue at lastIll make it my business blamedquick cried the infuriated officer hiseyes snapping as he thought of the longvoyage ahead and his power to take hisrevenge tenfold on one under his authorityGet forward where you belong heshoutedTom understood now what was passing in the others mind but determinednot to undeceive the mate in order thatthe truth might be all the more crushing when made knownT wont stir a peg for you ObedRider he replied and if you are notcareful I will make your face look worsethan I did when I was a boyt Whatbad luck brought you here I dont knowbut I warn you to keep clear from meThe expression on the mates fsee wasfairly fiendish as he snatched an ironbelaying pin from the fife rail andrushed at Tom crying4You wont stir eh Curse you TOshow vou the difference between afloatand ashoreBut his blow was arrested in mid airby an iron grip about his wrist and theweapon was torn from his hand instantly He found himself pressed againstthe mizzenmast with a force that nearly took his breath away while Tom saidsternlyDont try that with me again or HInitch vou overboard I3aTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3 189As he poke he released the mate whosprang for the cabin steps his facecrimson with passion shoutingMutiny Mutiny Ill have yourlife for thisHe had reached the head of the stepswhen Capt Coffin appeared on thescene attracted by the mates loudtonesWhats the trouble here he demanded as the officer tried to push byhim on the stepIts mutiny sir was the angry reply Wait till I get my pistol and Illsoon settle itThe captain looked about him in surprise Tom stood alone on the quarterdeck and the whole matter was inexplicable unless the new mate was crazya thought which found ample justification in his disordered appearanceMutiny he repeated contemptuously See here if youve been drinking Mr Rider dont let it happen againI can make allowance for sailinsr daybut see it doesnt happen againI am as sober as you are was thesurly reply That man there ThatScott whelp He refused to obej meand Ill see whether I am mate of thisship or notWith one stride the eaptain reachedhis side and thrust his weather beatenface close to the mates giving him alook before which the other quailedLook you he said sharply Whenyou speak to me remember I have ahandle to my name and see you put iton every time You must be drunkThe mate looked from one to theother as if he could not believe his ownsenses What did it all mean Whydid the skipper refuse to side with himand allow Tom to stand there unmolested after assaulting his superior officerSeeing he could do nothing but glareat Tom the skipper turned to the latterand said coollyits tiext to impossible to get a soberman nowadays The best seamen allseem to make it a business to keepdrunk all the time they are ahoreAfter they get out to sea they nre allrightCapt Coffin said the mate stepping forward I have not touched adrop of liquor to day I ordered thisman to go forward and he resisted meOrdered him forward Well thats agood one And the captain broke intoa hoarse chuckle Why bless me butof course you didnt know Mr Scott isa passenger on the Seabird and is gointo Frisco with us Theres anotherdown below a Mr Avery Make you acquainted with Mr Scott Mr Scott thisS my mate Mr Rider Its all my faultrot telling him you was aboard Kinderfunny wasnt itWe dont need anr introductionsaid Tom quieklj I have known ObedRider a long time I dont know anygood of him eitherCapt Coffin was surprised but heasked no questions preferring to waitIll show you the differ ence between afloatand ashoreuntil he could see Tom alone Themate bit his lip in baffled rage as hesaw his prey not only removed from hispower but placed in a position wherehe must be treated with outward respect at least He turned on his heeland went forward vowing vengeanceunder his breath but not daring toshow his feeing further before the captainSo you know my mate then askedthe captain1 knew him years ago replied Tomand we had some trouble It doesntmatter what it was about but his nosegot broken and he hates me as hard asI do him He may be a good sailorhowever and no doubt he is He usedto sail with my fatherA hail from the tug saved Tom anfurther explanation and as the captainbustled off to reply Avery came cut ofthe cabin and joined his roommate whotold him briefly about the recent trouble making no mention of the originalcause of the enmity between himselfand Rider for the charge against hisfather was too sore a subject topass hislipsRy the time dinner was over the vessel was well down the harbor WhenRoston light was reached the westerlywind began to freshen and the sailsstood full Lines were hastily cast offthe rugs whistle gave a short blast asa parting salute and with a gracefulnod of her sharp bow in return thebark shot toward the open water withevery square inch of canvas pulling atthe sheets and the captain rubbing hishorny palms with delight at the prospect of a fine departureJohn Avery was an old sailor and themotion of the vessel caused him no inconvenience but Tom was soonstretched in his bunk where he remained the better part of two dayswhile the Seabird flew along before thefavorable gale In a manner which didnot belie her nameWhen he managed to get on deckCape Cod was more than 300 milesastern and already the weather wasbeginning to grow milder A few daysmore made him completely well andlong before the equator was reachedhe had acquired quite a professionalroll and felt perfectly at homeOf the mate he saw very little as thelatter stood watch and watch with thesecond officer being on deck everyother four hours night ad day MrGreen the second mate was a brightactive young man abcut Toms age andthe two became very friendly as theSeabird sped steadily to the southwardIt seemed a if old Neptune had madsan extra effort to help the vessel alonjfor she escaped the customary calmnear the line and caught the southeasttrades the same day she lost those frcaithe northeast which had served her sowell No incident of importance occurred to break the monotony of thevoyage and as they stood by the wheelone noon when Capt Coffin was takinghis observation he announced that theywere as far south of the line as Bostonwas north of itThen he went below to look at theglass cast a careful glance around thehorizon and went below once moreonly to reappear on deckThere Aint a cloud in the sky hesaid bluntly but the glass is goingdown as thotijb the bottom haddropped out of everything Were going to catch it as sure as my name isSeth Coffin My glass never lied to meyetGradually the wind died out until theSeabird la y becalmed rising and falling on the swell but the sky remainedclear The barometer continued to fallin an alarming manner and after anhour the heat became oppressiveThen from all quarters of the horizona mass of white clouds arose until theypresented the appearance of hugemountains of snow darkening as theyascended and massing together untilthey formed a canopy overhead entirely concealing the blue sky aboveSoon they deepened until the wholeheavens were solid black as if covered with folds of velvet In a fewplacs however the color seemed tovary to a dark purplish graj as oneecige of an overlapping cloud was exposedLong before this time all hands wereon deck and the Seabird was strippedfor the battle with the elements Whatever his other faults Obed Rider wasa good seaman and with but fewsuggestions from the captain he hadmade everything snug only a closereefed maintopsail and storm staysailshowing aft while a portion of theforetopmast staysail stood out whiteand clear against the irloomv background in readiness to pay her head offwhen neededThere was a painful stillness brokenonly by the mournful monotone in therigging which always precedes a hurricane as though the craft knew her danger and tried to utter her feeble protest against the forces of natureSuddenly far above the mastheadssounded an unearthly scream as if thestorm demons had united in soundingthe charge Still the sails hung idlyand not a breath of air could be feltThen in the far distance a longbright streak suddenly illuminated thehorizon increasing with marvelous rapidity until all could see what seemedto be an endless line of rolling snowIt was impossible to bring the vesselshead up to meet the danger withoutwind and she lay helpless in its pathrolling uneasily about on the disturbedseaTO BE CONTINUED-UNEXPECTED SUMMONSHow an American in Cuba Unwittingly Called Out the WholeArmyIn one of the old stories of Englishfolk lore we are told that in the caverns of Alderley Edge a ridge of highland are 999 horsemen ready to startinto action should the right bugle blowThe author of Cannon and Camerahad in Cuba his experience of a likeassembling With a party he was onhis way through mud and rain to aspot where he expected to get a fineview of SantiagoWe came to a river already muchswollen from the shower its streamrushing down in torrents from the hilltop Through this we were obligedto wade up to our armpits holding ourcameras and plates above our headsWhen we reached the dilapidated oldfort we fell in with the outpost of theCubans in front of San Juan We weretold that two or three days previousto our arrival the Spaniards had evacuated this fort very unceremoniouslyThis was the day after the battle withthe rough riders in which being routed they fell back on their main forcesabout two miles in the rearIn this old fort was a bell towercontaining a finely carved bell Something prompted me to go up into thetower and examine the bell Once therean impulse seized me to ring the belland I did it with alarming effect forout of hiding came every Cuban soldier for miles and miles all wildly gesticulatingI realized immediately that this wasthe signal for assembling in massshould the enemy be seen to advanceI shall never forget that sight so longas I live Of course I was admonishedfor doing it but when 1 assured everybody that my intentions were honestforgiveness

TreesMay Be Gone Other GrowthsSupplant ThemThe oaks of Chicago and its suburbsare going the way of all things mortalIt is predicted by nurserymen thatwithin a decade no heated city residentcan find a place of rest under the generous shade of one of these trees within 40 miles of the citys heartFor years the oak has been the characteristic tree of the lake shore section but the knell of its doom seems tohave been rung It is probable that before long Oak Park must take on a newname if the villagers wish to have allthings consistent Civilization is theenemy of the gnarled oak as it is theenemy of the squirrels that ate acornsin its branchesOn the South side in Chicago withinview of the cars from the elevated railroad there are square blocks on whichno buildings have been erected andwhich look desolate for within the lasttwo years the oak trees around themhave withered and died Their trunksstill tower and their branches spreadbut of green leaves there is not left avestigeThe nurserymen say Drainage hasdone this thing and that wherever adrainage pipe runs the oak must perishPersons interested in the beautifyingof their grounds having foreseen theinevitable dying of the oaks have beenexperimenting with other trees Theresult is that though the oak- with allthe associations which have clung tothat tree in every land in which itgrows must go there are other treesbeautiful in themselves which willthrive in the place which the old forestgiant has left vacantThe head gardener at Lincoln parkhas given some hints as to the comparative hardihood of trees and the kind ofsoil to which each tree is adapted Thecause of the death of the oaks he saysis the drainage of the soil the oak having a tap root which takes up a greatshare of the moisture necessary tor thetree The elm on the other hand has aspreading root and does not requireanything like the amount of moistureneeded by the oak Elms are thrivingall through the suburbs and in manyplaces in the heart of the city itselfThe soft maple and the catalpa arecoining to be characteristic trees of theNorth side The catalpa does especially well along the lake shore Some oithese trees planted nearly 20 years agoshow not a single dead twig Perhapsthe catalpas only drawback is the factthat the leaves drop early The softmaple will live and thrive if care betaken of it Wood boring insects like itand the branches break easilyThe cottonwoods and some varietiesof the poplar will thrive without morethan a modicum of care The balsampoplar however is apt to become theprey of insects while the Lombardypoplar which points like a lance to thesky is apt to be short lived amid thesurroundings of civilizationMany experiments have been made inChicago in the last ten years with theiolanthus or Tree of Heaven It is abeautiful shade tree and an exceedinglyrapid grower and insects seem to avoidit It needs however some degree ofshelter in severe winters though several of these trees in Lincoln park stoodthe extreme cold of last year withoutinjury The iolanthus in three yearsgrowth is of sufficient size to shade aporchGardeners say it is useless for cityresidents to plant pines or sprucesSmoke kills them A Norway maplewill do well under almost any conditions as will the Caroline poplar andsome other varieties of trees ChicagoTribuneWOMEN BUYING RIFLESLarge Increase in the unilier WhoGo Hunting with TheirHusbandsInquiries of some of the chief dealersin sporting guns show that their seasons trade has been especially activethis month Shotguns are briskly soldbut there is a very lively demand forsporting rifles for which women customers are partly responsibleYou would be surprised said thehead of one large establishment toknow how the number of women whogo shooting with their husbands orbrothers has increased in the last sixor eight weeks No I dont think thechange is wholly due to the athleticwoman It seems to me that most ofthe women who go in for shooting doso because when the husband goes offon a shooting trip he wants to take hiswife with him and let her have a sharein the funThe women come in here with theirmenfolk sometimes and they pick upa gun with no more idea how to hold itthan if it was a lasso I dont thinkthere has been more than one womanin this store who took up a gun as ifshe knew how to handle it No theyare no more difficult customers thanmen If a man isnt an expert himselfhe goes to some friend who thinks heis an expert and asks his advice Theman who has been shooting for severalyears thinks he knows it all and thatwe dont know anything So the newhand comes in here full of infallibleadvice and its hard work to suit himWeve got everything but he cant decideThe women know they dont knowand we can suit them quickly We sellthem a very light rifle 30 caliber withsmokeless powder and long bullets ikethose of the navy rifleYes they say that they can shootand kill deer too But the way theyhandle guns here doesnt look muchlike it N Y PostThe Wifes

turtlejust shot out his long neck got a goodgrip on the duck and hung on afterthe calm impartial manner of snappingturtlesSi carried duck and snapping turtleback to his house and as there wasntany way of making the turtle let go hecut off the prrt where the turtle hadfastened his grip on the unlucky duckNow Si is the happiest contentedestman in the world when he can getsomewhat else to do his work and hefigured over the duck-and-turtle problem for quite awhileDucks is inquisitive by nature hesays to his wife always wanting to findout just what anything new is Snapping turtles have no particular feelingagainst ducks but they might betaught to have Blamed if I dont thinkIve struck a great combinationSo Si goes over to the creek andcatches four young snapping turtlesThen he gets a stuffed duck and beginsthe work of training lie would takethe duck and poke it right in the faceof a turtle Out would come the turtles head and he would make a snap atthe duck Then Si would pull the duckback and with a little stick he had beenholding back out of sight of the turtle he would give the turtle a whackon the back or hind legs The turtlesattention being concentrated on theduck he wouldnt blame Si for theblow with the stick but would lay it ailto the inoneent stuffed duck Snappingturtles aint any too lovable by nature and these young ones of Sis soonbegan to connect the appearance of aduck With a whack of a stick Ducksfust drew out all the evil in those snapping turtles natures The sight of aduck had the same effect on them thata red rag does on a bull You could seetheir little eyes gleam it made themso mad Hut a snapping turtle knowsthat running aint its main hold andSiV turtles would just lay back withtheir heads under their shells as innocent looking as conld be until stuffedduck wets near enough for them toiiata chance to grab it Then they wouldshoot out their heads and if they gota hold heaven and earth wouldnt makethem let go They tore up a considerable number of ducks before Si gotthem trained but Si didnt careDont you worry he says to biswife The snapping Mfl ansuv xt T I will furiualiTHE BOUUBON NEWS PAKIS KY FRIDAY NOVEMBER 3 1899the snapping qualities and 1 will supplythe brain work and the combinationwill make Pike county ducks wearySi always fed the turtles and gavethem fresh water and soft mud to lie inThe result was that while these misguided turtles hated ducks worse andworse each day they thought the worldof Si would scramble out of theirmud whenever Si came into the pen hekept them in and follow7 him about likea lot of unusually clumsy puppies Byand by Si thought he had his turtlestrained all right so he got reader toput his duck catching plans into operation First he made four little floatslike little rafts Then he slipped aring overa hind leg of every turtle andfastened a turtle on each float Thenhe put some mud on the floats and scattered corn over the mud When nightcame he set the rafts floating out inthe lake each being fastened to theshore by a long cordThe nights beingcold said Si thoseintelligent turtles of mine are going tobury themselves in the mud Ducksare curious and hungry at this time ofyear and they will be sure to go nosing about those innocent looking floatswith the corn on them But when anyintruding duck in picking up corntreads on one of these turths somethingentirely new to ducks is going to besprung on him all of a suddenThe next morning Si went aroundto look at his turtle traps Sure enougheach turtle was holding a duck Si drewthe floats to shore and was cutting theducks loose preparatory to wringingtheir necks when along comes a gameconstableSee here says the constable Whatdo you mean by catching ducks out ofseasonI aint catching them growled SiAnybody but a dang fool constablecould see the turtles caught the ducksYou mustnt let your turtles catchducks replies the constable sort ofdoubtfulSi just grinned T aint a lawyer heays sarcastic like but I never heardof anything in the laws of the state ofPennsylvania making a closed duck season for snapping turtles Thems theculprits he says pointing to the foursnapping turtles Go explain the lawto them Theyve got more intelligencethan some officers of the law who aintso very far off at the present minuteAnd he went on gathering in the captive ducksThe constable was madder than ahornet but not knowing of any law applying to trained snapping unties hewent without saying a word Si tookhis ducks to the village and ducks being scarce got a g cd price for themThen the real natui t of the man showedupIf these pet turtles of mine cargather in ducks at night why cantthey in the day he says to his wifeTheyve been taking things easy allspring and summer Let them do somework now to pay for the care Ive lavished on themSo Si put the turtles out on thefloats again that afternoon He hid inthe bushes alongside of the lake andafter four more misguided ducks hadgot tangled up with the turtles Sipulled in the floats Instead of givingthe faithful turtles a little rest fromtheir labors he shoved the floats outagainThose turtles are doing their dutyfaithfully I said to him Dont workthem to death Even a snapping turtlehas its rights which ought not to betrampled onBut no that didnt suit Si He hada good thing and he was going to workit to death All that night and all thenext day Si kept the patient little animals at work gathering in ducks Thereaint an animal in the world that willstick to a job better than a snappingturtle but when Si finally gathered uphis ducks and started for home it wasplain those turtles were about wornout seemed puzzled too Therethey had been catching ducks for twodays nights and days and not a duckdid thev have that thev could call theirownSi is running this show and it mustbe all right they seemed to be sayingto themselves as they waddled homebut it is blamed queer where all ourducks areIf Si had acted half way decentabout the matter he might have keptthe love and trust of these turtles andaccumulated ducks for himself all theyear around They werent unreasonable turtles and they thought the worldof Si A duck here and there wouldhave satisfied them and Si could havehad the rest But when Si routed theturtles out early the next morning andstarted them off on the floats anyonecould see they were not feeling cheerfuland satisfiedBe careful Si I says to him oryou will lose the esteem of those turtles A snapping turtle that feels hisconfidence has been misplaced is anugly animal to deal withBut no Si was after ducks andducks he would have if he worked thoseturtles until they dropped All day andal night he kept thein on the floats tearing the ducks away as scon as a turtlecaught one Then after giving themonly a couple of hours rest he tried tostart them at work again Then thestrike began Si tried to get the turtlesto come out of their mud in the pen andstart for the lake although they wereso tired their poor legs would hardlycarry them But he had reached thelimit of snapping turtle good natureNot a turtle would budge out of themud but when Si made a quaekirgnoise like a duck which was the signalfor the turtles to start for the lake eachturtle tried to bury himself deeper inthe mud Then Si was madIll taoh these loafing turtles thatwhile ducks are plentiful theyve gotto work No tramj turtles are goingto be allowed on the Evershed farmdozing in the mud and neglecting theiropportunities to n ske hay wJiletVvicksire gdeatttnL With that 8i ges i stickiand having routed the turtles out of thmud he began to pound themWell they were the most surprisedturtles you ever saw At the first blowof the stick each turtle stuck his headout from under his shell and lookedaround for a duck They had been accustomed to connect blows with hestick and ducks First they prrkedtheir heads about in a wondering wayThen the turtles looked at Si as if asking him Where are the ducks Sididnt appreciate the mix up he wacausing in the minds of those turtlesbut kept on hitting them with the stickand trying to persuade them to go tothe lake and resume their labors atduck huntingDont tell me that turtles and especially trained turtles like those ofSis cant think It was plain howthose poor turtles felt First it wasjust surprise at not seeing any duckswhen they were hit with the stickThen it was disappointment a sort ofreluctant loss of faith in human natureCould it be that the poundings they hadexperienced from their youth up hadbeen due to Si the man they lookedup to and reverenced and not to thehated ducks Why it was just like telling a man that his whole religion is alie A turtles mind doesnt work anytoo quickly and these turtles werethrown all in a daze at being beatenby Si Evershed the man who had fedthem and whom they had trusted andi j E12 11 1 a1 - AiutcUj riimii me i nines gae n upin a despairing sort of way and waddled off toward the pond and theirdaily task But it was plain they weredoing some mighty hard thinkingWhen they got to the pond Si beingout of humor at the strike of the turtlesjust tied them on their floats and tossedthe floats out in the lake in a carelessway as if he didnt care whether hisfaithful turtles drowned or not Thefloats turned up all right in the endbut not before the turtles had got goodand wet That added to the grievancesof the urtles and helped turn themfrom respectable hard working duckcatchers into vagrant snapping turtlesready to bite the hand which fed themThe ducks were getting cautious of1hose turtle floats and i wasnt untilnearly night that each turtle hadcaught a duck The w it didnt improve Sis temper When the floatswere full Si hauled them in shoreThen he grabbed a duck and tried toyank it away from the turtle whichwas elinging to it Of coarse this onlymade the turtle hold on Phe harderIesky little varmint says Si Illteach you to hold on to my ducks Sotaking a stick Si began to whack theturtle over the headPatience isnt the main virtue of asnapping turtle even of a trained oneAnd these turtles had a list of grievances which they had been broodingover all ihe time they hail been on thefloats First they had been workedovertime then they had made the discovery that Si Evershed and not theducks was responsible for the beatings they had suffered they had beentossed out in the lake as if no one caredwhether they were drowned or notand finallv after thev had laid asidemalice and each caught a duck theoldest and best turtle had been poundedover the head with a stick That settled the matter Each turtle was determined he would do no more workfor Si Evershed It may take a trainedsnapping turtle quite awhile to decidewhat to do but they are mighty quickto act when their minds are made upSi was pounding the long sufferingturtle over the head when all of a sudden the turtle let go of the duck Thenext second he had his jaws settled inSis big toe Si forgot all about theduck For the next few seconds hewas bus dancing about swearing andtrying to get his toe free from thatonce faithful but now exasperated turtle Ordinarily a snapping turtle hangson like death But it was different withthis turtle He didnt so much want tohave revenge on Si as to emphasize thefact that he hadnt been fairly treatedPretty soon the turtle let go of Sistoe Si dropped on the ground in aheap holding on to his injured toe andcursing the ingratitude as he calledit of the turtleBut while that particular turtle hadbeen making things interesting for Sithe others had been busy in a waywhich showed they appreciated thestrike was on Each turtle helped biteoff the cord by which another turtlewas tied to a float Then when theturtle which had been pinching Si letgo the other turtles waddled over andset that turtle free Each turtle couldthen go where he pleased And eachturtle made up his mind that his daysof duck catching for Si Evershed wereover then and there By the time Si hada little recovered from the pain in histoe the four turtles had reached theedge of the lake There they stoppedfor a second turned around took alast look at Si and then plunged in thelake And that was the last ever seenof Si Eversheds duck catching snapping turtlesThem turtles never would havestruck if I had treated them half waydecent Si says to me mournfullyThat last look they gave me was moredumb reproach than anger N YSunIons Service in a ChoirThere are probably not many

to study the Navajo tribeTn 1868 it numbered 12000 souls To dayhrough natural increase and nothrough immigration almost entirelywithout admixture of other blood thereare 22000 Navajos Every individualvribesman appears prosperous Manyvf the bucks are rich even from thestandpoint of the white man It isroughly though conservatively estimater that the tribe has 1600000 sheep60000 head of cattle 300000 goats andhorses in such numbers as almost todefy enumeration Horseflesh indeedis one of the main food staples Theponies not necessarily of poor stockare unsalable even at three dollars alead A very large percentage of thewool crop is sold for shipment to Boston just as is sold the crop of the whitewnolgrower The Navajo blankets areitill famous though the better specimens are to be had only on paymentof seemingly exorbitant prices One ofthe main sources of the tribes revenuenow Is from the sale of blankets thatcost the purchaser little if any morethan would blankets of ordinary millmanufacture Most of this modernweaving is done singular to relatewith ordinary German town yarnbrought to Arizona for the Indians bythe car load If special colors are required by the Indian weavers recourseis had to common dyes Yet despitethis strange admixture of aboriginahandicraft and modern convenience theIndian has never before BO prosperedLittle assistance is received by thetribe from the general government consisting only in occasional gifts of wagons and agricultural implements andin the support of schools Throughouthe Navajos have an independence thais refreshing While thev have a history far from peaceful the casual traveler across the reservation is as safeas he would be in a New England village Prospectors they di like a dislike shared by nearly all southwesterntribes But they appreciate fully thepower of the great chief in YYashintona and rarely molest fellow tribesmen or whites Rugged health is theattribute of almost every individualand there is every indicationthat coming centuries will knowthe Navajos as one of themost considerable of the subdivisionsof population in the southwestThe Navajo reservation is the largest in the union Yet already it is toosmall for the expanding tribe a fact appreciated in the Indian bureau Negotiations are in progress for the purchase by the government of a considerable number of land claims to the westward of the reservation When thesehave been secured the reservation linewill be moved a number of miles further toward the setting sun This advance of the Indian has in it nothing tocause apprehension to the white population of northern Arizona A largepart of the region now and hereafterto be occupied is only grazing land atthe best abounding in scenic featuresbut lacking in waterThe main property rights to be secured are at Tuba City on Moen CopieWash 90 miles north of Flagstaff HenMormons numbering 13 families havbeen settled for 15 years They cultivaet about 300 acres of land irrigatedby a never failing flow from MoenCopie creek At Tuba is expected toarise the metropolis of the NavajosWhen the Mormons are dispossessed therich land will be divided up among anumber of the more industrious Indians and to start them w11 in modern husbandry the irrigation systemis to be remodeled on the most approvedlines On the site of the present tradersstore will be built an Indian school forwhich an

Fine San Francisco Feline Submitsto the Knife WithoutResistanceMaltese tats are in large demandamong business houses not only because of their beauty but because theyhave proved themselves to be fine hunters One of the handsomest of theseis Tom a magnificent fellow belongingto a wholesale grocer in lower California street or perhaps it would bemore correct to say that the cat ownsthe establishment He spends his nightsin useful labor and is sometimes for aconsiderable period found reguiarlyeach morning with a big dead rat bvhis side fur like most of the genuinely capable of his kind he disdains to eathis game During the day he has appropriated to his own use a nicely finished irail tray on the office desk andwhen the weather is cool a big nickellamp standing beside the tray is keptburning for his especial benefit A fitof indigestion very nearly carried himoft one day and it became necessary toperform a surgical operation to savethe noble fellows life He seemed toknow that the veterinary surgeons Iancct was unsheathed for his good andbore the pain like a stoic and wfthoutresistanceY inr with Tom in beautv and intelligence and hi almost exact counterpart in size and appearance is Joe asplendid maltesc of Petaluma birth belonging to a wholesale boot and shoehouse on the corner of Second and Stevenson streets Eyes of amber a coatpf silky blue gray sinewy frame andeonine rather than tigerish face Joeis a magnificent specimen of cathoodHe not only answers to his name butunderstands and will obey simple directions issued by his master jumping on desk or chair at his bidding orplaying with a cord strung across theentrance in the office railAn instance of cat devotion of an extraordinary sort is found in a wholesale dairy establishment on the eastside of Front street near CaliforniaHere is a wee motherless gray kittenso small that it can sit comfortabty onones hand In the store are five growncats common cats of no pedigree tomsand tabbies and this elder band hasassumed maternal care of the forlornlittle orphan They watch it vigilantly seeming particularly apprehensivelest it stray out upon the street andwhenever one of them perceives him toonear the open doors the older fellowwalks over to the kitten picks it upin its mouth and gravely carries it backand deposits it in the rear of the storeSan Francisco ChronicleAMERICANS FOND OF EGGSPer Capita Consumption of Hen Fruitin This Country- About150 YearlyAn English statistician has estimatedthat the use of eggs in the United Kingdom amounts to about 42 e per yearfor each head of population IJut according to available American statistics this would be altogether too lowOS estimate for the consumption inthis countrv When one begins to firurc en probable cga production in theUnited Slates startling figures are encountered Considering that a population of about 4000000 people is servedWith eggs from the receipts at NewYork city the consumption in this vicinity would seem to be about 250 eggsper vcaifor each person Probably thisis a greater average consumption thanwould be found to prevail in the wholecountry but it would be reasonable toestimate an average of 150 eggs foreach person in the United Statesabout three eggs per week each Thiswould necessitate a production of say10500000000 eggs about 2GC00000cases averaging 400 eggs each WhenIt is considered that the receipts inNew York alone are about one tenthof this amount while the populationusing the New York receipts is littlemore than one twentieth of the wholeit would seem certain that the aboveestimate is below rather than abovethe factIf all these eggs were placed in a rowlengthwise they would form a solidchain of eggs nearly 340000 miles longlong enough to encircle the earthmore than 14 times or to reach 100 COOmiles beyond the moon If they werepacked in cases of an average size andthese were piled on top of each otherin the usual way they would make atower of egg cases over 5000 miles highor they would stretch 10000 miles ifthe cases were placed end to end Ifthe hens of the country average 105eggs per year each this rate of production would indicate a population of100000000 hens not to speak of roostersand nonlaying chickens At an averageprice of 12 cents per dozen the egg cropat this rate of calculation would represent a value of 105000000 per yearChicago ChronicleValue
