Bourbonitesto Meet Minneapolis
The Bourbonitss will meet the Min
neapolis club, the champions of the
American Association' l2Bt season,
Thursday and Friday, March 30 and
31, at White Part in this city in the
first game of the season on the local
grounds.
Workmen are encaged vdaily in the
task of putting the grounds in the
proper condition and everything will
be in readiness when the Association
champions arrive in Paris. The in
field is rapidly assuming a condition
that would do credit to "Toppy" Nix,
the erstwhile groundkeeper, in mid
season, and everything. will be in tip
top shape when Dawson, Altrock,
Wadell and company arrive for the
two tilts on the local lot.
While the season for reporting is
rather permature, still every man who
will don a Bourbonite outfit is under
contract to do service for a time at
least, and they will not be a lot of
"hired" players for this occasion
alone. Earnetr, McKernan, Kuhlman
and Chapman, with one exception all
that remains of the great tribe that
carried away the penant last season,
will be seen in their old positions.
For the Association champions
Wadell and Altrock Swill do some of
the hurling, while ; big "Hub" Daw
son, a Blue Grass League product,
who has risen from the ranks of the
minors, will probably do some of the
hackstopping at one of the sessions.
President Bacon has handed out the
following to compose the Paris team :
Barnett, first base ; McKernan, sec
ond base; Rapp, short; Kuhlman, third
base; Mayer, catcher; Yerkes, center
field ; Chapman, left field Holson,
right field ; Schrander, Woods, Brown,
Barnett and Holleran, pitchers.

What the April Woman's Home
Companion Contains.
The April number of Woman's Home
Companion is brimful, pressed down
and overflowing with the spirit of
Easter. It is a riot of joyousness, cf
frilly Easter frocks, of new tspring
hats, of gardens, music, verse and en
tertaining fiction. But underneath the
sparkle and lightness of the surface
attractions of this magazine lies the
splendiud bedrock of all its helpful de
partments and strong special articles.
The fiction in the April Woman's
Home Companion includes the second
part of "The Flight of the Magic Car
pet," a charming story of love, adven
ture and a motor car by C. !N. and A.
M. Williamson; "Mrs. Benson's
Brains" by Anne Warner, a homely
little tale of a mother who thought she
had very little "brains" but proved
the contrary; other contributes are
Mary Heaton Vorse, Maude Kadford
Warren, Grace M. Siesons and Louise
Forsslund. j
In Eascer sermon by Dr. Charles E. '
Jefferson, pastor of the Broadway
Tabernacle, New York City, is one of
the features of the April Woman's
Home Companion. This number also
contains an Easter hymn by Richard
Leallienne, illustrated by Earl Stetson
Crawford, and an article on suffrage.
"Why I Want the Ballot." Time was
when a man scorned to read a woman's
magazine. That time is long past ana
the "man of the house" will be' keenly
interested in Mr. John D. Adams' ar
ticle on "Furniture Making," which
includes a design, and working draw
ings of a comfortable porch swing.
Spring house cleaning and general
overhauing will lose its terrors for the
young housekeeper if she will read and
put into practice the "First Princi
ples" of this important subject, com
piled by Mrs. Christine Terhune Her
nck. It is possible to ririry the "Com
forts of home" even tnoi'h the awful
hour of stock-taking am . --novation is
at hand, we are told in ti. April Wom
an's Home Companion, j itle gardens
and big gardens, flower aim vegetable
gardens--they all have a corner of this I
splendid Easter number."
Columbus Placed in Class With
Dr. Cook.
Simultaneously with the erection of
a colossal statue in honor of Christo
pher Columbus at Buenos Ayers wiil
ne published in Paris, France, Satur
day two volumes of a work by Henry
Vignaud, first secretary of the Ameii
can embassy, in which the discoverer
of America is branded an impostor and
a humbug and placed in a clas with
explorers like Dr. Ccok.
Mr. Vignaud retired from the
American embassy two years ago and
has since devoted his entire time to
the completion of 'a study of Colum
bus, which has consumed in all fifty
years. The author is now eighty-one
years of age. He is celebrated as a
historian, and was consulted recently
by the Pope when it was proposed to
cannonize Columbus. At that time.
Mr. Vignaud showed that the explorer!
was anything Out a sairtly man, and t
tnat ne nau at ,sast one illegitimate,
son.
In his study of Columbus Mr. Vig
naud undertakes to prove that the ex
plorer's discovery of America was not
the result of his own genius, that the
expedition was not based upon scien
tific data, but that Columbus actually
learned ct the existence of America
from an ignoiantjsailor who had been
there ahead of him. In a word, that
America was discovered Jon before
Columbus ever organized his expe
dition, and that he merely took the
credit from anotner manunknown to
history. -
