fact that the wholeof the Visayas group was in possessionof the Filipino forces Gen Otis wasordered to take possession of the entirearchipelago and dispatched troops andwar ships to the Southern VisayasThe Filipinos according to the juntarepresentatives are determined to prevent the landing of the Americansat Iloilo and may as a last resort destroy the cit for strategical purposesThe junta insist that a rupture ofthe friendly relations existing betweenthe Filipino national governmentand the American executive is imminent and that hostilities arehle unless what they characterize asthe unreasonable unfair and overbearing policy of the Americans ismodified They say the Filipinoswould deepty regret such a rupturebut would accept it as inevitableIn concluding the interview thespokesman

atits meeting Friday gave special consideration to the administration of affairs in Cuba There seems to be amisunderstanding- among some of thepeople of Santiago as to the policy ofthe government with respect to the expenditure of money collected from internal revenue and customs sourcesIt not believed that GenWood who is in command at Santiagomisunderstands the purposes of thegovernment but in any event nothingwill be done in the matter until JenWood arrives here Then an effortwill be made to arrive at some generalplan for the handling of the receiptsin the island It seems certain however that all moneys disbursed mustcome through a central head andthat under no circumstances can anyparticular city or section be allowed toexpend all of its collections to the neglect of other sections Gen Woodhowever will receive a proper andprobably a sufficient allowance forSantiago province but full consideration is certain to be given to sectionswhich collect nothing or littlefrom customs It is very likelythat soon after Gen Woods return toSantiago the governors of the severalprovinces will be instructed to assemble for a discussion of the question oftheir respective needs for administrative purposes and alio for pressing internal improvements Thus it is expected a fair and equitable distribution of the funds collected on theisland will be securedNothing1 of special interest had beenreceived by the government from Iloilo Although much interested in theprogress of events there the administration has full confidence in its representatives on the ground and no further action will be taken until something further is learned as to thesituation As soon as the treaty is ratified by the senate the president it isexpected will make any changes thatmay have been found to be necehsaryin matters of administration to the endthat his instructions to Gen Otis andby him proclaimed to the people maybe fully carried out in letter and inspiritHON JOSEPH D SAYER3Recently

Rebellion Spreads Over thePhilippine Inlands Natives FleeingFrom the City Far AttackManila Jan 7 It is apparent thattin situation here has not been improved by the proclamation issued byGen Otis Wednesday evening Thereia a feeling of unrest among the people and it is feared by them that theinsurgents in arms may attempt someovert act against the AmericansSome native families here are moving or preparing to move to the provinces believing that Aguinaldosforces will attack the city The trainsrunning to interior points are crowdedwith persons seeking refuge in thecountry from the anticipated attackExcitement here among the Americans increases with every hours delay in the arrival of definite news fromIloiloThere is no longer any doubt thatthe insurgents are in full control of theVisyas group and it is even probablethat they hare taken up arms throughout the entire islands The past fewmonths have been spent by Aguinaldoit is supposed passing from island toisland and stirring up feeling againstthe Americans For a long time thetricky leader was missing from hisheadquarters at Mololos and it wasthen that he planted the seeds of rebellion among the most distant of theislanders The Americans have awakened to the fact that bloodshed is sureand that a serious job awaits themThe fear that Aguinaldo and his Luzon forces may close in around Manilahas gained much headway althoughsuch a move is hardly possible sincethe Americans are well fortified andcould beat them at every turnIt is more than likely that Gen Miller in command at Iloilo will hold offuntil he can learn the number of insurgents centered there for there mustbe no chance of defeat when he landsand attempts to retake the cityNEW ARMY ORDERS ISSUEDStrinjjent Regulations for the

Scout Convinced aSkeptical Colonel AboutIndiansYou gentlemen who have served insouthwestern Texas began a jollyWest Point captain while sitting before the campiire wAh the volunteerrecently have seen the Semirolenegro Indian scouts In the early 80swhen I was a lieutenant my regimenwas stationed at old Fort Clark andwas asKigned to command these samescoutsSouthwestern Texa at that tiie wma pretty wild stretch of country Civilization stopped at San Antonio andthe duty of these negro Indians was tokeep that border free from smugglersmarauding parties and hostile IndiansOnce every four months they came toClark for their money and then youwill pardon the expression gentlementhere was h 1 to payThe men had had a good manyharp brushes with the redskins andwhen they were warmed up with liquorthey liked to tell of thene affairs Thecommander at Fort Clark was a littleskeptical about these Indian storioand one day he said to me in a jokingway I dort believe there is an Indianin West Texas and Ill give 50 to anyman in your command who will brinp ina dead redskinThere was one Mexican in the command Julian L ongonio by name and hewas one of the best trailers the southwest ever saw Longon io heard the colonels remark and his beadlike eyessnapped as he turned away For myself 1 thought no more of it until it wasforcibly recalled to my mind sometimelaterThe next day we left Fort Clark fora scout ing trip At Newton where theLas Moras empties into the IiiofirandeLongon io rode up and asked permissionto cross the river Fancying that hewanted to visit some friends and knovthat there was no immediate needof his services I rediiy gave my consent The greaser swam his pony acrossthe river and disappeared in the chaparralThe next I saw of him was two daysafter when I rode into Fort Clark fomy mail In the afternoon Longonior down to the officers line andstopped in front of the adjutants officeSeveral officers were standing aroundand gazed in open mouthed astonishment at sight of the Mexican with adead Indian behind him He refusedto answer any of their queries andasked for el colonel Hearing thecemnootion the colonel came out and before he could say anything Julian cutthe rope that bound the Indian to hissaddle threw the corpse on the porchxat the colonels feet and in that softdrawling voice so peculiar to the Mexican saidCincuenta pesos senor el colonelWell gentlemen the colonel was sothunderstruck at first that he waspeechless but recovering himself presently he gave Longonio such a cussingout as I never heard before nor sinceThe Mexican sat like a sphinx on hishorse pretending not to understandEnglish and when the colonel wasthrough he simply pointed to the deadIndian and again saidCincuenta pesos senor el colonelHe got his cincuenta pesos finallybut the colonel intimated that if he evercaught him around there again hedhne him shot Longonio pocketed themonev and rode awav with a broadgrin on his face to rejoin the scouts Itseems he had lassoed the Indian firstand started to bring him in alive butafter dragging him a mile over the cactus plain poor Los spirit fled and another bad Indian was made a good onevia the Paradise Valley

typical dairy formThis cow has proved herself to be oneof the greatest dairy cows living and aithe same time she captivates the eye byher wonderful beauty of form Shehas the general wedge shape of bodythe round barrel the loose soft skinand golden color the clean cut headand waxy horns and above all perhapsa wonderful development of uddernot so remarkable in size as in l s splendid shape particularly in the forepartNote the exceeding fullness in the forepart of the udder in distinction to thepinched appearance so often seen inthat part Her teats are large and finelyplaced and in general there is the lookof the almost perfect cow about hertbke her where you willPerfection of form will noc guarantee excellence at the pail an churnbut the possession of it goes a longway toward giving confidence that tlupossessor of it has the best dairy qualities as well as the possession of dairyshape On the other hand I have rarely seen a cow with an absence of theoutward marks which are accepted asmeatinar quality that has proved tobe ol any particular merit Others mayhave found merit occasionally in cowtnat are without dairy form or featurebut this surely has been exceptionalIn buying dairy cows the wise courseis to consult the ancestry o the animals meanwhile comparing the cowspoint by point with the ideal buttercow an ideal form that to me at leastis not far away from the shape of Signals Lily Flag which is here delineatedOne has only to go about eventhrough what are called our best dairydistricts to note the great prevalenceof cows with small pinched udderssmall irregularly placed teats flatsides and light hindquarters Someherds seem hardly to be relieved by tnpresence of even one cow that carriesin her body the signs of excellence atthe churn It is small wonder then thatwe find such herds averaging 200 to 250pounds of butter a year with some ofthe cows probably not producing- moretitan 150 pounds a ear if as much asthat There are thousands of cows inevery state that are being kept at anactual loss the owners not knowing itbecause they never test their cowseither scientifically with a Cabcocktester or practically by setting themeasured milk of each cow hy itselffor seven days or even for one day andnoting the result in cream and butterThis would show at once the cows thuare queering the dairy business Andwhen the owner of a herd has thusweeded out the poor cows I am quitesure he iviJiii thai practically all ofthese discredited animals are marked lvdeficient in the accepted dairj formWebbDoenelkin Country GentlemanFRESH DAIRY

AIDWby lie National jovcrnmcnt SbonlcTake a Molc Interest in liundImprovementAnother expression in favor of having congress take action on the subjectof road improvement appears in theGreenville Mich Democrat in an interview with Dr A V Nichols Thedoctor speaks of the necessity of having better roads and then continuesI believe that this country willnever have good roads until the government has adopted the policy of supervision and construction of the sameMost of the civilized governments ofthe old world have built their roads bygovernment appropriationsGovernment appropriations for goodroads would not be felt but would be abenefit by wa of clean ug farms ofStone and giving employment to laborThe importance of roads foimilitary purposes leading into the interior territories and to the frontierwas early appreciated and some important routes were opened by the g neral government as the national roadfrom Baltimore through Wheeling andCincinnati to St Louis and that fromBangor to Houlton in Maine -It has been estimated that 20000000 appropriated by the governmentamong the several states in proportiono their agricultural population andthat sub divided and distributed amcrgthe counties of each state in proportionto the agricultural population of eachcounty would give the average agricultural counties of this state from15000 to 25000 each and in 12 or 15yeais time the counties would be provided with good macadamized roadsprovided stone were reasonably accessible I believe in liberal appropriations for all the departments ofour government but I cannot see whythe great agricultural interests shouldbe neglected If our billion dollar congresses would appropriate the smallamount of 20000000 a year for goodroads it could not in my judgment bebetter applied in developing our country and at the same time meet thewants of our people especially m theagricultural districtsThe importance of good roads is becoming so well recognized that they rea probability of the near future andtheir cause should be championed incongress as soon as possible Thus farof late years all moneys used in theconstruction of good roads have beensecured by a direct tax upon the peopleliving along the lines of such roads orthose living in the counties or stateswhere such roads are located and hasproven a heavy burden upon those people - The government canconduct this matter much better thanstates and the revenue required tomeet the expenditure would be so smaJlthat it would not be even felt by thepeople The coffers of thegovernment are now being filled tooverflowing under the present systemof revenue and the war taxes could bereduced many times and yet have suf Ificlent funds to meet this appropriation of 20000000 annually for goodroads and at the same tine leave allother departments of the governmentwell provided forI believe that if a member of congress would champion government appropriations for good roads thst hewould find no diflicultv in securingpetitions signed by a large majority ofthe people urging the enactment ofsuch a law Let the peoplewake up on the subject of good roadsand national appropriations for thesame for it will benefit the farmer morethan any other improvement that 1know of and giv employment to laborand would likewise proveto all interests of the count r especially to interior cities and villagesEFFECTIVE

the energy expended is wasted Topush the snow for example out at thefides of the read simply results in adeep cut which soon fills up especiallyif it is drifting and so does not gie ahard track for
