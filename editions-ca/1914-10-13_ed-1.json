1914, and especially to the first para
graph thereof, and for amendment say
that they are and each of them is a
citizen and resident of the United
States of America; that they and each
of them is engaged in the business of
selling spirituous, vinous and malt
liquors by retail, in Paris, Bourbon
County, Kentucky, by license, and are
authorized to conduct said business in
said territory by virtue of license
granted to each of them by the United
States of America, Commonwealth of
Kentucky, and the City of Paris; and
that the license of them and each of
them were on September 28, 1914, and
now in full force and effect.
And they come and amend the
twelfth ground of contest heretofore
filed, and for amendment thereto 'say
that in Millersburg Precinct No. 1,
Richard (Fick) Wasson and J. H. Tay
lor were appointed by the Board of
Election Commissioners of Bourbon

lor were selected from the list of
names furnished by those who favored
the sale, barter and loan of spirituous,
vinous and malt liquors; that both
said Wasson and Tayror were late and
were not at the polling place at six

morning, and within thirty minutes af-
ter six o'clock a. m., they were not af-
loAved to. take their places as officers
ot said election for sometime after
'they came, and until more than forty
votes naa been cast in said precinct,
and for these reasons the contestants
say that the election held in Millers
burg Precinct No. 1, on September 28,
1914, upon said propositidn, was ille
gal and void, and of no effect and was
not free and equal.
As a further amendment to said,
grounds they say that in Millersbure
fcPrecinct No. 2, on said date the elec
tion commissioners of Bourbon Coun
ty, had appointed J. H. Stewart and
Henry Bowling sheriff and judge' re
spectively, from the list of names fur
nished by those opposed to said propo
sition, and had appointed John B. Vi
mont, judge, and V, L. Barton, clerk,
from a list furnished by those favor
ing said proposition, and that on the
morning of the electfon and without
waiting thirty minutes after the open
ing of the polls at six o'clock, the per
sons opposing the sale, barter or loan
of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors,
selected one O. H. Collier, who was
opposed to said proposition to act as
clerk at said election in said precinct,
wrongfully and unlawfully, and
wrongfully and unlawfully compelled ly to druggists."
V. L. Barton, who had been appointed , contestants say that the said propo
cierk to act as judge. sition petitioned for was not authoriz-
The contestants further say that at ed Djr law; and ttat tne proposition
said precinct those favoring said prop- on which the election was ordered
osition had selected a qualified person to be heid was not the proposition pe
to act as challenger at said election 'titioned for and was not the proposi
and had issued to him the proper cre-(tion authorized by law to be submit
dentials as such and that the 'officers .ted and the proposition which was
of election in said precinct wrongfully inted the official Daliots, which
and unlawfully refused admission to;were actuaiiy submitted to the voters
the election booth to said challenger, , of Bourbon County, was not the prob
and they state that because of the . osition authorized by law to be sub-
iiictLLeifc aim Liiiugs ueiem scl out mac
the election held in Millersburg Pre
cinct No. 2, was not free and equal
and was therefore null and void.
For further amendment to the said
eround of contest they say that in
Clintonville Precinct No. 2, the officers
of eleclion selected from a list of
those favoring the sale, barter and
loan of spirituous, vinous and malt
liquors, were "not at the polls on the
morning of said election at six o'clock
a. m., and that -without waiting until
half past six a. m., as the law re
quires, that the two officers selected
from a list of those opposed to the
sale, barter or loan of spirituous, vin
ous or malt liquors, or the persons
there assembled, who opposed the
sale, barter or loan of spirituous,
vinous or malt liquors, or said
officers and said persons there
assembled, acting jointly and in
concert, selected H. A. Power and Roy
Pepper from among those who were
opposed to the sale, barter or loan of
spirituous, vinous or malt liquors, and
that because of this, said election in
Clintonville Precinct No. 2 was illegal,
void and of no effect, and not free and
equal.
The said officers of election allowed
persons who were not qualified, to
vote, and among others, one John
Calloway, who was not of age; that
they refused to allow others who were
qualified to vote, and among
them, Sam Smith and Herbert
Michem and Sol Fields, and 1
contestants say that in said precinct
the election officers refused to count
ten ballots which were voted in favor
of the sale, barter and loan of spirit
uous, vinous and malt liquors.
The contestants for further amend
ment to said ground say that in North
Middletown Precinct No. 1, and in va
rious other precincts in Bourbon Coun
ty, that many who were known to be
in favor of the sale, barter and loan '
of spirituous, vinous and malt liquors,
and who were tenants and raised to-
bacco as a means of supporting them-
selves and their families and those de- alone should n-'t enter a partly filled
pending upon them, were told that if u without others in sight who can
they did not vote dry the "drys," , render assistanCe in case of asphyxi
their landlords, would not raise any ation
tobacco and " that they would be . .
thrown out of employment, and that
many persons were coerced to vote ;
"No" upon said proposition, and con-j
testants say for these reasons the
election was not free and equal.
They come and amend the four
teenth ground of their contest, and for
amendment say that in the various
voting precincts in Bourbon County
the booths were not provided with
curtains as the law requires, and that
the voters did not have an opportu -
nity to vote the secret ballot, as the
law requires, and that the secrecy of
the ballot was thereby destroyed; that
all persons who under the law were
required to present certificates of reg -
istration before voting were not call-
ed upon and compelled to present
their certificates of registration, and
that because of this, said election in
