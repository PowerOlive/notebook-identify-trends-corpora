Scrofula to
Consumption
Any one predisposed to Scrofula can
never be healthy and rigorous This
taint in the blood naturally drifts into
Consumption Being such a deep seated
blood disease Swifts Specific is the
only known cure for Scrofula because
it is the only remedy which can reach
the disease
Scrofula appealed on the head of my little
grandchild when only 18 months old Shortly
after breaking out it spread rapidly all oyer
her body The scabs on the sores would peel
off on the slightest touch and the odor that
would aria aa tne at
mosphere of the room
sickening and unbearable
The disease next attacked
the eyes and we feared she
would lose her sight Em
inent physicians from the
sarroundiag country were
consulted but oould do
nothing to relieve the lit
tle lanooent and gave it
as their opinion that the
t wm VinYMblAOA nd im
possible to save tne cnna s eyesign n w
then that we decided to try Swifts Specific
That medicine at once made a speedy and com
plete cure She is now a young lady and has
Mmr hod a flicrn 01 tne disease to reiuru
Mas Ruth Bkbkklky
Salina Kan
Scrofula is an obstinate blood disease
and is beyond the reach of the average
blood medicine Swifts Specific
SSSrIL Blood
is the only remedy equal to such deep
seated diseases it goes down to the
very foundation and forces out every
taint It is purely vegetable amd is
the only blood remedy guaranteed to
contain no mercury potash or other
mineral substance whatever
