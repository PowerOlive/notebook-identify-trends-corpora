Noted Artist Began Career in
Paris.
The Louisville Timfs of Tuesday
containd the following:
"Paris not Paris, France, but
Paris, Ky.--played an important part
in the career of one of America's best
known portrait painters.Chester Hard
ing, whose portrait of John Randolph
is one of the most treasured posses
sions of American art.
"Throughout Kentucky examples of
the work of the young artist are to be
found, and a Louisville man, in a rem
iniscent mood, was. telling ofhisrecol
lection of the stories extant "when he
was a boy in Paris, Ky., of the work
of Chester Harding, who began his
career as a house painter, wandering
about the country doing odd jobs.
" 'Harding was born in Massa
chusetts,' said the .old Kentuckian.
'but hJ3 family removed when he was
a boy to Western New York State.
Although he began life as a house
painter, he soon found that this did
not satisfy his ambition, consequently
he began to experiment, and found
that he had a certain unexpected abil
ity for portrait painting. This dis
covery was made in Pittsburg, and
from there he went to Paris, Ky.,
where he set up as a portrait painter.
In six months it is said that he did
more than 100 heads, at S25 each, and
throughout the State these portrait
heads are still treasured possessions.
" 'With the money earned in Ken
tucky he made a trip through the
West, painling portraits from place
to place, later returning io his home in
New i.'ork It was then, as he after
ward related to a Kentucky friend,
that his father took him aside and said
to him gently : 'Chester I want to j
spearc io you acout your present mode
of living. I think it is very little bet
ter than swindling to charge $40 for
one of thce effigies. Ndw, 1 want
you to give up- vour present course and
settle clown . farm and become a
respectable l hk'
" 'Fortuna y for American art.
Chester Haro, .g -continued 'painting
effigies,' ' coiiuioded the Louisville
man."
Chester Harding, referred to in the
above, was engaged in business in this
city in connection with his brother,
Roger Harding. He began his career
here and had a studio in the building
on Pleasant street, now occupied by
Mr. and Mrs. Brice Steele. At that
time it was owned and a part occupied
by Mr. Thomas Arnold then Circuit
Clerk cf Bourbon county and the
father o'f James and Col. .Brent Ar
nold, the latter now of Covington.
Several of his lainlirgs are in ex
istence in this section, among them
being the likeness of the partnts of
Mr. Anthony Thornton, and one of
Otho Hushes, postmaster in Paris dur
ing the Civil War and of his wife, Mrs.
Anna Hughes, who was a relative of
Mrs. Laura Perry.

An exchange punts the following:
"Ia the beginning Gcd created Heaven
and bartn, thfn the editor and the!
liberal advertiser which is all good.
The next day it snowed, and Pie creat
ed the man who does not believe in
advertising, another who does not take
the home paper then he rested. Then
the devil got into the moulding rcom
and created the man who takes the
paper for several years and fails to
pay for it, After he had completed
that surry job and had a few lumps
left he created the excuse of a man
who settles his subscription by inform
ing tne postmaster to mark his paper
'refused.' "
