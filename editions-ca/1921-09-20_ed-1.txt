Besides their regulation camp equipage each Scoutcarried a compass, hatchet, pike staff,and blanket roll.A Paris man who has been with acamping party near the scene of theBoy Scouts' hiking place told a goodone on them. It seems that an orderof the day was to search out a party j clarence Kenney 50of Scouts and trail them from oneN F Brenf 50place to another. The leaders hadmarked their trail by dropping grainsof white corn at close intervals. Thetrackers did all right until they cameto a big tree in the center of an opanfield, where the trail vanished. Baffled, they returned and reported toScoutmaster Scott the loss of thetrail. An investigation disclosed thefact that the tree under which thetrail vanished was populated by alarge colony of turkeys, which hadgobbled up the corn as fast as it hadbeen laid, consequently the trail was"a blind one" for the Scouts.COPFEE!

From Paris the highwayleads, to Latonia on a direct line."The bands have a white field, withthe black letters "L L L" in the field.Below,, and above are orange stripes,Under which appears an L or R,which indicates the direction of aturn in the highway when near acurve."

Simms, millionaire turfman and oil magnate and master ofXalapa Farm, in Bourbon County,with John Sanford, the New Yorkturfman, recently made an offer of$400,000 for The Tetrarch, famousEnglish thoroughbred sire, and a fewmares, which they named with him,in the hopes of bringing that celehrated horse to America, to enrichthe racing string of this country,according to reports brought to Kentucky by Eastern horsemen, thi3week.According to a story told by horsemen, one night recently whileSimms and Sanford were at the RitzCarlton Hotel in New York, they.engaged in conversation about horsesand agreed that The Tetrarch oughtto be brought to America. So theycabled an offer of $400,000 for thehorse and a few mares named withhim. It was practically an offer forthe noted sire, but it was not accepted. The Tetrarch is the sire of Polemarch, which recently won the Doncaster St. Legar, the final and distinctive three-year-old test of Britishracing, and of Caligula, which wonthe corresponding event last year.The Tetrarch is owned by Sir HughMcCalmont, who has so far refusedto put a price on the horse, it is said.Mr. Simms some time ago purchased and imported to his Bourbon. County estate those great race horses,Prince Palatine and Negofol, whichnow head his Xalapa Stud.oTHE COUNTY DOCTORMecklenburg county, N. C, whichincludes the city of Charlotte, is nowwithout a single doctor outside thecities and towns. There are fourcounties in Massachusetts now without doctors.There are several explanations forthis. One is changed living conditions, including the building of goodroads and the use of automobiles andtelephones. A physician may live ina city or town, keep a telephone andan automobile, and visit his patientsfor miles around.But the real reason, perhaps, isthat the country doctor, as peopleused to know him, is passing. Thisis a day of specialization, with physicians as well as with everybody else.The general practitioner will soon bea thing of the past. In his stead therewill be specialists in nervous disease,stomach diseases, eye, ear and nosediseases, and so on. Indeed, we havealmost reached that point now.The physican who is not a specialist in some particular disease mustbe at least a diagnostician. He cantell you what is the matter with you,and tell what specialist to consult.The doctor who used to treat all diseases, and with fair success and, ifneed be, furnish .all the medicinesneeded, will soon be known to theworld no more.But we don't know whether theworld will be better off or not.oEnglish Needle Industry.English needles were first made atLong Crendon, Oxfordshire, and afterward at Redditch, while their manufacture was still in the main a homeindustry, different btages being completed in the cottages of the workers,who were generally women. Thencame machinery; fortunes were madesometimes lost in the needle tradeas in every other industry.o"True Blue" and the "Blue Ribbon."The expression true blue is handeddown from the Scotch Covenanters ofthe Seventeenth century, who choseblue as their emblem in opposition tothe royal red. The Covenanters werea group bound by a series of covenantsto uphold the Presbysterian forms anddoctrines of faith. Thus true blue wasapplied originally to a loyal Presbyterian. The blue ribbon, always thereward of the winner in a race or contest, originated in the use of a blueribbon as the distinguishing badge ofthe Knights of the Ganer, an orderfounded by Edward III.o"tife as I See It."My conscience doesn't always prevent me from doing wrong, but itwon't stand in with me.

On the third day ofthe sale, fifty-two lots were disposed,of at 42,385. The average size ofthe lots are 35x125 and rangingfrom $450 to $2,200 each, dependingupon the location."Mt.

Probably eighty per cent, of all diseases originate in the digestive organs. Dys,,'pepsia, or what is more commonly known as indigestion, is not only oneof the most prevalent, but it is one of the most difficult to treat of all present day diseases, and has for years b affled the skill of leading specialistseverywhere..

He discussed the industrial and financialsituation of the world in general andin this country in particular at somelength, and wound up with the following: "But when all is said and done,the best cure for all depression iscourage and applied intelligence andthe return to the primary virtues ofhard, conscientious toil and economyin living. On every side there is evidence that the vast majority of ourwhole nation is making an effortagain in these directions, equaledonly by that of 1918. While our recovery may be slower than some mayexpect, nothing can prevent the prosperity of a country where the people have enlightenment, the wish towork, the wish to produce, and thewish to do right by their neighbors."We are a nation of men, womenand children. Our industrial systemand our commerce are simply instruments for their comfort and happiness. "hen we deal with these greatproblems of business and economicswe must be inspired by the knowledge that we are increasing and defending the standards of living ofour people. Upon this soil grow allthose moral and intellectual forcesthat make our nation great."This is about the most statesmanlike utterance that we have read insome time. It is inspirational.The fact that the resources of thiscountry are so great, and the people' v.0 nnnntrv themselves are sogreat that we will not have any serious business depression for very longat a time.And the more steadfast we are tothe principles of common honesty anddecent living, the more enduring andunassailable will be our prosperity.oYHome Proof, Here, There andEverywhereWhen you see Doan's Kidney Pillsrecommended in this paper you mustalways find the recommender a Parisresident.

S. PLEDGES BTOLEY LOANS, rWASHINGTON, Sept. 16. Financial support from the FederalGovernment in the marketing" of the1921 Burley tobacco crop, throughthe Burley Growers Co-operativeMarketing Association, organizationof which is now nearly completed,was definitely assured Wednesday,following several conterences De- jtween representatives of the preliminary committee of burley growersand Treasury Department officials.Two important results obtainedfrom the cenferences, which, according to the committee representatives,guarantee the successful handling ofthe crop by the association, are:First, definite assurance given bythe War Finance Corporation thatif the burley growers organize under the proposed co-operative marketing plan, the corporation willgive any application made by theassociation the same considerationthat already has been given to similar organization of cotton growers,advances to which have been in excess of 50 per cent of the value ofthe crop.Second, presentation to the Federal Reserve Board of a requestfor a ruling that a grower's drafts onthe association, accompanied byweight tickets, shall be classed asagricultural paper, and indicationsof the officials that a favorable replymay be expected, which would entitle such paper to six months credit,rather than three months allowedcommercial paper.Answers Last CriticismEarly in the afternoon, the delegation representing the tobacco organization held a conference with theBoard of Directors of the War Finance Co-operation, at the conclusionof which confidence was expressedthat the Federal authorities are readyto back the burley co-operative marketing movement, being organized inforty-one counties in Kentucky twoin Ohio and two in indiana, to thesame extent that it has been assistingsimilar organizations of cotton growers. This, it is held by the tobaccogrowers' committee, insures the financial stability of their organizationfrom all criticism.Those representing the marketingassociation at the conferences todaywere :Judge Robert W. Bingham, Louis-i ville, chairman ; James C. Stone, Lexington; William E. Simms, SpringStation; James C. Wilson, Louisville;Charles N. Manning, Lexington, andW. C. Montgomery, EHzabethtown.Statement On ConferenceFollowing the meeting between thisdelegation and the War Finance Corporation Board, Judge Bingham issued the following statement:"The War Finance Corporationheld a conference this morning witha committee representing the marketing co-operative association nowforming to merchandise the Burleytobacco produced in the UnitedStates, and after going over the planof organization, stated to the committee that the board had heretoforeagreed to advance in excess of 50 percent of the value of certain crops,such as cotton, to co-operative marketing organizations formed on theCalifornia plan, this plan being theone adopted by the burley growers,and that if the burley growers organize under this plan and apply tothe board, they may expect the sameconsideration given to similar applications, due regard beine had togeneral conditions, financially andotherwise, and the proper organization and management of the burleygrowers' co-operative association."Kills Doubt Of Success."The War Finance CorporationBoard has assured us that the BurleyGrowers' Co-operative Marketing Association will be given the same consideration that these other groupshave received," said James C. Stone,Lexington, vice chairman of the committee."That is all we could ask for, andin all probability is considerably morethan we shall need. The attitudetaken by the corporation officials removes every possible doubt of thesuccessful financing of the burleygrowers through this association."BUSINESS PAILTJBESR. G. Dunn & Co. report that business failures are declining, Theyhave fallen from 1,895 for the wholecountry in January to 1,2000 in June.The prospects are bright for continued decrease. The note of improvement is beginning to drown out thechorus of alarm.One of the financial experts saysthat many of the failures, although itmay seem unkind to say so, are excellent signs of returning businesssolidity, for they have occurredwhere business had been built uponinflated standards and conductedalong unsound, wasteful lines.This sort of business is graduallydisappearing, as it should. The firmswhich weather the depression will beof the type entitled to endure because their methods are sound andrepresent real serviqe to the public inreturn for the profits reaped.In the meantime deflation goesrapidly on. It is said, by those in aposition to know, to have traveled asfar in one year since the world waras it took several years to cover afterthe civil war.It is a rather painful process, tobe sure, but maybe it will mean thatthe return to normal business conditions will be all the more rapid. Itwill do no harm to hope for it, and toplan for it, at any rate.oThe Time May Come."Dig world is gineter be all rights-said Uncle Eben, "jes' as soon as dcrowd cheers a-kind word or a geo?trous action de same as it does ahome run."oNorway has no leee than 8,0001motor Vehicles.
