GiotmersiT Buildingmits.Without Perwmmfw9mmmwThe City Council at its regularmeeting last night placed a ban on theerection of buildings within the citylimits without first securing a permitfrom the council, and in the lutureviola ors of the provisions of this3 lawwill be punished in the citv couir. tBuilding without permits, acccidingto the opinion of a number of the mem-1bers of the Board has been going on junmolested or several years, and has ,affected the insurance rates of a num-jber of property holders in the ' city.Complaints have been received in ,great numbers, resulting in the council issuing a strict order that the 'awmust be obeyed to the letter. Hereafter breaking ground for foundationsor any movement toward thegerectionof a building must be preceded by apermit issued by the council.The action ot the council grew out ofthe complaint made to the erectionof a small stable in the rear of theproperty occupied Dy J. W. Bramblettjon High street and the fact that Mr.VV. C. Dodsori, a member of the firm ofDodsdn & Denton, without securing apermit erected a stable on his property on South Main street. The closeproximity of this building to the property ot Mr. Hooker Stivers caused theinsurance companies iholding risks toincrease the rate of insurance uponthe buildings art the latter. ;This was bought to the notice ofthe council in a letter to Mr. Stiversfrom the insurance company advisinghim to this effect. The buildings' otMr. Bramblett; and Mr. Dodton wereo-dered removed.The fact that the council overlookedthe matter of pacsing upon the seventeen applications for saloon licenses, itwas taken up at the meeting and without objection the applications werevoted upon as a whole and granted.A report wa3 made by CouncilmanHinton in regard to the payment ofsalaries of two colored "jnen employedby the city, and which was btoughtup at the last meeting of the councilby Councilman Kenney, was acceptedby the Board, who allowed the claimsof the men. The payment of the salaries was heldjup at the instance ofMayor Hinton, who ordered an investigation into the reports jpf Street Superintendent John Cain, together withthe time the men had been employedin other capacities. These, accordingto the report of Councilman Hintoncorresponded with the records.Councilman iJarrish, as Chairmanof the Fire committee, was instructed to have the Paris Water ' Companyinstall two additional fire hydrants,one at the corner of Sixteenth andHigh and another at the corner otNineteenth and Brent strees. Mr.Parrish reported the work on thesewer now under construction onWest Eightli street progressing rapidly.aml with its completion the construction of the 3ewer ordered bv thecouncil for Mt. Airytwill begin.A petition from the trustees ofNorth Middletown was nresented tothe Board, in which it was asked thatone tank of oil foi use on the streetsin that place be sold to them and requested the sprinkler used for the purpose ot sprinkling the oil be loanedthem. As soon as the work of spreading oil in this city is completed therequest of the Trustees will kbegranted.The matter of making an iappropri-ation for the maintenance of the Mas- uSsie Memorial Hospital was brought .up,but upon a motion of Councilman Hinton. action was deferred until t Jhefiling of the report of the Ctiy Assessor, wnen it dp aeterminea me aniountthe city will be able to contribute tothe support of this intsitutioh.' Mr.Hinton said he had conferred with thetrustees who had stated this coiiisewould be entirely satisfactory in'viewof the fact that the FiscalfrjComt ofBourdon had already madejan appropriation, which would beample tq,spstain them in their work un$l jihefcpuncil could take some actiorat4 Jtsnextregular meeting. n IofoMayor Hinton named "Messrs.

Next to these the lowestIn mortality was the wet-mash flock.Chicks reared on skimmed milkmash made a most rapid growth forthe first three- weeks. The chicksreared on powdered-milk mash madethe greatest growth in six weeks.Chicks having the variety rationmade, during the fifth- week, the greatest weekly, gain of the experiment.Chicks having the wet mash and thevariety rations made better growththan .those having dry mash orcracked grain.Chicks having dry mash made theleast 'gain in weight pen chick, atgreatest cost per pound.The wet mash and the variety ration flocks ate 'less per pound weight,Feeding Trough for Mash.and at Jess cost per pound weight thanthe flock having the dry rations.Dry feeding cost less for labor per100 chicks than the wet mash.The variety Tation cost more forlabor per 100 chicks for the first threeweeks, but cost less than the wetmash for six weeks.Considering the number of chicksreared, the vigor of the chicks, andthe continued palatability of the ration, the variety ration gave the bestresults' f or -the first Bix weeks.- In total weight' ok flopk averagevreighpjii chicks, rapid 'growth ant"development, goat per pound gain andper pound weight, the wet-mash powdered-milk ration gave the best resuits.MHwimWrninwiinuilfflmMHIHDon t Look WtpntionOld BeforeY&wt TimeThat backache, so common rir-ng romen, brings with it the sunken chest, theheadache, tired mucle cro-v's-feet, and soon the youthful botfy is no more youthful in appearance and all because of lack of attention.There is no reason why you should b? so unfortunate, when you have at yourdisposal a remedy Such as Dr. Pierce's Favorite Proscriptionrecommendedfor over 40 years as a remedy for ailments peculiar to women.

Three parts of corn,one part of shorts, and one-third ofa part of oil meal or one-sixth of apart of tankage, with skim milk, ifavailable, makes a splendid ration forboth boar and sows. He should begiven a lot to himself, or with barrows, where he can secure plenty ofexercise and yet not bother the sows.;,If it is necessary to buy a boar, thisshould be done at least three weeksbefore the breeding season, and thenewly purchased animal kept by himself. This is simply a precaution toavoid introducing lice and possiblydisease into the herd. While beingkept by himself the boar should bethoroughly washed -with dip every tendays.FOR CREAM-STre33HP-:Become a Tri-State Shipper to-day for Shipoinsr dream frr (hoTi;.ci-3i-A ?... - .cinnati, Ohio, is .

Thereare several methods of doing this, ofwhich perhaps the best consists ofmaking notches in the ears and having each notch represent a definitenumber.rBy means of the following methoda's many as a hundred litters may bemarked -with not to exceed fournotches in the ears of each pig. Forexample: Let a notch on the loweredge of the left ear represent No. 1;on the same edge near the tip, No. 10;on the upper edge of the same earnear the tip, No. 20, On the rightear, lower edge near the head, let thenotch lepresent No. 3; and on thesame edge near the .tip, No. 30; onthe upper edge of the same ear, No.5; and on the same edge near the tip.No. 'SO. This system is easy to remember. All you have to keep inmind is that No. 1 is on the left earnear tho head and No. 5 just above itMarking Young Pigs.on the upper edge, and that on theright ear No. 3 is on the lower edgenear the head and No. 5 is just aboveit on the upper edge. Near the tipsthe numbers are just ten times aslarge as those near the head.Each pig of litter No. 1 should havethe notch on the' upper edge of thesame ear, those of number threeshould have the notch on the loweredge of the right ear near the' head,those of No. 4 should have a notch onthe lower edge of both ears near thehead. By following this system anynumber of combinations of thesenumbers may be made up to 100.By studying the illustration onemay get a good idea of this method ofmarking. The key head shows themethod already described, while theother three figures show how the earsare marked for ltiters 5, 17 and 41.Each year the litters should be numbered in the order of their birth, eachpig In the litter being given the samemarking. Always record the litteridentification marks in a book keptexclusively for the purpose.Treatment for 'Scours.Good success was attained at theSouth Carolina station in treatingcalves affected with scours by addingformalin to the milk at the rate ofone part to four thousand. Elevencalves out of twleve treated recoveredwithout any further attention, sevenon the second day, three on the thirdand one on the ninth. The calves wereyoung ones fed chiefly on skimmilk.Live Stockcwct NotesAlways use a thoroughbred boar.Winter shoeing should be most carefully done.There never was a better time thannow to start in sheep.Epidemics among hogs are moreeasily prevented than cured.The novice should start with a few-first-classewes, never any culls.Fatten the rattle-headed sow thatis hard to handle at pigging time.Whoever heard of a horse gettingthrush if his stable and feet were keptclean?Wheat middling and barley are fineas a feed for growing pigs or fattening hogs.In all cases where perfect cleanliness has been enforced there hasbeen no disease.Fancy and well conditioned lambsare tne ones tnat bring home themoney from -any, market..Meats are .high the world over, andlamb and mutton more in demand byconsumers than ever before.- Planning to be right on hand andaerye every pig may mean many dollars to you at farrowing time.With lamb chops selling at twentyfive cents a pound in the markets,there is surely "something in sheep."When the pigs begin to eat theybecome almost self ) supporting andare demanding less rind less of thesow. 1.

This seems to be inevitable, owing to'the higher state ofsociety. In a general way the morehighly developed an animal is thelonger an apprenticeship it will havto serve before it is ready to cut loosefrom parental and other restraints andshift for itself.Two interesting books have recently,been brought out, which treat of thismatter in infancy as applied to the various animals. The period of infancyvaries very widely. Mice have practically no infancy, but at jsix weeks areparents of more mice. Human beingsare helpless at birth and for yearsafter. The horse is "grown, up" atthree years, while the elephant requires seven or eight times that lengthof ime to develop fully. Thus the"elephant is just entering upon lifewhen the horse Is ready to die of oldage.In a general way, says the .Pathfinder, the length of infancy tends torun parallel with the relative bulk ofthe animal the larger animals requiring more time to grow and develop their full vigor. In some cases lower animals attain maturity only by asuccession of curious stages. The shellof a crab when once hardened cannotgrow and the crdb is forced to molt orcast off his outgrown shell from timeto time and grow a new one a littlelarger.A crab when growing this new shellis known as soft shell or "soft" crab,and at such times he' is, of course, especially subject to attack from hisenemies, as the shell, w hich is the natural armor, is wanting. In museumsthere are exhibits of as many as fourteen castoff shells of a single crab, beginning with a very tiny one and eachone just a size larger than the last.Shellfish have their skeletons outside them in the form of their shellsinstead of inside them. But what awaste of material is involved in a system which requires them to manufacture a new skeleton every new moonor at other short intervals, only to bethrown away as soon as it is finishedThe state of development of animals when born depends a great dealon the conditions that are to surroundthem during infancy. Young rabbits,which are born in an undergroundburrow, are blind, naked and helplessat birth ; the young hare, which is owncousin to the rabbit, is born with itseyes open and covered with fur, andthis because it is born above ground,where it is exposed both to the inclemency of the weather and predatoryfoes. Thus in a measure eacli is suited to its surroundings.Latest About David.A London teacher who has beenexamining the papers sent in by boysof ten or eleven for a Scripture examination sends a few of the choicestefforts :One day David saw ten leppards,and they were calling out unclean.One of them turned back and startedto come towards him and he wasclean. ?A Pharisee and a publiccon wentup into a temple to pray. One likedit, the other did not, so one stopedand the other didn't. This teaches usto be kind and not unkind.A .giant named Goliath, the manof the Phyistins, was going to fightIsrainel. A young boy name dlvidherd him. He said to himself, "I'llhave a go at him." He went to theIsraelite' camp. He said, "I'll have ago at him."The Pharisees are frods and donotkeep' the law. The Publicans are thetax corlectors. They do not take whatthey haft too. They made 'thereselves more money. That learns uanot to thief.Expensive Boat Race.A writer in Bailey's Magazine oiEngland has been figuring on the costof the annual boat race between Oxford and Cambridge, and says the expense to each crew may be approximately estimated at $3,000 for each.He then says that as the contest rarely takes more than twenty minutes,the cost works out at about $300 perminute, or about $8 every time theoars' dip into the water. The cost ofthe boats is placed at $250, and theoars at $70, the rest of the money going for preparation from October -untilthe day of the race. The writerseems to think that $3,000 is a gooddeal of money to spend on a collegecrew (observes the New York Evening Post). It would be interestingto know what he would think of manytimes that amount spent upon theAmerican college crews for the annual races.; Literary Evening. jThe man was one of the sort "thatthinks it is a grand thing to educatehis financee by reading poetry loudto her.TJhe girl was one of the. sort wellshe was a girl.
