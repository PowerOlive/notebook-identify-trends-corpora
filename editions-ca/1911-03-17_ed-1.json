The official Government tests
show Royal Baking Powder to be
an absolutely pure and healthful
grape cream of tartar baking

other brand in its place.
With no other agent can bis
cuit, cake and hot-breads be made
so pure, healthful and delicious,
Royal Baking Powder costs only a fair price per pound,
and is cheaper and better at its price than any other baking
powder in the world. It makes pure, clean, healthful food.
