See ,B. T. BISHOP or J. H. FLORAFRIDAY, JANUARY 16. 1920.- THE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS,. KENTUCKYPAGE THREE$LACK OF HORSESIS MOST SERIOUSPRODUCTION OF THOROUGH-BREDS MUST BE EN-COURAGED.PRESENT SUPPLY IS SHORTArmy Would Need One Animal forEvery Two Men- Should We BeCalled Upon to Engage inMilitary Operation forAny Reason.Some idea of the magnitude of thetask of the Remount Board of theUnited States army In organizing anumaintaining a horse breeding andsupply scheme for the future forcesof national defense may be had by astudy of the reports of the remouiuofficers of the A. E. F., for the periodof 1917-1918. It was found in Francethat Uie old theory that the proposition of horse strength to manstrength in armies should be two tofive was erroneous. One horse forevery two men was needed. To theirastonishment the officers of the remount service, many of whom hadnever seen the inside of a militarytext book until a few weeks beforethey received their commissions, discovered th'af six hundred horses wererequired to equip a single infantryregiment of war strength, that is aregiment of 3G00 to 3S00 men.It was next to impossible to obtainhorses in sufficient numbers toproperly equip even the artillery,transport and ambulance services ofthe A. E. F., because for a period oftwo- years before the participation ofthe United States in the conflict theentente allies had been draining thecountry of horses of all sorts andkinds. The A. E. F. had no cavalry.' Modern Armies Are Large.Nowadays armies are reckoned by.hundreds of, thousands, if not bymillions. The strength of a singledivision of the A. E. F., was greaterIn men and horses than the biggestarmy commanded by Stonewall Jackson in his entire career. The combined armies of Lee and Meade thattook part In the struggle of Gettysburg could have done no more in thetitanic i-ontlict that terminated lastNovember than' hold two-score ofmiles of the western front. If theUnited States were called to arms,whether to defend some interest.peculiarly our own or to fulfill -iLeague of Nations obligation, themobilization of from 500,000 to 1,000,000 soldiers might be necessary. If.the old theory that the correct pro-iportion of horse strength to man:strength In armies was still accepted'by military opinion, 200,000 horseswould be required for the outfitting ofhalf a million soldiers, 400,000 for theoutfitting of a force of 1,000,000 and,if an army of half a million or amillion soldiers had to be kept in thefield in a state of military efficiencya reserve- of 400,000 to 800,000 wouldbe necessary. If the future militaryforces of the United States are to beoutfitted with horses on a one to twobasis with adequate reserves, andsuch a scheme of outfitting would benecessary if the armies of the UnitedStates were to attempt interventionIn Mexico to protect American or'European interests in the maintenanceof the Monroe Doctrine, it will be"necessary to provide an lmmedlatsmobilization force of from 250,000 to500,000 with reserves equally strong.f Today the United States could notproperly outfit with horses an arrayof 100,000 soldiers. There are horse-?In the country, many of them. But;they are mostly draught horses Normans, Percherons, Clydesdales, Belgians, Shires, etc. whose military usefulness is limited to the dragging ofheavy artillery. Horses , of thretypes are not In the least serviceableto a mobile army, or an army offflaneuver, as the new phrase describes an army that must performmarches of fifteen to twenty miles uday or retreat quickly if strategy suggests ra-treat. They are too sluggish,t6 lacking in spirit. The horses that'are wanted are the light types and ofthese there are so few the aggregate,may properly be said to be anegligible quantity in any practical jjscheine of national defense. The gasoline niotor long since made the pro.(taction of this type of horse unnrofitable. Farmers and stockmen'have ceased to raise light horse in jconsiderable numbers. Tne creation oia new supply must be stimulated bythe United States government, butnothing the government 'could dowould suffice if there w&s any interference with the production ofthoroughbred sftf&Bons. Stallions ofthe thoroughbred types are indispenslble because the offspring of suchstallions, whether from mares oftborongh'bred blood or from mares ofUO particular breeding, proved bestIn a half century of experimentationconducted in Europe by the greatmilitary powers before the outbreakof the war of nations and the halfand three-quarter bred outstayed andoutgamed the representatives of thecolder breeds under the hard conditions of actual warfare, between1914 and 1918.Light Horse Not Raised.Since It is no longer 'profitable forfarmers and stockmen to raise lightharness horses for the market officerof the military service .who bftRun-Down, NervousWomenLouisville, Ky.: "Last year I becameterribly run-down and nervous and had thesymptoms peculiarto women of my age.Three bottles of Dr.Pierce's FavoritePrescription so completely strengthenedand built me up that1 felt like a differentwoman; my nervesgave me no furthertrouble and I feltbetter in every way.'Favorite Prescription' can be reliedupon to relieve everyfivmntnm nf fumininaweakness and I take great pleasure inrecommending it to all women who aretoss ? srags8-0LIVEEIN MIDDLE-LIFESt. Matthew, Ky. : "I suffered with such?am ?ZeT my shouIder blades at night thatI could hardly turn over from one side ontothe other that was during the 'change',I also had heat flashes and functional disturbance.

This iswhy so pnany druggists use and recommend Chamberlain's CoughRemedy. J. B. Jones, a well knownlrugglst of Cuburn, Ky., says, "Ihave used Chamberlain's CoughRemedy in jmy family for the pastseven years, and have found it to bethe best cough medicine I have everknown."(adv-jan)studied the problem of military horsesupply most deeply have declared inrecommendations to the general staffat Washington and to congress thatthe government must obtain andplace at the disposal of farmers insections of the country in which horsesmay be raised most economically between 4000 and S000 thoroughbredstallions. A beginning has been madein this tremendous work, but no morethan a beginning. The remountservice has placed in Virginia, NewYork, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas anain the far west some seventy-five oreighty thoroughbred stallions, andthese stallions have, almost withoutexception, been the cheerful gifts ofthoroughbred producers and personinterested in racing.It is because of the government':'insurmountable need of thoroughbredblood that the most distinguishedofficers of the regular military servicehave been so outspoken in theiropposition to half baked legislationthat might interfere with thoroughbred production. Major-GeneralLeonard Wood was the first officer ofhigh rank to declare himself publiclyon this subject. In 1911 whenthoroughbred stallions and mares bythe hundreds were being shipped outof the country because the shuttingdown of racing in New York state inconsequences of the Hughes anti-racinglegislation of 1908 and 1910closed the metropolitan market tothoroughbred producers, General Woodannounced in the daily press that the jins nf thnroucrhbred blood had OS-,l ..... -...-... f ... e n ,i-t,..r.1 jfrUimiii tue yruyuniuua ui a uauumucalamity, and that if something werejnot done by the government to th'ecltthe exportation of such stock and torevive production it would be imposible to properly outfit with horsesan army of the size the United Stateswould have to pu't in the field -if wecame in conflict "with a first-classpower. The prophesy of GeneralWood was to be abundantly fulfilledin 1917 and 1918 ns had already beenpointed out.Oppose Anti-Racing Laws. iWhen the hearings on the anti-racingbills in Maryland's legislaturewere held a year ago last winterwere on General Andrew Hero, commander of the Artillery Brigade ofthe Division of draught troops thatwas training at Camp Meade, andColonel Raymond Briggs, of the 311tlifield artillery, who afterwards became brigadier-general because of hisflisHmruhshed service in the field,appeared before the judicial proceedings committee of the senate and protested against legislative interference with thoroughbred production.Major-General Kuhn and- Brigadier"General Nicholson, respectively, commander and second in command ofthe Camp Meade Division, were unable on account of "business to appearbefore the hRitse judiciary committeeat the last hearing, ,hut theyauthorized representative speakersagaiust the pending legislation in theirnames.

"I had fallen off until I was almost 'skin and bones' and mystrength and energy were slowlyleaving me. I had a dread of thefuture and could see nothing but theoperating table and the knife. I hada perfect horror of an operation, butmade up jmy mind that it was eitherlife or death and prepared to submit to it. I had made all preparations for the operation and called onmy sister to tell her goodbye, as Idid not know whether I would liveto see her again or not. My sisterbegged and pleaded with me not toallow them to cut on me and told,me to wait and try a good tonic fora while. The next day as I returnedfrom the consultation room Ithought of what she said, and as Ihad heard so much about Tanlac, Idecided to trywi as a last resort, andstopped at the drug store and got abottle. Of course, I had lost heartand had no faith in medicine, but toplease my sister, I made up myjmind to take it, and oh, what ahappy day that was for me!"I never returned for the operation, but just kept taking Tanlac i j tailQ my nillJiuvemeut. iino uccn ijwrapid that none of my clothes fit me.Right from the start I began to improve. The medicine seemed "totake hold right at once. It had asoothinsr effect, and in a few days Ifelt no pain at all. I was so happy jover my wonderful improvementthat I sent for my neighbors to tellthejm how much better I felt. I sentand got another bottle of Tanlacand have just finished my third andfeel like I have been made overagain into a new woman."As I have said before, I nowweigh one hundred and twenty-fivepounds and none of my clothes arebig enough for me, and I will haveto make them over again. I nowhave a ravenous appetite and myhusband says I am simply eatinghim out of house and home. I haveeven gone back to my coffee,which I was told not to touch.Those horrible pains in my back andhead all disappeared and I sleep likea child. I am no longer nervous,and when I get up in the mornings1 1 feel refreshed, cheerful and bngnt.I am now able to attend to myhousework again and I feel as if Ihad started life all over. My husband is highly delighted and my recovery is the talk of the neighborhood. I do nothing but rejoice allday long over the recovery of myheaith and praise Tanlac to everybody. "I feel so grateful for my escapefrom the operating table and theknife that you may publish what Ihave said; you jmay if you wish,tell other women suffering as I wasto come and see me and I will beglad to tell them about my case."Tanlac is sold in Paris by thePeoples' Pharmacy.
