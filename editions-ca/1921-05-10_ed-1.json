MATRIMONIAL.
"HY OLD KENTUCKY HOME."
Every Kentuckian should be glad
-of a chance to contribute to the fund
to purchase "Federal Hill," the old
Rowan -homestead near Bardstown,
where Stephen Foster wrote "My Old
Kentucky Home." as a memorial to
the author of the most appealing1,
State song ever written. Tardy 1
recognition has been given the com- j
poser, and the movement to buy
"Federal Hill" and make it a Ken
tucky shrine is a most worthy one. ;
The Foster masterpiece was a work
of inspiration. It shares with
"Dixie" the honor of international
fame. It is on the programs of the
-celebrated European orchestras, and
it is in the repertory of every great
singer. Nothing has made the world
better acquainted with the grand old
-commonwealth, und now that the op
portunity is to be presented for Ken
tuckians to pay tribute to the mem
ory of Stephen Foster the response
-should be prompt and generous.
THE NEWS will be gjad to receive
checks from those who desire to con
tribute. Checks will be duly ac
knowledged in this paper, and for
warded to the Commissioners having
the purchase in charge. Checks
should be made payable to "Old
Kentucky Home Commission."

The Baptist Sunday School ob
served -."Mother's Day" with an in
teresting program, and an attend-
'ance of 605.
; "Mothers' Day" was obseryed at
all the; Paris' churches Sunday with
beautiful services commemorative of
the occasion.
The. Anne Hazeldine Circle W.
M. U. Baptist church, will meet with
the leader, Mrs. W. O. Hinton, this
(Tuesday) afternoon at 3 o'clock!
Full attendance is desired as this is
the first meeting of the new year.
All the : members of the Chris
tian Endeavdr- Society of the Presby
terian church are urged to be pres-
!ent to-morrow (Wednesday) nignt
jat 7:30 oclQck, to 1 hear the address
by Clarence ;s. Hapniiton, or tne
United . Society' of Christian En
deavor. Refreshments will be serv
ed. This should prove an evening of
enjoyment fori all wfco attend.
Rev. J.T.' Sharrard occupied
the pulpit at the Christian church,
Sunday evening, the regular pastor,
Rev. W. E. Ellis, having left in the
afternoon for Springfield, 111., to at
tend the Congress which is in ses
sion at that place. The male chorus
furnished the music '.for the evening
and the special numbers, "All This
Night My Heart Rejoices" and
"Drifting" were very much enjoyed
by a very appreciative audience.
Many expressed the hope that Mr.
Boatright would give the public the
Pleasure of hearing the Male Chorus
pnore frequently. The subject of
Rev. Sharrard's discourse was very
unusual, "The Ground Hog' It was
also very interesting and taught us
that if our faith was as it should
be that we would not be easily
frightened by shadows. There was
one addition at the morning service
and two at the evening. Preparations
are going forward for the Kellums
revival, which begins at the morning
service, Sunday, May 15th. Mr.
Richards conducts the singing. Ser
vices will be held every evening
from then until further notice. Come
early and get a good seat. There is
nothing sensational about the Rev.
Kellums, but at the same time, this
is expected to be the greatest re
vival Paris has had since the Ham
Ramsey meeting. The Board of Offi
cers will have charge of the prayer
meeting services Wednesday evening.
Every one is invited to attend. A
very profitable evening is expected.
