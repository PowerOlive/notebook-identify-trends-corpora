THEATRICAL.
"A BACHELOR'S HONEYMOON."
Nowadays melodrama, taken univer
sally, although, perhaps unfairly as a
whole, does not make good with -the
general public. The average theatre
goer will no longer stand for the mort
gage stealing plot, with the proverbial
mother-in-law furnishing all the
comedy, and half a dozen blue, bloody
murders thrown in for the climaxes.
Shakespeare is still holding down
the boards, but the high class verdict
of the appreciative few is overwhelm
ed by the opinion of the groundlings
and gallery gods, who voice their
sentiments with such expressive re
marks as "Giton t' de Ioidy's araonia,"
'Poipe de guy wid de 'marcel wave'."
All of which of course tends to stimu
late the spirits of the struggling Thes
pian. Today is the day of the "problem
play." Just what a "problem play"
is is still a problem. But when the
climax is reached in a suicidal shot,
which, although you have been expect
ing it for the last ten minutes shatters
to smitherines any idea you may have
had in regard to the author's inten
tions, when you rise from your seat,
put on your hat, forgetting to assist
your partner with her opera cloak, and
wander from the theatre with a
dreamy mist before your eyes and a
dark brown taste in your mouth, its
the one best bet that the current bill
is what they call a "proolem play."
The question is what kind of a play
will satisfy every ticket buyer who
passes the door, as well as that fortu
nate, critical few, who are lucky
enough to come in on paper. Messrs.
Gidson & Bradfield have attempted to
anwser that question by the rejuvena
tion of that great Heyt comedy suc
cess, "A Bachelor's Honeymoon"
which is to be presented at lha Fans
Grand on Tuesday, December 12, and
we believe they have succeeded.
