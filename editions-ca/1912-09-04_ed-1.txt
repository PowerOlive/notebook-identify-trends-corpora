Meat.The Live Stock Record sums up thehigh cost of meat as follows: "Theprincipal cause "f the high price ofmeat is tne decided shortage of thelive stock supplv ; it amounts to millions of animals, while consumers continue to increase. This brings the problem down to the simple proposition of'supply and demand,' and no amount ofabuse heaped upon.,the packers for taking good Drofits or upon farmers forsecuring good prices can be Texpectedto bring relief to theconsumer, now orin the future. Our "observations andinquiries lead us to the conclusion thatwe may look for an indefinite period ofhigh levels in meat prices for the reason that the greatest bulk of live stockwhich the market demands must beDroduced on land worth $50 an acre andupward, because in the average rangesection it requires ten acres to supporta one thousand pound steer fivemonths ; in some sections it requirestwentymo thirty acres, and at the present price of land in the range countrvit is"quite as cheap to pasture stock ongood farm land worth $100 an acre, andmuch cheaper, if fertility is such thatthe steer may be maintained sevenmonths on an acre and a half."Arriving Daily.New Fall Footwear arriving daily atx FELD'S SHOE STORE.Celery and Head Lettuce.We have plenty of both.1-t C.
