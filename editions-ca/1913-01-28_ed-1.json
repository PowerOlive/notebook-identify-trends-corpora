AMUSEMENTS.
Coming to the Paris Grand, Febru
ary 1st, with Miss Millie Beland, and
an excellent company of artists in the
great Western play, "A Western
Girl," with concert band and orches
tra. The play is built distinctly on
comedy lines and there is almost con
tinuous laughter from beg-inning to
end. It is a well written comedy with
an interesting plot and the story told
is a happy blending of sunshine and
shadows. During the action of the
play many pleasing specialties are in
troduced and the little 'details in the
stage settings are so pefect that the
audience gradually enters into the
spirit of the situation and forgets the
theatre. The piece is handsomely
staged with scenery all new and
bright.
It is a genuine pleasure to notethat
"The Bohemian Girl" will be present
ed here shortly by the Aborn Opera
Company. Organizations engaged in
the presentation of the operas of the
Balfe class deserve substantial sun
port of all discriminating patrons of
the theatre.

Very Human Wish.
Merta was five years old, and she
had been told so many times that she
was a big girl now and must be good
that her very soul had sickened. "I
don't want to be five years old any
longer," she grumbled. "I'm tired of
being five and good enough to kill
you. I'd rather stay four and be just
medium and have a good time."

Kitten -in Revolt.
A remarkable case of filial ingrati
tude on the part of a black kitten has
occurred in Liverpool, England. A
few days ago a customer threw a
piece of meat between them, which
was secured by the mother cat. To
the surprise of everybody, the kitten
sprang at his mother and drove her
out of the house. Sincethen he has
mounted guard over the doors to pre
vent her return, and, although she
has attempted time after time to re
turn to her old home, her stern, un
bending, and ungrateful son bars the
way.
Mrs. A. R.JTabor, 'of Crider, Mo.,
had been troubled with sick headache
for about five years, when she began
taking Chamberlain's Tablets. She
has taken two bottles of them and
they have cured her. Sick headache is
caused by a disordered stomach for
which these tablets are especially in
tended. Try ihem, get well and stay
well. Sold by all dealers.
Ocean Denizens.
According to Sir John Murray, one
of the greatest authorities on ocean
ography, the bottom is a desert of
pitch-black darkness, penetrating cold,
and eternal silence. Worms, sea
puddings, and coral polyps sluggishly
crawl or sway in the almost current
less depths, and only two species of
fish, both of them, with much head
and little body, have been found
deeper than a mile and a quarter
down.
Here is a remedy that will cure your
cold. Why waste time and mrney ex
Deriraenting when you can get a prep
aration that has won a world wide rep
utation by its cures of this disease and
can always be deDended upon. It is
knon everywhere as Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy, and is a medicine of
real merit. For salefby all dealers.
Dust Laying in England.
The highway department of the city
of Leeds, England, has recently treat
ed portions of a macadam roadway
with granular calcium chloride to
combat the dust. Solutions of the lat
ter had previously been tried at
greater cost and without such satis
factory results. The road is first well
swept and two applications of the
chloride are made on succeeding eve
nings of about one-half pound per
yard.

Simplify the Problem of Living.
I do believe in simplicity. It Is as
tonishing as well as sad, how many
trival affairs even the wisest man
thinks he must attend to in a day;
how singular an affair he thinks he
must omit. When the mathematician
would solve a difficult problem, he
first frees the equation of all incum
brances, and reduces it to its simplest
terms. So simplify the problem of
life, distinguish the necessary and
the real Thoreau "Letters."
Origin of FaVnous Phrase.
"Write like an angel" is a corruption
of Angelo. Among the Greeks who
emigrated to Italy and afterwards in
to France in the reign of Francis I
was one Angelo Verjecto, whose writ
ing excited the admiration of the
learned, so that his name became
synonymous for the beautiful writ
ing and gave birth to the phrase, to
"write like an angel."
