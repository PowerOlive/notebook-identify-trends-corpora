A Jefferson county resident's home wasraided and the dry officers discovered a private still "which evidently had not been used for some time,as there was no evidence of mash orwhisky."According to a statement in anarticle in a recent number of theLiterary Digest the mountains weighless than the valleys. Which reminds us of the Paris girl who suggested that a spare tire should beheavy, since it has a hundred poundsof air in it.PERSONALSThese sudden changes, blowinghot and cold, creates the most dangerous weather we have so be -verycareful, says a Paris physician. Don'tthink because a day happens to bebright and clear, that you can layaside your wraps. Old Man Pneumonia is standing just around thecorner, waiting for you; the undertaker is flirting with your bank roll;the grave is yawning for a victim,and the shades of departed ones aresaying: "There's another wise guycoming for a long, long stay."I am told that a good many Parispeople are eating bran. , Dry fodder,I would call it. j Not so very long5S5L..the jerr. .same people- weredrinking mineral oil fo their,lieaicn. iiran seejsas to work aboutthe same on the alimentary aystenrof human beings as what farmerscall "roughage does on that of animate, and the same rule holds true Jthe less exercise the more "roughage." The man orr woman who putsin several hours daily in strenuousexercise does not need to worry overbran or mineral oil, but for thosewho lead sedentary lives both doubtless have their value.
