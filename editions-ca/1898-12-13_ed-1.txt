HEALTH AND ORDERBen Henry Military Governor of PortoUsee Issues Instructions to theMayors of Cities and TownsSan Juan de Porto Rico Dec 10Gen Guy V Henry military governorof the department of Porto Rico in aseries of letters to the council givesfurther details of the policy whichthe mayors are urged to maintainin the interest of public health andorderHe points out that their responsibilities have increased with the increaseof their field of action No person isto be imprisoned without specificcharges being preferred all personsnow in prison without such chargesagainst them are to be freed customsdutie3 and money values mustbe regulated by the United States congress but thetowns are to be improved by the adoption of American- standards with aview of educating the people in patriotism and self reliance resort to militarypower is to be had only when absolutely necessary and soldiers who donot respect the civil authorities are tobe severely dealt with Gen Henryappeals to Porto Ricans to smothertheir political differences and to unitein behalf of their countryIn a second letter the military governor saysI am anxious to have the peoplefeel that they can be directly reresented here for the purpose of complaintsgrievances and recommendations Atpresent there seems to be a feeling thatthe island is ruled by one man powerwhich is a relic of the Spanishsystem I desire to learn so far aspossible the views of the people andI therefore instruct the council to inform the mayors that they may sendhere on or before December 19 two delegates from each mayoralty one liberal and one radical to be chosen bythe respective municipal councilsIn the case of a town where the twopolitical parties do not exist or whereone does not its mayor and councilmay choose non partisans in their bestdiscretion The object is to enable meto come into direct contact with thepeople I reserve to myself absolute right to act as I seefit on the recommendations of suchdelegates and shall not be influencedregarding them by men now in officeI shall listen to the voice of the peoplethrough their delegates and shall examine and consider what they lay before me particularly the complaintthat an unnecessary number of officers are now connected with the various councilsThese letters are to be generallypublished and a copy of the second isbeing sent to all post commanders whowill report as to cases where properdelegates are not sentIt being evident that the civilcourts can not -or will not actwith sufficient promptness againstbandits firebugs and murderersthere not yet having been a single conviction for either of theseoffenses though many have been committed an immediate example is necessary and Gen Henry has appointeda military commission to try cases ofthis character when properly presentedHis activity in these various directions is universally commendedTHE OCCUPATION OF HAVANAIntended the First Appearance of UnitedStates Troops Shall Have An Impressive EfTtct on the

Bill CalledWashington Dec 12 The courseof proceedings in the senate this weekwill depend upon the disposition thatis made of the Nicaragua canal billIt is Senator Morgans intention tocall up this measure Monday and hehas expressed the hope that he willsecure action at the Monday sessionFew of his most sanguine co workersagree with him in this opinionand the best indication is thatunless an agreement can be reachedfor postponement several days at leastwill be consumed in its considerationThe opponents of the measure willmeet its supporters with a propositionto defer consideration until after theChristmas holidays and theywill give as their reason forthis request the fact that thereport of the government commissionappointed to investigate the feasibilityof the canal has not yet been madeurging the importance of receiving theinformation which the commissionwill be able to furnish before actingupon so important a question If thebill is taken up in earnest it will consume the greater portion of the senates time until finally disposed ofAnother subject on the calendar isthe anti scalping bill which SenatorCullom has informed the senate he willseek to get up at an early day but hewill meet with opposition if he makesthe effort and is not likely to succeed ithus early in the sessionThe special order for Monday at 2oclock is the bill providing for theregistry of foreign built ships but ifthe Nicaragua bill should be taken upthe registry bill would not be allowedto consume much time Senator Morrill has given notice of a motion Tuesday to consider the bill providing forthe purchase of a site for the UnitedStates supreme court but the proceedings with reference to this measurewill be confined to a speech by the Vermont senatorThe urgent army deficiency bill willreceive attention early in the weekThe committee on appropriations willmeet Monday and it is not believedthat more than one meeting on the billwill be necessarySenator Allison chairman of the committee hopes therefore to get the billbefore the senate for considerationTuesdayIt has been prophesised that thearmy bill would be used as a pretextfor discussion of the Spanish war andthe fear of such a course has not entirely subsidedBeyond the first three days there isno programme mapped out for thehouse this week Monday will be devoted under the rules to the considertion of business relating to the Districtof Columbia and on Tuesday the District of Columbia appropriation billwill be taken up This is in pursuanceof the determination of the leaders togive the appropriation bills the rightof way whenever one is ready Thereis nothing in the district bill this yearto attract opposition and unless theunexpected happens the bill ought tcpass Tuesday or Wednesday at thelatest The appropriations sub-committeeon pensions will commencework on the pension appropriationsbill Monday but it can hardly be readybefore next week It is confidentlyexpected however that it will bepassed before the holidays It ispossible that Chairman Hull ofthe military affairs committee willbe able to bring in the army reorganization bill as soon as thedistrict appropriation bill is outof the way He is exceedinglyanxious to get tho bill into the houseat the earliest possible moment as heis particularly solicitous that it shouldpass the house before the holidays Ifit should follow the district bill a veryinteresting debate wjjll be precipitatedThe future policy of the governmerJt isordained in the bill for the increaseof the standing army and the wholesubject will be opened up Thedemocrats are divided upon thequestion of increasing the regulararmy but how far the opposition will go in antagonizing the measure it is impossible to forecast Onlylast week during the debate on the urgent deficiency bill Mr De Armond ofMissouri one of the leaders evaded adirect reply when the question wasput fairly at him by Mr Cannon chairman of the appropriations committeeIf the army reorganization bill docnot come up the various committeesunder the call will probably be allowed to clean up business which theyhave on the calendarShot Through the Np ckGrafton W Va Dec 12 LutherWiseman a farmer

Rangedstanding behind them were numerousattaches of the American commissionThe jets from the crystal chandeliersabove the heads of those present magnified the brilliant green and scarlet ofthe upholsterings into gaudinessThere was a theatrical contrast between the black clothed actors andthe scenery To the Americansit was a happy ending of theepilogue of war for the Spaniards it was plainly a bitter tragedynone the less painful because long foreseen They sat silently as though a 1most crushed and none could withhold sympathy from Senor Montero Rios the president of the Spanish commission

Own CountryThis However Would Not Hold Good inThis Case Inasmuch as Cuba andPorto Kco Are or Soon WillBe Under Our FlagWashington Dec 12 A report tliatthe president intends to visit Cuba andPorto Rico at the first favorable opportunity has become known in thestate war and navy departments andwas quickly made the subject of serious speculation among various officials on account of the exceedingly interesting questions it raised Amongother things there was a spontaneous revival of the fiction thatthe chief executive could not passthe boundaries of the United Stateswithout forfeiting his office Itis peculiar how persistent isthe notion even among higher officialsthat some constitutional or statutoryrestriction confines the executive toAmerican soil when as a matter offact although none of President McKinleys predecessors have ever leftthe country during their terms of office their actions were alone affectedby considerations of propriety or precedent which no one could hold to applyin the present instanceIt was generally recognized tl at thepresident might naturally wish tomake a personal tour of inspection inthose islands as soon as he could sparetime from pressing public business inWashington and that no valid objectiod could stand against such a tour ashe was understood to contemplate Itis pointed out however that it wouldbe practically impossible for him tospare the time requisite for such anextended voyage as that to PortoRico before congress adjourns onMarch 4 which is fortunatelyabout the best time of the year to makea short stay in the tropics During thefirst six weeks of the new year in addition to the continuous executive routine business the social obligations involved in the programmes of publicreceptions and state dinners would restrict the president closely to Washington and after next weeks southerntour he will hardly find it possible toleave the white house for more thantwo days at a time before the beginningof lent in the middle of February Forthe ensuing two weeks with the rushof legislation which marks the closingiays of a short session of congressthere will be no leisure for the executive and therefore his pennant couldhardly fly in the harbor of Porto Ricobefore the middle of MarchWith Havana only a single nightsrun for thedispatch boat Dolphin fromTampa there might be a chance forthe president to spend two whole daysthere in a weeks absence from Washington and remain always in closecommunication with the executive departments so that if a critical emergency occurred he could be in a railway train speeding toward the capitalwithin 12 hours No thought is entertained however of a presidential tripto Havana before the Spanish flag ishauled down on January 1Practical unanimity of opinion prevails among officials that the contemplated visit of the president to Havanahas a full warrant as his trip to PortoRico so long as the American flag fliesover Cuba although a few quibblersmav hold that Porto Rico itselfis not actually a part of theUnited States territory until congress has made a declaration to thateffect either in so many words or byratifying the peace treaty of ParisThis fine point is not seriously raisedexcept to show that Porto Rico andCuba must be considered identical inview of the fact that they are governed precisely alike by military officers under the immediate direction ofthe president as commander-in-chiefThe belief i expressed that the president would not care to set foot inCuba if it were held to be foreign territory much as he might wish to seethe country for that might be a perilous precedent to establish butno one appears to controvert the rightas well as the advisability of an executive visit to the new American possessions provided it does not involvetoo long an

of the forest and its shadow covered him all but his face whichwas turned to me drawn and whiteHe was struggling against old habits ofabsolute obedience and they won Iunderstand M le ChevalierVery well then go on and remember what I have saidHe turned and stepped forward Thisway and mind the branches overheadand we entered the forest my horseleaping a low ditch that separated itfrom the grass land We took a softturf covered path overhung by branches and went on for about 50 paces before coming to a halt which we did ina small irregular patch of trees that layin the full flood of the moonlight Inthe darkness beyond I heard the gentlemurmur of a small spring and then thedistinct movement of a heavy body andthe clink of iron My hand reached tomy holster in a flash but Nicholas sawthe gesture and said It is the horseA moment monsieur and lifting upthe curtain of leaves beside him fromwhich as he did so the dew fell in asoft shower he dived into the thicket toreappear again leading the long blacklength of his horse It struck me atonce that the beast was of uncommonsize and this and the white star on itsforehead brought to my mind the recollection of De Rones great Englishcharger CouronneHarnibleu I burst out vou seemto be in the lowest water and here youhave a horse worth a hundred pistolesat the leastDid you see her by daylight monsieur you would know that

mares sleek neck wetand glistening with the dew and quickly mounting swung her round to thebit and laid her beside me It was notthe time for talk and we drew ot of theclearing in single file and after forcingour way through the wet and shiningleaves around us found a bridle pathAlong this my guide went at a trotNicholas suddenly pulled up and heldout a warning handWhat is it I asked in a low toneHist he said and then in a rapidwhisper Another 50 yards and wecome to the open Anet lies before usand the rest of the way must be doneon footAnd the horsesFasten them here You have a picketing ropeYes round the neck of the horseGood I had not noticed it beforeand was half afraid you had none monsieurThe horses were soon securely fastened and when this was done Nicholasspoke low and earnestly Should we bediscovered monsieur there is no usemaking a standing fight The odds aretoo many When we come to the openI will show you a withered oak Thisis exactly opposite where the horsesare in this direction If we are pursued make for the forest and lie downThe chances are they will pass us byThen to the horses and follow me If Igo down ride northwards for your lifeHow the devil am I to find my waythrough the treesNicholas shrugged his shoulders asif to sa that was my affairWe had gone too far to go back however and placing my pistol in beltand loosening my sword in its sheathI followed Nicholas with cautious footsteps As he said in about 50 j ards wecame to the open and halted close to ahuge oak bald of all leaves with itsgnarled trunk riven and scarred bylightning Before us a level stretch ofturf sloped gently down towards whatwas once an ornamental lake but nowovergrown with the rankest weeds Inthe center of the lake was a small island on which was set a summer housefashidned like a Moorish kiosque and-beyond this rose huge and square theenormous facade of the chateau It wasin darkness except foran oriel windowabove a long terrace on the east winiwhich was bright srjih light and inthe courtyard belaw there was evidently fire Men were singing round itand a lilting chdrus came to our earsInch by inch we crept onward keeping well in the shadow and edging ourway round the frills of the forest Icould hear Nicholas breathing hardand from tire to time he stopped torest but I vas a glad man to find Iwas not winded and that therefore Imust be truly as strong again as everI was At last by dint of creepingcrawling and wriggling along weworked our way to within 20 paces ofthe terrace above which the stainedglass of the oriel window glowed withlight Here we came to a stop andwatched Sometimes we saw a shadowmoving backward and forward in thelight of the window then the shadowwas joined by another and bothstopped as if the two men to whomthey belonged were in earnest converseWe must get to the window I whispered with an inquiring lookBy the terrace said Nicholas inanswer and as he spoke there came tous the faint but distinct sound of ahorn apparently from the very depthsof the forest and the notes roused abrace of hounds in the courtyard whobayed into the night Nicholas grippedmy arm and I turned to him in surprise His face was pale he was shaking all over like an aspen and his blackejes were dilated with fearDid you hear that monsieur hesaid quicklyDiable What I hear three different things dogs men and some oneblowing a hornThen you did hear it the hornYes What of it No doubt a poston its way to AnetNo post ever rang that blast monsieur That is the Wild Huntsman andthe blast means deathAs he spoke it came again wild andshrill with an eerie flourish the like ofwhich I had never heard before Thedogs seemed to go mad with the soundthere was a hubbub ja the courtyardand some one in the chamber above theterrace threw open the sash and peeredout into the night I thought at first itwas de Gomeron but the voice was nothis for after looking for a moment hegave a quick order to the men belowand stepped in againto be

bird Oneday I was lucky enough to see the birdas it was rising to its climax in the airand identified it as the vesper sparrowThe flight of 75 or 100 feet was briefbut it was brilliant and striking andentirely unlike the leisurely chant ofthe bird while upon the ground It suggested a lark but was less buzzing orhumming The preliminary chirpingnotes uttered faster and faster as thebird mounted in

60 years old a wiseprince and much beloved by his peopleFour handsome sons had been born tohim who were the pride of his houseand the consolation of his old age-Renewing in these noble princes hisown youth Prince Brancovan and hisstill beautiful wife with their- ter Princess Roxandra lived aple uneventful life in their capital city- jof Bucharest The people looked uponthe prince as their father and lief fied this attitude by the pains he tookito make his rule a blessing to themthese dajs there does not remainv - ny trace of the insecurity in which theJ -inhabitants of the two principalities- then lived and which compelled themto conceal their treasures in wondenV coffers which covered with carpetsand the richest Turkish stuffs formedpart of the furniture of a chamber-and were capable of easy removal toa place of safety when their enemies- the Turks made a raid into the countryPrince Consrtantin Brancovan hadlong grown distasteful to the sultan1 JsSrje cauKe of his wise and nobleI 1fterand of his having made himself be-JgjeAfctall his subjects He had alsoaccumulated vast wealth and hadcaused rold nieces to be coined thisZ - - JiboKed upon as an act ofV ainorion to his suzerainThere were certain individuals at thej porte willing enough to aggravate theanger of the sultan and amongst these- was a Greek doctor who had presumed-to fall in love with the beautifulcess RoxandraWith his courteous ways andpedge of men and countries he foundiavor with the four young princes andV accomplished his desireof being nowagain with the Princess Roxandraherself What had at first been merely a passing whim now became thenecessity of his being and theGreekpassionately resolved that in spite ofj lier rank and his nationality the-- cess should be hisAt last- having done all that hecould to further ingratiate himself withjrince Brancovan the Greekthe question He dwelt uxonhis wealth which he had taken caretc give an appearance of during hisstay in the capital his influence withT the Turks his desire to see Wallachiafreed from her bondage and7 iered beginning a nobler future ThenTi tmiphpd nnon liis nersonal honeshis nephew and Prime Minister YacarescuIt was just before Eaatertide that theprisoners were forcibly dragged to Constantinople and cast into the prison ofthe Seven Towers This famous prisonis situated at the end of the land wallof Constantinople where it meets theSea of Marmora Many and harrowing are the tales of mystery and bloodshed associated with its ancient wallsThis was the place to which Brancovanhis sons and nephew were conductedand in which they were immured untilthe following August Brancovan andVacarescu were put to the most excruciating torture in order to compelthem to confess where they had concealed their accumulated riches forthe Turks had not found as much goldas they expected although theysearched for and destroyed everythingwherein they thought it might havebeen hiddenBrancovan had sent part of his largefortune to Venice but he would notreveal the fact in spite of all the terrible tortures to which he was subjected and which are described by oneof his secretaries as being so atrociousas to make ones hair stand on endsimply to read the account At lengththe Turks understood that they hadnothing more to gain from the princeand bade him prepare for immediatedeath On hearing this Brancovansummoned his sons to his presence andsaid to themMy children our fortunes are lostour lives are about to be sacrificed butwe must not lose our precious soulsBe brave my beloved ones feai nodeath you know what Christ sufferedfor our sake and what a cruel deathhe endured I pray you remain steadfast in your faith flinch not at all inthe face of the world The four handsome youths stood respectfully beforetheir father bareheaded and listenedto his words Each in turn kissed hishand and he looked with dimmed eyeaupon these his sons who were the prideof his life the hope of his house andwhom he was now exhorting to die aChristians should When he came tohis youngest born who was still achild his eyes overflowed with tearsSoon footsteps were heard in the adjoining room a Pasha entered andbade them all accompany him to thepresence of the sultanThe aged prince soon stood before hissuzerainBrancovan said the latter is thistrue which I hear of thee that thouwouldst throw off thy allegiance anddeclare the independence of thy principality Say is it true that thou hasteven dared to coin money from thy owngold Thou art fearless as if ihou wertthy own master What hast thou toplead in justificationWhether I have governed well or illGod above is the best judge but if Iwere once a power on the earth seenow to what ignominy I am reducedreplied the captive prince with dignityBrancovan measure thy wordsthou and thine are condemned to deathnot one of thy rebellious tribe shali escape his doont - jAs God willsyour handsBut he had hardly expressed himself their handsBecomebefore the pnnce interposedaly and emphatically he declared it in-possible for such a request even to be- considered And when the Greek-pressed his suit Prince Brancovanusually so calm grew angry and sum-J inarily dismissed his visitor That was-the end of the Greeks hopes but not ofJulias designs He had in his selfish de-sires pretended to be what he was notand he was no sooner out of PrinceBranco vans presence than he began to-think of revenge He at once removedsiJtc Constantinople and sought all meansof ingratiating himself with the sultanv- He was so servile and flattering thatlie soon became a prime favorite andthen with subtle cunning he com-inenced a systematic persecution ofiiJBraneovan He represented himself tothe sultan as a friend of Turkey andanxious that the provinces over whichshe possessed suzerainty should be under more effective control than was thecase at present He proceeded to relatethat he had visited Wallachia in orderto ascertain the opinions of the peoplev and their ruler with regard to TurkeyVind then repeated parts of conversations he had had with Prince Brancovan talcing cure to magnify theprinces patriotic expressions intoj threats against his suzerain He alsor told the sultan that vast stores of goldliad been accumulated by the princeand that there was little doubt butxhat this was to be devoted to the raising of an army when the time shouldfce ripe for the Wailachians to rebellso that the prince was conductingwiriilar and secret correspondence withibrne of the neujnqormg bimcs xcimfortunafe rnce was speedily takenwell as nis wuer incuit our lives are inThe populace crowded to witness theexecutions Brancovan looked calmlydown on the multitude amongst themhe recognized the princess his wifrand their daughter Roxandra whomthe Turks in their refinement of savagecruelty had compelled to witness theterrible spectacle The princes facedarkened as the Muezin or Turkishpriest advanced and after making theusual three salaams thus addressedhimMy master we have an ancient custom here to the effect that a condemned prisoner may be pardoned if hebe willing to change his religion andembrace our holy Mahomedan faithThen the sultan called in a loud voiceBrancovan renounce thy dog likeChristian belief thou and thy sons embrace that of our own and then shallye all go forth freeBetter that my race should perishthan that we should deny our sacredreligion was the undaunted replyThen must ye all prepare for deathsaid the sultan frowning and gaveorders that Vacarescu should be the-first on whom the soldiers should layone of our followers forsake thy master live be rich and happy said the Muezin to himA Vacarescu does not betray hisprince or his church said the ex minwas instantly recapitatedThe officials then seized on the thirdson of the prince a haughty youthwith eyes full of fire and hair blackas the ravens wingDeny thy faith and I wTill sparethee said the sultanDo not insult me by speaking thussaid the boy and kneeling down aihead was severed from his body androlled to his fathers feetThe old man sighed heavily and hislong beard trembled as he said Lordthy will be doneThe sultan then pointed to the second son who fell imploringly at hisfathers feet The prince grew palewith fear lest his son should fail himbut the latter blushing raised hiapenetrating eyes to those of his father and saidI alone of all thy children havecaused thee trouble and vexationthrough my wayward heart and myquick blood I cannot go to sleep the-tiful daughter his our SbnVlnd fc Oh pceivfcffraii IKe sultan criedForsake thy religion lce thnllifeis sweet to thee embraco our faith beirae be happy uThe young Brancovan did not seemto hear these words but took from hisvest an Icoana a sacred image whichhe wore next to his heart and holdingit out saidIf any among ye here have pity uponme let him send this holy Icoana tomy dear young wife It will be a consolation to her until the hour of herdeathNot a hand was raised to take theholy jewel and casting it on theground and crushing it with his foothe exclaimed So sanctified a relicshall not be defiled by your PagantouchKneeling down he kissed the remnants of the broken Icoana and signedto the executioner to do his WorkPrince Brancovan sighed once moredeeply but said again Good LordThy will be doneThen the sultan calledBrancovan a single child now onlyremains to thee Reflect before ttiousacrifices him alsoThe prince looked on the form of hisdelicate boy on his wife below whohad fainted and was happily still insensible on his beautiful daughter whowas choking with convulsive sobs andafter making the sign of the crossagain saidThe Lords will be doneChild cried the sultan If - thouwilt embrace our faith thou shalt liveard be happjThe boys soft eyes sought those ofhis father as if to gain strength andcourageI die willingly my father he saidin a firm tone It is true that I amyoung but I am of thy raceAnd shortly his youthful headcrowned with rich dark curls was severed from his bodyThen and then only did the oldmans strength fail him as he fell onhis knees and kissed the headlesscorpseAt length he rose in great fury andcursed his enemies crying- out Pagans you have slain my four sonsMay God destroy jou and jours maylie wipe you all from the face of theearth May You have no ground inwhich to be buried and may your soulsnever know peace or restThe sultan and his servants were sohighly incensed at this anathema thatthej tore off his vestments in shredsit is even said that they tore the skinfrom liis flesh the while calling himGhiour Dog of a

KY TUESDAY DECEMBER lft 1898-MEXICAN INDIAN DENTISTRXThe Teeth of the Natives Were CutBear Tran Fast I on and PluggedLiberal- with IronIt is no new fact that some of theaboriginal peoples of Mexico wore ornaments or incrustations in their teethLie Alfredo Chavero possessed afront tooth taken from a tomb at Palenque in the middle of which a greenstone is set Sometimes the incrustations were of gold and the incrustations of iron pyrites when they werenew and the sulphur in them was freshundoubtedly shone like goldThere is reason to suppose that onlythe eight front upper teeth were incrusted at any rate as a rule for a secong bicuspid given by Mr Batres to DrJose J Rojo the young Mexican dentist in Dr Howes office and also takenErom the Mitla tomb is without anysuch incrustation On the other handa canine given by Mr Batres to DrRojo has the incrustation and also affords evidence that these ornamentswere made during life and not afterdeath The present condition of thetooth shows that the incrustation hadreached the nerve cavity and destroyedthe life of the tooth a process that argues life in the subject as decay of theteeth does not occur after death themicrobes or organisms which cause decay dying with the individualAs to the object and significance ofthese incrustations they are a matterof conjecture They may have been affected by all who could afford them orthey may have been a distinctive markof some rank or caste What is evidentfrom the specimen possessed by DrRojo is that they must have caused suffering to those who used them andtherefore it is to be inferred that thefashion or custom which prescribedthem must have had a strong social orreligious sanctionAnother custom revealed by the teethfound in these prehistoric tombs is thatof notching the teeth so as to formdove tailing indentations Each contiguous pair of upper front teeth werenotched for a certain distance upwardand sideways so as to bear a resemblance to battlements turned upsidedown The lower teeth were alternately cut ofE and left of their natural sizeso as to fit in with the notches aboveIn other words a lower tooth situatedbelow a cavity above was left of itsnatural size and the adjoining toothwas cut off for some distance Ofcourse the upper and lower teeth thustreated would not meet at once butit is a fact well known to dentists thatif an upper tooth is cut off the corresponding lower tcoth will graduallygrow up to it and vice versa if a lowertooth is sawed off the correspondingupper tooth will grow down to itTherefore in course of time thenotched teeth of these prehistoric Indians fitted into one another exactljand must have given them a peculiarlyfirm grip upon anything they got between their teethThe fragment of skull which DrHowe has as well as the tooth dscolored red which must have resultedfrom their being dipped in mercuryThis was naturally a post mortem operationThe cavity in the tcoth in which theincrusation of iron pyrites is insertedit is loose

Ofteathe CauseIn a learned paper on the subject- xijconvergent strabismus by Prof Priestley Smith which constituted the lastBowman lecturr of the Ophthalmological society it is stated that the onsetof strabismus is often attributed to afit a fright a fall or other such occurrence and still more often to an illnessfrach as whooping cough or measlesMaking allowance for the frequency ofsuch events among children and for acertain disregard of time and sequencein their eldera it seems to me savsProf Smith highly probable that thesesupposed causes are very oftea realcauses Some such explanation of theonset was given with show of reasonin more than two fifths of my casesand the proportion would no dcubthave been higher had not many of thepatients been brought by persons whoknew nothing of their antecedents Inmany cases the history was definite andnot to be upset by cross examinationFor example a child who had neverbeen seen to squint before came fromschool squinting badly having thatmorning been put into the corner witha cloth over her head another did thesame immediately after having his headpushed into a bucket of water by hisbrother another after sitting in scalding water another after being terrifiedby a monkey which jumped on to hershoulder No less clear in many caseswas the history of onset during measleswhooping cough or other constituticnal disordersAll these are conditions which maygravely disturb the nervous systemShock anger or apprehension impairthe control of muscular action theycause the knees to shake the voice totremble and even the hand of the opthalmic surgeon to become unsteadyFebrile disorders cause delirium convulsions and sometimes transient strabismus and leave the nervous S3stem exhausted Is it not highly probable thatsuch disorders occurring in young children may interrupt the action of thosehigher centers which control the movement of the eyes and this not onlywhere control isalready difficult bj reason of amblyopia or error of refractionbut even in children whose visual apparatus is normal for their time of lifebut not yet fully developed The oldidea that the squinting child needs a little skillful surgery and nothing more isdying out Most people know thatglasses are often necessary But thatthe child may require teaching at sometrouble to use the squinting eye is anew idea to many It is easily graspedhowever and must be grasped if ourefforts are to be effective I have usedthe word educative as a help in that direction Of course there are parentsand there are children on whom alltime and trouble spent in this way areentirel3r thrown away but on the wholeI have been surprised at the careand patience with which directionahave been carried out even in homeswhere one might least expect it London StandardTOO

the Questionas SnmmedOJii by the Ij A Wnigliivay Committee-That highways should be built andmaintained by those who live along1them is an ancient doctrine but an unjust one Fifty years ago Macaulaydescribed how unfairly the practiceoperated in the seventeenth centuryhow toll roads succeeded it and finallyfree turnpikes But in this country wehave only recently begun to see its injustice an to realize that the relatively sparsely settled country with itscomparatively small amount of taxableproperty cannot equitably shoulderthe burden of constructing and maintaining the major part of the highwaysof the country for the use of everybodyThis subject is treated by A BChoate of the L A W highway committee in circular No 31 of the Government Oflice of Road Inquiry onState Aid After years of agitation he says and condemnation ofthe farmers for failure to build goodcountry roads the agitators have discovered that they have been trying towork an injustice upon the farmersThe mistake was not in demandinggood roads but in asking the farmersto build good country roads withouttaxing city property to help pay forthemEquality of taxation is a familiarprinciple yet nothing could be moreunequal than to tax farm propertyalone for the construction of roadswhich ultimately benefit the entirecommunity In the newer states thetaxable property is more nearly equally divided between town and countrybut in the older ones the preponderance is gieatly in towns and cities inNew York the proportion being aboutsix to oneThe bearing which this fact hasBays Mr Choate upon the question ofstate aid for building country wagonroads is very apparent for if the farmers are required to pay taxes on theirproportionately very small amount ofproperty to improve the long stretchesof country

illustratedbelow the upright piece A is 1 by 3inches 2 to 3 feet long and sharpenedso as to be driven firmly into theground It sustains a heavy oak blockB attached to it by two woodenclamps C which allow it to slide upand down with great freedom Nailedon the block is a crosspiece D 10inches long and 2 inches wide whichhas at each end two stout wires inserted an inch apart and made very sharpThe block B is sustained in an elevated position by the piece E whichpasses through the upright just farenough to catch upon the block whenin the position shown in the cut It isheld in this position by the piece F GHANDY MOLE TRAPin one end of which at F notches arecut and the slightest elevation of theopposite end G disengages the pieceE and lets the block fallThe trap is so arranged that whenthe block drops the pins will enter themole track which is undisturbed except by flattening it down with thefoot even with the surface just at theplace where the end G of the pieceF G will come The block is loweredonce or twice to make sure the pinswill penetrate the soil without difficulty The trap is set and G justtouches the ground where it is trodden down over the mole track Theblock must have a fall of 12 to 14 inchesThe pieces E and F G are each about35 inches long and made very lightThe slightest lifting at G will throwE out of the notch in F and let theblock fall The mole approaches fromeither direction and when he raises theground before him springs the trap andthe points will pierce his bodyExperiments have proved that thebest distance apart for the pairs ofwires is 9 inches letting them enter theground about 4ys inches from the pieceG The block B is a piece of roughscantling with the piece C nailed onIt is a good plan to put another wireinto the middle of the piece D at eachend about 2 inches fronfthe twoouterones whicn will prevent any chanceof its failing to catch the mole whensprung Arsenic mixed with corn meald dropped into mole runs usuallysoon destroys the animals Grains ofcorn pricked at the heart and a littlearsenic put in and raw potatoes witharsenic introduced usually prove effectual also but require careful preparation Farm and HomeMAKING CIDER VINEGARPlan Nov In Vogue Is to Run It OverShavings at a Fairly HiyrhTemperatureThe Virginia experiment station hasbeen conducting some experiments todetermine if it be feasible for the ordinary farmer to attempt to fermezthis own vinegar As is known by mostof our readers the old way of making cider vinegar is to allow the ciderto stand in barrels for from one to twoyears before using it The more -e-centplan is to run it over shavingsiJ a moderate heat By this means1 mentation progresses rapidly and thecider is soon changed into commercialvinegar In the case of the Virginia experiments the generators used consisted of a 4xS foot wooden tank filledwith beech shavings The tank wasprovided with holes near the bottomfor the admission of air and fitted onefoot from the top with a wooden discperforated to allow the entrance of thecider which was distributed evenlyover it by means of a dumper Thevinegar was drawn from the ank bymeans of a syphon of glass tubing inserted in a hole near the bottom Thetemperature of the fermenting cider inthe mass of shavings was controlledby regulating the supply ofair some ofthe air holes being shut off when thetemperature rose too high and openedwhen it fell too lowIn order to acidify the shavings andstart the process of fermentation thegenerator was charged with strongvinegar and again with vinegar inwhich some concentraed grape juicewas dissolved The stock solutiona mixture of weak vinegar andfermented cider was then run throughthe generator at the rate of 20 gallons in 24 hours The resulting productwas a very good vinegar ranging from405 to 5S7 per cent acid A mixtureof half vinegar and half fresh ciderfailed to produce good vinegar withoutbeing run through the generator twiceBetter results were obtained by allowing the vinegar to ferment for sometime in casks before running it throughthe generator The temperature within the generator two feet from the bottom ranged from 88 to 106 degrees Thehigher temperature caused the loss ofalcohol and lowered the acidity of theproduct Temperature below 90 did notgive good results The best is thoughtto be about 95 Farmers ReviewWhen celerygete frozen it will notkeep ax

the right shoulderCarry the ribbon around the neckgoing toward the front first and theniasten it just in front of the left shoulder again on the lower seam of the collar A round fancj pin should be usedfor this purpose and the girl who hasiuherited a quaint old fashioned breastpin will find it just what she needsA pretty stock for a girl with a slimneck is made of silk shirred on fourheavy cords and put aroiind the neckvery loosely A stock of this kindshould end at the back with a rosetteof the corded silkMuch more suitable for the thicknecked girl is a stock of simple tuckedsilk which lies flat and adds nothingto sizeThe old fashioned bow tie will appearin great numbers but let the short girlbeware of using it too offten It isvery apt to take from lfer the smart appearance so essential to good formand give her an objectionable dumpylook She may however wear the tieif it is knotted with short narrowloops and has ends that widen out andreach to the foot of the gown Or shemay wear the short soft tie fastenedin four-in-hand instead of with bowknotThe tall girl may wear the short tiewith a large loose bow knot anfasIcn it at the throat with a fancy broochThe tie should be about six inches inwidth It may be made of silk tullehiffon or mousseline de soie Laceends add ornamentation and are considered quite chicWhite and delicately tinted necktrimmings brighten up the most somber of gowns and give a dressy yet Avellgroomed effect that is very desirableTherefore the fact that they will bemuch wTorn throug hout the winter willbe welcomed by most girlsThe Medici collar will once more makeits appearance during the coming winter It will be much worn in combination with the tie whose ends reach tothe floor mentioned aboveVests will be the delight of the winter girl She will have her gown madein such a way that the vest can bechanged and then she will scheme forthe greatest variety of vests ownedb any of the girls in her circleCoat collars are of two kinds Thesingle breasted coat buttons up tightto the neck finishing there with astiff high collar Double breastedcoats open slightly at the neck andhave the regidation small coat reversThe former style is likely to prove

Entranceto a PenitentiaryMr Owen Kelly whose home is on theEalls road enjoys the doubtful honorof having his likeness carved in thegranite entrance to the new penitentiary building Mr Kelly formerlyowned a piece of ground which he soldto the directors of the penitentiarywhen they were acquiring property forthe location of the new buildings Hewas greatly interested in the erectionof the buildings and spent most of histime in the vicinity talking with theworkmen and constituting himself asort of independent superintendentSome few weeks ago a stone carverbegan cutting ornamental designs inthe granite arch which forms the entrance on Forrest street to the administration building The architects design called for the faces of two men onthe inside of the arch One face depictsa prisoner entering the institutionThe face wears a mustache and thedowncast eyes speak plainly of the feelings of a man who is about to be shutout from the world to pay the penaltyof a crime against the laws of the stateOpposite this face is carved the faceof a prisoner who has expiated hiscrime and is leaving the prison Hiaface is smoothly shaven and the artisthas succeeded fairly well in giving theface an expression of happiness and satisfaction over his releaseOutside the arch the architect provided for the carving of two satyrsOne of these can be plainly seen in thestone but on the other side appearswhat is said to be an excellent likenesaof Mr Kelly The story goes that MrKelly asked why his likeness could notbe carved in the stone Any face woulddo for the carver and he readily consented to fix the likeness of Mr Kellythere indelibly Baltimore SunOne AdvantageStill living ir a boarding house hMits advantagesI dont know of anyy ell there are generally few urnbrellas around

by thechemists of the health departmentwith the result that a swindle in theadulteration of butter will be exposedin a formal report at the next meetingof the board of health Chief Food Inspector Dockery seized samples of suspicious butter in a house on Missionbtreet thinking that because it crumbled apart like cheese it was merely acombination of oils or oleomargarineHe was more than surprised howeveron being told by Prof Green thechemist in charge that the article submitted for analysis was butter and agood average sample of butterat thatThere was but one peculiar characteristic in the butter water oozed from itin large drops when the butter W3spread upon bread and when pressedwith a knife upon a slap it decreasednoticeably in bulkHow do you account for thatDockery asked his question beingprompted by the chemists statementBy the use of a form of pepsin andalkalis and salt the butter is emulsifiedor made to absorb its own weight ofwater For instance in making up thebutter one pound of good butter wastaken and put into a vessel with onepound of milk A little pepsin and saltsof some kind were added Then thedifferent ingredients were churned together and after a little while the milkhad disappeared with the chemicalsand there were two pounds of butterThis compound will retain its increasedweight for a considerable time butwhen exposed to the atmosphere theouter edges dry and crumble likecheese All that be said of the samplesis that they are doctored butter Theygive no signs of adulterationI took this stuff from F Rexingerin his room on Mission street saidDockeryThey were making it in a room inthe lodging houses and selling themethod Bexinger showed me a handful of twenties and said he got themfrom a fellow who had bought the secreat that morning for 300Bexinger came from Honolulu andmust have brought the scheme to thiscity from the islands for I never sawanything like this butter before in SanFrancisco It tastes like good butterand one can be deceived till you see thewater coming out of it from underneath the knife Chicago ChronicleFolk LoreThe research into popular beliefs isan absorbing and not a profitless studyScarcely a day passes
