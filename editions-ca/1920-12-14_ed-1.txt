Caywood, of North Middletown, BourbonCounty, as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for State Senatorfrom this, the Twenty-eighth Senatorial District, composed of Bourbon,Clark and Montgomery Counties. Ascustom in the past ha& decreed thatat this time Bourbon County furnished the candidate, it is probable thatMr. Caywood's candidacy will meetwith no opposition.Mr. Caywood is one of Bourbon'smost progressive and popular citizens, and since attaining his majoritynas been connected with the businessinterests of this community. Mr.Caywood is actively identified withthe agricultural interests of BourbonCounty, owning a large amount offertile land which annually producebountiful crops, besides the live stockraised annually on his land. He isin the strict sense of the word .a"dirt farmer," and his long andvaried experience in the conduct" ofhis farming, interests and his wideacquaintance with the stock dealinginterests of Kentucky make him anideal candidate to honestly and effectively represent the constituents ofthis great farming and live stock 'producing District.Mr. Caywood served four yearsas Deputy Assessor of BourbonCounty, and later was elected Assessor for four years, and his administration of this important office was discharged with general satisfaction tothe tax payers of Paris and BourbonCounty.For the past ten years Mr. CayWood has been the Kentucky representative of Swift &, Co., pork andbeef packers, and during that periodhe has no doubt spent millions of dollars in payment for the great amountof live stock purchased from farmersin this locality.Mr. Caywood has always taken anactive interest in the upbuilding andwell being of Bourbon County, giving largely of his time and means forthose things that appeared advantageous to this community. Duringthe great World War, Mr. Caywoodwas actively interested in all of thewar work undertakings -in BourbonCounty, actively serving on all ofthe important committees, and lending every aid to the Government inthe successful prosecution of thegreat conflict. His donations atLalltimes to the Red Cross, SalvationArmy, Knights of Columbus Y. M. !C A., and other equally commendable organizations were extremelyliberal, as were also his subscriptionsto the many Liberty Bondand WarSavings Stamp campaigns.Mr. Caywood has given a greatdeal of time to the tobacco interestsof the Bluegrass region, of which hegrows a large amount annually. Heis actively connected with the Paristobacco market, being Vice Presidentof the Bourbon Tobacco WarehouseCo., which actively operates threelarge brick warehouses in Paris. Heis a director in the Peoples DepositBank & Trust Co., in Paris; holds asimilar connection with the NorthMiddletown Deposit Bank, and isChairman of the. North MiddletownGraded School Board.. Mr. Caywood is a pleasing andagreeable gentleman, extremelypopular throughout the Bluegrassregion, and his friends predict thathe will be honored with the nomination he is seeking without opposition.Mr. Caywood's card to the Democratic voters of Bourbon, Clark andMontgomery Counties follows:Mr. H. S. Caywood Announces Candidacy For Senator.To the Voters of Bourbon, Clark andMontgomery Counties:I wish to announce myself as acandidate for the Democratic nomination for State Senator from this,the Twenty-eighth Senatorial District; comprising the counties ofBourbon, Clark and Montgomery,and to ask the voters of this districtto consider my candidacy when casting their votes.If nominated and elected to thisimportant position as your Senatorialrepresentative I promise to give tothe office the best effort there is inme for the advancement of the greatinterests of my constituents and tothe interests of the State at large, asI see it.There has been much discussionrecently regarding the advisabilityof calling an extra session of theKentucky Legislature to submit aFifty Million Dollar road bond issueto the voters of Kentucky and to thismovement I desire to voice my oppo-sitioii at this time. The proposition jis preposterous, and in my judgment,if it were submitted to the voters ofKentucky it would he overwlielmingly defeated.I have always been an advocate ofgood roads, but if the farmers andbusiness men of Kentucky don't getsome kind of relief f rom the burdensome Federal, State nd County taxesit means disaster under the prevailing conditions. The State and County tax rateshave remained about thesame, but under the exciting specula-been passing, values have been raisedon real estate from two hundred tothree hundred per cent, and we arenow paying from two to three timesas" much'Tuoney out for' taxes as welpaid three years ago.

'both of capital and laboring classes,who set up standards of "rights,"which when analyzed usually give totheir favored followers an advantage over the rest of society. It isdisapproval against this small autocratic class who speak more fortheir "leadership" than they do fortheir corstituency, that has broughtthe reproach upon Wall street. ForWall Street is simply a great moneycenter for the nation, and it is asnecessary as are the "money centers" of the small and large townsof the country. These money centersare called banks, no matter whetherthev exist in Wall Street or atSmith's Crossing.AUTO SUPPLANTS HOBSEThat the automobile is fast supplanting "man's best friend," thehorse, was evidenced here Monday.It was noticed that there were moresecond-hand machines offered for saleon the "public square" than therewere horses or jmules.

A high standardof scholarship has been maintainedby the plavers, rigidly enforcementof the eligibility rules of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association has been maintained all year.Paris High School employes college officials for every game, andthis insures competent ofnciaia,which fact is good encouragementfor both home teams and visitorsand eliminates all possibility of petty wrangling which so often prevails in High School games.

The investigation followed the realization that stern stepswould have to be taken soon to curbthe ever-increasing number of theftsdue to the laxity of 'the present laws.To help State legislatures in thiseffort, the Chamber has drawn up amodel anti-theft law which will bepresented to all State assemblies attheir next sessions. The law, asdrafted, is intended especially to regulate the purchase and sale of usedmotor vehicles and parts. It providesfor the licencing of the business ofdealing in second-hand vehicles, andprohibits the removal, mutilation oraltering of makers' numbers.A State jmotor vehicle commissioner, provided by-1 his law, is to havecharge of all records of sales andexchanges of used cars, of all carsheld in storage or for repair.Affidavits describing the automobile tc be transferred from one person to another must be filled oat byboth persons in the transaction andwith the details of the transfer,must be filed with the State MotorVehicle Commissioner.In case of theft of a car, the motor vehicle commissioner of . everyState is to be notified and given tdescription of the State in which thetheft occurred. On the recovery ofa stolen car, all commissioners are tobe notified.Under the same law, every garageor repair shop must keep a descriptive record of every car left for storage ob repair and must reyort to thepolice if they find an identificationmark or number mutilatedchanged.The Kentucky State law requiring each county in the State to havean attendance officrr has resulted inrn increase in average attendanceat the public schools of more than100 per cent, over last year, according tc incomplete figures received athe office of the State Superintenu-nt of Public Instruction Colvin, whoaid in making known the averages,ihe average attendance was 37 pernt. of the chlidren of school age.Thus far this year The average reported has been between 85 and 90per cent.oPeople who are forever findingfault with their present surroundings are naggers, whiners, complainers.

The law requires thesuperintendents to imake such reportsto the railroads, who in turn mustinclude -them in the returns to thelax commission.Superintendent Colvin says: "Thisdoes not seem to have been done inthe past, and corporations have escaped paying taxes that gradedschool distiicts were legitimately 'entitled to receive."Each superintendent is requestedby Superintendent Colvim to sendhim at once the boundaries of allgraded school districts in theircounty, with the name of the railroad company, the telegraph company, the interurban line companyor other public service corporationsrunning through each and every oneof these districts SuperintendentColvin says that if he can get thisinformation before the tax commission by January 1, it will mean therecovery of tremendous "sums 'ofmoney for school purposes.Jtum I ';a - m r wififteen .
