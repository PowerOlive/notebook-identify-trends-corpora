He came up out ofthe coal chute as if it were a Hundugout, all the while bestowing hiscompliments on the coal hole in language best suited to the occasion.To bystanders who witnessed theaccident and helped him out of hispredicament, Rayle said:.-" I have been in the front linetrenches. I've fought all over FranceLin many of the hard drives, and Ihave escaped without a scratch. Andhere I have to come to this goldarnedplace and fall in a-coal hole and getall bunged up.

Houses sat still and scowledwhile a group of Democrats applauded." . Gee, but they were a mad bunch!Senator Cummins introduced a resolution to send a committee of eightSenators to France to "observe andreport to the Senate."

Washington wasn't much madder than it waswhen the President started to exchange "scraps of paper" with Germany. Eventually the town and theworld became so enthusiastic overthe net results of that venture in"notes."Time alone will tell whether thePresident will succeed in the greatmission that has taken him over seas.The patient American people, irrespective of politics or matters ofminor concern, are as eager to-day asthey were at the beginning of thewar, for the triumph of real worlddemocracy, and if Woodrow Wilson isone of the principal factors at thepeace conferences in bringing aboutthat result, his countrymen will alleasily forget they differed with himin the past few weeks, and renderpraise "ungrudgingly."Bon voyage, Mr. President!CUBE AT A COST OE 25 CENTS."Eight years ago when we firstmoved to Mattoon, I was a great sufferer from indigestion and constipation," writes Mrs. Robert Allison,Mattoon, 111.

YoungFrakes is a (member of the 2 2d Engineer Batallion, doing duty with theAmerican Expeditionary Force inFrance. He has been in the war zonelong enough to hear the shriek ofsliell and the hiss of shrapnel. Hesays, in part:"In France, Nov. 5."Dear Mother: Well, it seemsstrange that I should be here, buthere I am, and hoping to get backsound and all right again, which Ihope will be very soon. I am righthere on. the firing line Here comesthe mail and with two letters fromyou. Oh, I tell you that letters certainly do look good to us, and especially when they come from thehome folks.

We don't getmuch time in the day and not a greatdeal of time in the night At thistime, November 5, it looks as if weAmericans may have a hand in end-,ing this war pretty soon, from whatI can hear. We get plenty of excitement now all the time, with bigshells and shrapnel bursting allaround us all the time. J had a timegetting used to it, but don't mind itat all -now. It is getting hard to become used to the "whiz-bangs," aswe call these immense shells thatburst around us. They are certainlyterrors, and there's nothing in theEnglish language that can describethe horrible noise they make whenthey explode.

These statistics show thatin the instance of malnutrition alone,16 per cent, of the country childrenare below normal against 7.65 percent below normal for the city-dwelling child. It is further stated thatthe present physical inferiority of thecountry child is due to the rural prejudice against "new fangled" notions.City mothers do not entertain thissentiment, and in the toothbrushbridges or nail-cleaning drills whichthey enforce they have done a largepart toward making the city a saferplace to live. The draft for theAmerican Army added evidence tothis conclusion, for the city boy passed higher physical tests than the boywho had lived in ignorance of scientific health training.LOOK AT A CHILD'STONGUE WHEN" CROSSFEVERISH AND SICKTake No Chances!
