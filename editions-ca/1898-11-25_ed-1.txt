BOTJKBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY NOVEMBER 25 1898WAS A DISGRACEFUL FIASCOThe Corbett Sharkey Fight Ended in theNinth Round by Corbett Being Disqualified All Bets OffNew Yokk Nov 23 The SharkeyCorbett fight which was witnessed bythe largest and most representativegathering of sporting men that evercongregated to see a ring contest ended in a most disgraceful fiasco Tuesdaynight at the Lennox Athletic clubIn the second round there was wildyells from the admirers of Sharkeywhen he floored Corbett with a rightswing on the head preceded with spowerful blow on the body Sharkeysrushes were successful invariablyand Jims quickness and leg workwere tested to their utmost in tryingto evade the aggressive sailor pugilistThat Sharkey has improved wonderfully goes without saying and on theother hand that Corbett is not theCorbett of New Orleans is beyond question At no time had the Californianthe upper hand of his younger andmore stnrdy rival Sharkey is afighter and a clever one at that andhis work Tuesday night stamps himbejond all doubt as being second onlyto FitzsimmonsFrom the second to the eighth roundSharkey held a decided advantage Inthe ninth round which was so productive of disappointments and unlooked-forincidents Corbett seemed tobe stronger than at any time duringthe fight but it was evident that hewas slowly but surely fading underSharkeys onslaughts It was two toone on Sharkey after the second roundand had not McVey acted as he didthere is very little doubt thatSharkey would have won handily Someof the most prominent bankers brokerslawyers doctors and business men inthis and other cities were present during the mill and not one of them couldsee any reason for interference by McVey The general belief is that McVey acted from some unexplained motive and some persons said that hejumped into the ring to preventCorbett going under When McVeyfirst put his leg through the ropesthe referee evidently did not orwould not look in that direction butcontinued to pay close attention to thefighters who were mixing it up in thecenter of the ring Inspector McLaughlin caught hold of McVey to pull himout again but the latter was evidentlymore than anxious that Kellv shouldsee him In this he was successfulbut not until after half the people inthe house had yelled repeatedly to Kelly to disqualify CorbettWhen the big Californian realizedwhat had occurred he was furious withpassion and rushed at McVey Had hecaught the latter there is no tellingwhat Corbett would have done in hisfrenzy but the police were on handand rushed between the menthus avoiding a scene whichwould have added to the disgracefulexhibition Just what effect theuntimely incident will have on theboxing game in this vicinity in the future can not now well be gauged butthat

the coffeeand resting- on a bunk in the main roomMrs Hayne came hastening- in with outstretched hands and eyes still dim withweeping She was shocked at hishaggard appearance She could onlypress his hand in silent sympathy andstruggle hard to beat back the tearsthat would have flowed afresh Youwill staj here with us now until DrGould returns she said I look forhim any momentI No indeed I go on at once assoon as they can saddle a fresh horsefor me She must be more than halfway to the cantonment by this time ifMignon hasnt given outAnd then Mrs Hayne sobbed aloudOh Hand Randy Havent youheard

all thought of further rest forhim Bidding- the two troopers saddleanything on four legs that could carrythem he sprang forth into the still andradiant night and was astride his mongrel mount in a twinkling In vain MrsHayne came out and pleaded with himMerriam would listen to nothingnothing but tidings of Florence It wasbarely eight oclock when fully armedthe little party rode swiftly away under the northward stars following- anold trail that led to the upper foothillsof the Mescalero They were not halfan hour gone when a sergeant and twomen rode in from the west inquiringfor Dr Gould and Mrs Hayne Theywere three of Graftons men sent backfrom the chase to say they were hot onthe trail There were five Apachesafoot and one shod horse so the tracestold infallibly Florence then wasjirobably bound a prisoner on thathorse and Grafton would recapture heror lose every horse and man in the attemptAnd if that night was one of dreadand dejection at the ranch what mustit have been to Merriam reeling andwell nigh exhausted yet riding grimly desperately forward through thelong hours searching vainly vainly under the wan moonlight even alonginto the pallid dawn for that little cleftin the foothills Floy had named MonAbri Faint and shimmering the daybeams came at last and then and notuntil then Murdoch a faithful troopernow riding by his lieutenants side andsupporting him with his arm turned tohis comrade who dismounted wasstriving with the aid of a match or twoto study some hoof prints they hadfound in the soft surface Jimmy hewhispered theres something movingalong that ridge yonder coming thisway What is itAnd though soft the whisper itcaught poor Randys drowsy ear andhe strove to straightenin saddleWhat Where he faintly askedYonder sir not half a mile awayIts some of our fellows or Im a dufferYell to cm JimmyAnd obedient to the word JimmyyelledOver the l olling surface the sol-dieis voice went ringing throughthedawn and echo sent it clattering backfrom the buttes and bowlders to thewest This wajr you fellers thisway he cried and then mounting-clapped spurs to his pony and sputteredaway down the intervening swaleTen minutes later Randy Merriamwas lying on the ground iu a swoonand George Grafton with grave sadface well nigh as haggard as the lieutenants was bending over him andstriving to force some brand v down histhroat Following for all they wereworth the Apache trail they had overhauled the supposed marauders not 20miles back in the foothills a pacifichunting party provided with the agency pass and safeguard and culpableonly in that they had come too far andhad picked up on the plains an American horse abandoned at sight of themby some Mexicans who gallopedfar away and that American horseminus saddle and bridle was Floyspretty bay mare MignonThen where in heavens name wassheIt was some minutes before Merriamrevived Then he strove to stagger tohis feet but fell helplessly back Itwas nearly broad dajTight but the sunwas still below the distant GuadaloupcGathering his feeble energies Randystrove to describe the little cove and toimplore Grafton to bear him thitherand was interrupted by an eagersergeant who said We passed justsuch a brook sir not a mile back ShallI take half-a-dozen men and follow itupYes at once said Grafton and 111go too Stay here Randy Indeed thecaution was not needed for Merriamwas past moving- now poor fellow andhis head sank helplessly back upon thesoldiers supporting arm And thenthey rode away Grafton and half-a-dozenof his men with Mignon legweary and reluctant trailing behindAnd meantime the troop dismountedand set about making coffee while oneorderly rode back on the trail to summon Dr- Gould jogging wearily a milebehind And presently the doctorcame and knelt by Randys side andscolded through his set teeth evenwhile he skillfully stripped away thehunting shirt and so reached the shattered armThen came the glorious sunshinestreaming over the Guadaloupe andgilding the westward Mescalero andthen far out among- the buttes onetwo three at regular intervals theringing echoing- signals of the cavalrycarbine and rough garbed trooperssprang to their feet and shouted loudand clapped ball cartridge into thebrown bellies of their guns and firedunlicensed salvos into the air anddanced and swung their hats and drewcoarse flannel shirt sleeves across theirblinking eyes

toburst into tears of relief and 303 atsight of Graftons radiant yet haggardface then roused to instant action bythe tidings he bore and gently but reproachfully told her that thoughsorely wounded and well nigh exhausted it was Randy who guided therescuers to lfer and who now lay prostrate and unconscious barely a mileaway Then she could hardly wait forthem to saddle Mignon could hardlyirrge her laboring fa vorite fast enoughto match her mad impatience It wasa sight to move a heart of flint to seeher as with streaming eyes and convulsive sobs she threw herself from hersaddle and reckless of them all kneltand gathered Randys unconscious headto her bosom cooing over him cryingover him praying orcr him beggingfor one word of love and pardon thenshowering- tears ad kisses on his pallid lips There was no crime of whichthe poor child did not accuse herselffor on their hurried way Grafton gravely told her of Randys utter innocenceand of his own culpability Not untilthe radiant sun was nearly an hourhigh did their patient seem to respondto stimulant or caress but at last toher wild joy he opened his eyes a littlemoment looked up in her face whispered Florence sweetheart andthen seemed to drop away into resistless slumberA pretty time we had said Gouldgetting that pair of spoons back toJoses It was an all days job between waiting- for the ambulance andthen finding an easy road for it Butthere at Joses were the spoons condemned to stay four days and nightsat least while the rest of Sedgwicksscouting parties drifted back to thepost and there presumably Florencemade her peace with her lover lordand wept gallons of salt tears as shetold him how wicked wicked wickedshe had been and how penitent she wasand how severely punished thoughnever so severely as she deserved Shewould listen to no condoning- words ofMrs Hayne She flung- herself into herfathers arms when white faced andten years aged he reached her at theranch and told him what a fiend shehad been and what an angel Randy astatement the captain could not entirely indorse for he went back to the cantonment at the end of the week confident still that there must have beensomething in Randys conduct to undermine the faith of such an unusual girlas his Brownie But he did not say soi t would have done no g oodAnd her stoiy was very simple Neariug the ranch earl y in the first afternoon she saw a party of horsemen riding in toward it and in her half -crazedstate she believed them troops from thepost Randys men So she turnedscpiare to the ncrth and rode for thefoothills She had a little store of provisions and some wine in the large saddle-pouchand only then discoveredthat her bag was gone She could rideaway round the ranch find Mon Abriand hide there during the night Shehad her Navajo blanket Mignon wouldhave grass and water What more couldarmy girl ask in that warm and rainlessregion Before sunset she had foundthe romantic little spot unsaddled andpicketed Mignon and later moved herfarther down stream for fresh grassand then wearied she herself slept forhours and when she awoke and wouldhave pushed on to the cantonment loJ Mignon was gone Florence had heardno sound She could not account for it- - - -Gathered Handy3 unconscious head on herbottomShe could only sit and brood and thinkand then as the long long day thesecond day drew to its close prayheaven for Randys coming Theremore surely than anywhere else if heloved her his love would lead himWhat days of jubilee there were atSedgwick when at last Randy was convalescent enough to be moved and theambulance brought him back throughthe same old hole in the fence Florence seated by his side Another patient was out on a piazza farther downthe row taking the sweet fresh air andlistening languidly to the purring- ofMinturn who still worshiped at theshrine deserted by Whittaker Undeniably sallow looked the Widow McLane and her ejes gazed but languidlyat the joyous little cortege entering thewestward end of the road Capt andMrs Grafton the Haynes and othersympathizing- friends had flockedthither to welcome the fugitives andso it happened that there was no oneat home but Mrs McLane and a muchperturbed young- battery officer togreet two somewhat dusty civilianswho had just driven out from the junction and now slowly ascended theGraftons steps One Mr Parrycame jauntily forward The other amutton chop

of her exasperating brother-in-lawand read no hope but even fromthe depth of her despond sprang- something of her old time coquetry as shelanguidly lay back in the easy chairand extended a slender be jeweled handto the adoring Swinburne The batteryman bowed stiffly and pulled at hismustache in recognition of this new arrival and Ned Parry almost audiblychuckled his enjoyment of the situation Then stable call sounded anddrew the warrior away and left thefield in the hands of the civilian andthen Tarry decided he must join thegang at Merriams and there presently he was patting Randy on the backand showing symptoms of a desire tokiss Mrs Randys hand as he did MrsGraftons Mrs Grafton hurried outdeclaring she must go and ordermore dinner whereat Parry followedher to the gate and called a

lequire banks to pay tax to thefull value of statements that show to theutmost traction of a cent the actual bookvalue of evei ythiug they claim to haveis grossly intquitable and unfair andyet this is what the Council mean whenthey say the banks must pay taxes likeother people and thee proceed to tryto force them to pay more than twice asmuch as other people on the same value of taxable assetsThe Council should not make the mistake of supposing the people of Parishave not intelligence enough to understand the difference between the waythe individual tax payer and the bankgive in their pi operty The individualjustifies himself in concealing 25 to 50per cent of his caxable assets and givingin the balance just as low as will passmuster on the ground that every bodyelse does the same The bank must under heavy penalty show up the utmostpenny Yet the Council and Board ofSapervisors accept the tax list of the individual and permit them to pay tax onit and it is true he pays his tax dollarfor dollar but on what On what hehas given in and on the values ai whichit is assessed Nothing would please thebanks so well as to be allowed to paydollar for dollar on the same kind ofvaluation To talk of other people being compelled to pay dollar for dollar and the banks wanting the Councilto accept 70 per cent from them is certainly not expected to influence intelligent people for all such are fullyaware that when the banks offer to pay70 per cent o f the assets shown by theirstatements they are offering to pay morein proportion to their abets than anycitizen in the communityThe proposition of the banks to pay70 per cent valuation of thnir assets for97 and 98 was a fair and jnat proposition and the Conncil should have accept-AwardedIf diphest Honors Worlds FairCREAMnmmr MOST

including the men in thebanks and the banks themselvesshall stand on an equal footingin the matter of tax paying and it desires to live at peace with the institutionsthrough which its citizens transact theirbusinessThe people of Paris desire that theirbanks remain strong and safe as wellthat their interests which are largely inthe keeping of the banks may be secureas also that the accommodations whichare necessary for carrying on their business may be the more easily obtainedand because with the wise providence ofbusiness men who know that the citywill need revenues in the future as wellas today they desire that the capital ofthe banks may be held intact for the future needs of the city In a word business men understand that this is not theonly year Paris will need to collect taxes and that for the sake of a few hundred dollars more this year it is not thepart of wisdom to force the withdrawalof bank capital from future taxationFour hundred and fifty thousand dollars have already tbeen withdrawn andthe hostile and uncompromising attitudeof the Conncil in demanding the lastdrop of blood and appealing to thecourts to give it to them can scarcely failto enforce further withdrawals of capital as the only means by which thebanks can protect themselves from therapacity of the tax gathererIs there wisdom in forcing such analternative Is this a sensible and capable administration of the peoples interests To say nothing of the banks hasthe tax payer no rights in this matterthat deserve consideration Has he notthe right to expect that the Council willnot injure him and increase his tax forthe future by insisting upon a policywhich besides being unfair and unjustmust ineyitably decrease materially theaggregate of assets from which the future revenues of the city must be derivedThe News feels no personal interestin this controversy other than thatwhich every tax payer and every citizenwho has the future as well as the present interest of the city at heart shouldfeel It desires to see this matter settledfairly and justly because it believes it tobe in the interest of every citizen ofParis that it should be so settledThe banks are a necessity The business of the city could not be transactedwithout them They are perfectly willing to bear their just share of all necessary burdens and no more than thatshould be expected or required of themA Republican ViewThe following is a re print in part ofan editorial in the Paris Reporter Republican under the caption By LawsThe discussi in of the Bank tax question led us to investigate the qualifications of members of the City Councilaid incidentally to look up some ofthe history of a couple of that bodyPage 4 of the By laws and Ordinanceset t e City of Paris defines the qualifications of members of that honorablebody It reads ihus Members ofthe Council shall be qualified voters inthe city residents of the ward forwhich they stand for at least sixmonths prior to the election shall holdno other civil offic nor be directly orIndirectly interested in any contractwith said city the absence of any ofthese qualifications shall render a person inelligible as a member of suchboard and it snail be the duty of theCouncil to sp declare and to proceed tofill such vacancy should any officer ofsaid city be directly or indirectly interested as agent or principal in anycontract with said city he shall therebyvacate his office and the contract entered into before said officer vacateshis office shall be null and voidWe have called attention to thesevery rigid utterances to discuss the attitude of Messrs Remington and AshbrookLast spring the ity undertook to revise and adopt a set of ordinances Awholly useless and unneccessary undertaking Mr Ashbrook was paid thesum of 200 for compiling said ordinances thereby vacating his office forunder the ordinances he could not recieve pay as Councilman nor as attorney Furthermore the city has inits employ as attorneys the firm ofRogers Moore who certainly oughtto have performed this service MrRemington was paid about 175 toprint publish etc these rehashedCynthiana ordinances He was directly interested inthe printing contract and thereby if words mean anything forfeited his officeIf these two members have by theact vacated there offices the ordinances and other acts performed bythem would necessary be voidNow there may have been the usualdodging and winking and tend like bywhich these gentlemen did not -con-tractbut a court ought to be askedto pass upon these things unless ourview is altogether at fault Mr Ash-matt r with legal polish is nil underthe ban We call attention U thematter as they are of public interestand n full and fre di ciiMon or themis within the province of legitimatejournalismThe 500 retainer has already be npaid Mr Ash brook for ihe services heis to render in the Bank tax casesThere seems to have been undue andsuspicious hustle in c Heeling this retainer Mr Ashbrook was perhapsafraid that the Council might changeits mind so he nailed it downIt is rumored that there ill be noone elected from the firM wad to fillthe vacancy made by the resignationof Mr Ashbrook Now unless themembers want to appear perfectlyreckless and indifferent to outward appearances they should act otherwiseThe tampering with such matters isnot of good vepul3 An honest business man should be electedSarcasmUnder the heading A Tribute theMillersburg Gazette quotes a paragraphfrom the Kentuckian Citizen and comments a part of which is reprinted belowNow as to employing Mr Ashbrookto assist

at our siiccess Wemight have retreated then I think butno one gave the wordIn five minutes it was too late Aregiment to an army is as a fly to ahorse Our resistance simply annoyedWe saw a force

curious fact which for many yearshas proved a bone of contention amongscientific men has just been decidedSportsmen and naturalists when hunting in India and Africa have from timetotime had brought under their noticethe horns of various species of deer andbuffalo which have been more or lessperforated by insects On careful examination it was found that the littlecreatures which tunneled and madetheir home in the hard fiber of the hornwere the caterpillars or larvae of amoth belonging to the same family asthe common and all too familiarclothes mothFrom their diminutive size the mothsbelonging to this family have receivedthe name of tineidae and it has beenobserved that they are all more or lessgiven to making their homes in strangeplaces during the larval stage of theirexistence The little larvae of our oldenemy the clothes moth for instancemake for themselves protective cylinders out of the cloth they so greedilycevourSometimes these tubes present a verycurious appearance owing to their having been enlarged as the insect hasgrown and different colored materialsused for the new portions of the oldcase The larvae of another bi anch ofthis family deck themselves out withfloral garments the calyx of the flowerof the common marjoram being- a verylopular dress while others are of amining disposition and love to excavace elaborate tunnels in the leaves ofthe honeysuckleStrange as these habits appear it isyet more wonderful that a species ofrhese soft bodied insects should be capable of boring into so hard a substanceas the antlers of a deer During the 45or 50 years that these horn devouringlarvae have been under observation thevarious stages of their existence havebeen carefully noted from the layingof the egg upon the horn by the mothermoth to the final appearance of her offspring as perfect male and female insectsThe larvae on emerging from theegg bore down into thehorn and whenthey have eaten their fill and are readyfor their chrysalis sleep they tunnelup to the surface so that they mayhave a convenient exit by which tomake their escape when the pupal sleepis over and they have become perfectmothsBut although so much of their lifehistory was known there still remainedone problem unsolved This knottyquestion was that no one knew for certain whether these larvae attacked thehorns and antlers of the buffalo andceer while the animals were alive oronly after death After manj years ofspeculation and conflicting opinions ithas at last been conclusively provedthat these insects do infest the hornsof living quadrupeds for both ths larvae and chrysalis have been taken tfomthe horns within an hour of the cteathof the animal to which they belongedLondon WorldPOWER OF IMAGINATIONUnder Great Xervous ExcitementSometimes Produces Physical FrenzyThe fact that the throes of the imagination under great nervous excitement often produce a correspondingphysical frenzy was illustrated recently in the case of a man who had gone tosleep with his artificial teeth in hismouth Waking suddenly with a choking sensation he found his teeth haddisappeared He lookedin the glass ofwater where they were usually deposited did not see them there and realized that they must be far down histhroat Choking and struggling hehammered on the door of a friend sleeping in the house who seeing his critical condition -vainly endeavored todraw the teeth out of the sufferersthroat He could feel the teeth but hadnot the strength to extricate themHe ran for a blacksmith who lived afew doors away but the blacksmithshand was too big to

wasbrought under the impression that hersmall hand might reach the obstacleand withdraw it but she got frightened and began to cry The suffererbecame black in the face his throatswelled out and his

agriculturallaborers are at work in the fields untildarkness comes The last load is oftencarried by moonlight For both farmers and laborers the harvest time is agood time For the laborers it meansany amount of overtime at overtimeprices and from June to Septemberhundreds of thousands of English laborers nearly double thur wages andput together the savings which are tocarry them and their families withcomfort through the winter when theworking days are short and wages notas high as when farm labor is in greatdemandJourneying through rural Englandjust when the crops are being carriedone cannot fail to notice two featuresabout English fields that are missing inAmerican fields One of these is theextent to which English fields are cutup by public footpaths The other isthe studding of the fields which havebeen cleared of hay with stiff thornbushes cut from the hedges The footpaths date back to centuries whenfarming land was not so valuable norso closely cultivated as it is to dayFarmers do not like these footpathsNor do landlords like them either Fora field with a footpath across it commands Jess rent than one that is eonvpletcly inclosed But in England once afootpath always a footpath Even therailways have to accept this usage asanyone can sec- by the frequency ofoot bridges across the lines in ruralEngland As regards the studding ofnewly mown fields with stiff thornsthat too for American readers has anexplanation which is not without interest It is done only in game countries and the object of the thorns setup with great frequency in the fieldsis to prevent poachers from draggingthem at night with nets Whereverthis studding of the fields with hawthorn stakes occurs it is proof thatgame preserving is carried on in theneighborhood and that the gamekeepers expect trouble from their inveterateenemies the poachersAs one nears the larger towns especially the towns which are great railway centers it is is easy to j ee how fondthe English town workmen pi the midlands is of a bit of land and how in thetwiligt of the summer evening hebusies himself with his allotment Heis usually at work in his allotment byhalf past six After leaving work heallows himself about an hour to crethome take supper and smoke a pipeand- then off he goes to his gardenpatch Oftentimes his wife and childrengo with him and there they stay allmore or less at work until darknessdrives them home The work is notespecially hard It is done in a leisurely way varied with a little gossip withthe proprietors of neighboring patchesand where a field of 15 or 20 acres is divided into these garden lots the sceneon a summer evening is about as pleasing as any scene which presents itselfin a journey through the MidlandsIt is curious that these garden patchscenes are more common in the midlands than in the north of EnglandThey are seldom seen on the outskirtsof the woolen and cotton factory townsof Yorkshire and Lancashire Thev invariably occur however in the neighborhood of a railway center in the midlands where a great railway companyhas established its locomotive works orits car factories I think this is due tothe fact that railway artisans andworkmen are recruited mostly in therural districts and transplanted as itwere to the towns while the factoryoperatives of Yorkshire and Lancashireare townbred men with no strong attachment to the land The English socialists somethnes condemn the allotment system Thej argue that if a manadds to his earnings by working in anallotment in his sjiare time his employer will note his added prosperity andsoon offer him less wages But whatever there may be in this socialistic argument the allotment system thrivesin the outskirts of the large towns inthe midlands and it certainly adds tothe picturesqueness

SanMarcos RanchThe greatest cowboy steer in theworld has his home on the San Marcosranch near Santa BarbaraBy some people he is simply called atrained steer by others a cavrestoBut as he does the hardest kind of cowboy work and a good deal of a naturethe cowboys cannot do it would seemas if the Texas name cowboy steer isthe most appropriateOn every well regulated cattle ranchin the west there is at least one steertrained to help the cowbo3 s in theirwork But there is none as proficientin his business as the one on the SanMarcos ranchThe cowbojs have named this fellowEl Hey the king and he is certainlydeserving of the titleHe holds his title and his throne bythe power of brain and muscle Themany manifestations of extraordinaryintellect exhibited by dogs and trainedhorses are surprising enough in themselves but they dwindle into commonplace when one considers the peculiaraccomplishments of the cavresto ElHey The fierceness of wild cattle issimply appallingThe credit for the conquering andeducation of El Key is due entirely tothe pluck and patience of a vaqueronamed Louis Ruiz And when his labors were finished a wonderful workhad been accomplished From thewildest and most vicious of them all ElKey had become as docile and obedientas a dogAs Ave all know the ordinary cavrestois trained when the riata has capturedone of the bellowing plunging maddened animals to range himself alongside the captive and permit the vaqueroto secure him firmly to the horns of thecaptive by means of the riataWhen the rodeo takes place thesetrained animals are sent into the denseundergrowth and forests to rout outthe hiding and terrified cattle Eventhe cowboys strong and skilled asthey are would never be able to drivethem into the open country But withthe best of the cavrestos a great dealof prodding pushing and swearing isconsidered necessary to make themperform their dutiesWith El Rev all is different At theword of command he is off through thethickets driving from their hidingplaces the stubborn cattle He waitsfor no riata Locking his own bigstrong and crooked horns into thehorns of his indignant brother hehauls and tugs and pulls until victoryis his Many and fierce are his fightsWild is his rage when after a terrificstruggle with victory almost in reachthe captive succeeds in slipping fromthe terrible crook of El Keys horns anfldashes off once more to the chaparraland freedom But the wild steers liberty is short lived El Key never falters in his pursuit and never returnsexcept in company with his strugglingprisonerHaving brought in his captive ElKey resolutely stands by and holds himwith his horns till he is identifiedbranded marked killed or whateverthe cattlemen elect to do with the animal All the while the captive is heldsteadily and stoutly till the cattlemenhave finished and El Key is ordered tollet goPerhaps the most remarkable thingis the coolness with which El Kevstands quietly holding down the headof the captured animal while the vaquero deftly touches a knife to the captives throat The sight of blood doesnot seem to affect him in the leastWhen one of the refractory cattle isbrought in by a cavresto he is immediately thrown to the ground and hishind legs are securely tied together bythe strong riata His head is helddown by the trained steer and it is thenthe executioner operatesThe ordinary cavresto does not likethe opeiation of holding another steerto be killed He would willingly getaway if he could but he is usually tootightly bound and must play his part tothe end But El Key needs no riata tocompel him to do his duty With histerrible horns locked of his own accord into the horns of his captive hestands a sturdy and interested participant until the gleaming knife of thevaquero lets the life blood

ItoadsIt may be seriously questionedwhether any country that can beclassed among the civilized nations cfthe earth can show such poor wagonroads as the United States uniess it txRussia and the smaller principalities ofsoutheastern Europe The early settlements in the United States were mainlyalong the banks of navigable watersand the steam railway came so soonafter commerce developed between thegrowing towns that the roads whichhad in some cases been started wereneglectedIn Europe wagon roads were constructed long before the introductionof steam and conditions there haiemade it necessary to maintain and develop them It is only within ten yearsthat America has begun to learn howmuch she loses from the present badcondition of her highways and is at lastbeginning to set about improvementsin earnestAt present the condition of Cuba isattracting much attention We already see the losses that have been entailed there by the absence of anythingthat can be called a road and we willrealize much more fully in a short timewhat decent highways mean to a country when they begin to be opened upin the long dormant ex Spanish islandsand their many resources are developedAmerica is entering upon a period ofincreased activity in commerce andmanufacture She has lately beenforced into unexpected relations withthe other powers of the world Distantoutlets are demanded for our productions and more perfect facilities athome for their preparation Successful competition in the great marketsof the world means that all classes athome must enjoy prosperity and develop conditions of the greatest possible efficiency and to accomplish thisnothing is more important than thebest means of transportation and perfect intercommunication among allsections of the country over firm highways Good RoadsSIMPLE FEED RACKHandy Device When CalvoJLaiabs Have the Run of cSmall Lot or YardandIt is the little things that make farmlife a pleasure and when right - employed also profitable Thereforewhen lambs and calves have the runof a small yard or lot near the bavn allto themselves as during summer andfall they often do nothing is more practical than setting up for them a feedrack such as is exhibited herewith inthe illustrationAs can be seen it is cheap very simple of construction and is easil3T movedfrom one place to another In makingit all that is required are narrowstrips of boards sawed in properlengths and held in place with plentyof nails Indeed the uprights at theends should be nailed very firmly to tharack and have their lower ends sharpened so that they can be driven into theground wherever it is desirable to set upthe rack as is representedThus arranged hay grass corn fodder or any other material of a similarnature can be placed in the rack andfed with impunity Why Because isZ sZzt laics1 nHANDY FEEDING DEVICEis held up out of the way of dirt anOdust and all the little animals have todo is simply to pull it out and eat it aadesired only a very small percentagebeing wasted in their so doingPlace such a rack as this in the shadeof a good tree or the barn and thenload it and calves or lambs can eatand enjoy it to their hearts contentduring the hot dry days of late summerand early autumn As treatment ofthis nature helps them much to getseasoned to meet the better the hardships of winter it ought never to beneglected Frederick O Sibley in NY TribuneCalves Running with CiwsAt this season of the year when cattle are allowed to run in the bariryardstogether it is often a question whetherit is advisable to allow spring calvesto run in the same yards with theirdams still giving milk Wc neverfound any such trouble Sometimesthe calf will remember the suckinghabit and may try to get near the cowto suck But almost invariably thecow will drive the calf away Cows atthis season do not give enough milkto cause pressure on their bags anda six-months-old calf is more apt ifit tries to suckle to hurt the cow thanto relieve her It is well howeverto watch the cow and calf togetherThe cow will plainly show thatshe remembers her offspring but evidently sees that it is able to take careof itself without suckling her for itsfood American

Against the Vessel inHavana BaySix bulls were killed during the dayOur party arrived as the first one wasbeing hauled away dead After thefifth bull had been dispatched it wasdecided as a considerate measure infavor of Gen Parfado that Ave shouldleave the building and return to Havana early so as to avoid the crowdWe therefore left very quietly just before the sixth bull entered the ringWe tried to reach the terry promptlyso that we might return to Havana ona steamer having but few passengersThree members of our party were successful in this attempt but Gen LeeLieut Holman and I failed On our arrival a steamer had just left the landing We then hailed a small passenger boat and were pulled to the MaineWhile Gen Lee and I were conversingon the quarter deck of the Maine af err3rboat came across the bay carryingback to Havana a large number of people from the audience There was nodemonstration of any kind The passengers were doubtless those who hadleft early hoping like ourselves toavoid the crowdThe next ferryboat was denselycrowded Among the passengers werea number of officers of the Spanisharmy and of the volunteers As theferryboat passed the Maine there werederisive calls and whistles Apparently not more than 50 people participatedin the demonstration It was not general and might have occurred anywhere I have never believed that theSpanish officers or soldiers took partIt is but fair to say that this was theonly demonstration of any kind madeagainst the Maine or her officers eithercollectively or individually so far aswas made known to me during ourvisit Adverse feeling toward us wasshown by the apathetic bearing- of soldiers when they saluted or of tradesmen when they supplied our needsAfter the Maine had been sunk andwhen the Montgomery and the Fernwere in Havana Spanish passengerboatment exhibited bad temper bywithholding or delaying answers to ourhails at night The failure of the Span-ish authorities to compel the boatmento answer our hails impressed me as being very closely akin to active unfriendliness It was at the time when VheYizcaja and the Oquendo were in Havana using picket boats and occasionally searchlights at night apparently tosafeguard themselves Hails were milesharply and answered promptly tetween the Spanish men-of-war and theboats constantly plying about the harbor at night It must have been plainon boaixl the Spanish men-of-war thStthe boatmen were trifling with us Thiiwas after the Vizcaya had visited NewYork Capt Charles D Sigsbee inCenturyREMEDY FOR HOG CHOLERADonkeys Used Chiefly for Preparing-the Immune Serum An vportant DiscoveryAfter experiments extending over aXjeriod of 20 years and the expenditureof many thousands of dollars theUnited States government is at lastcombating successfully those most pernicious diseases hog cholera and swineplague The results obtained by thebureau of animal industry of the agricultural department especially duringthe last year have been highly satisfactory and the scientists who havedevoted so much time and labor to thawork feel amply repaid for their effortsThe discovery of a serum which renders hogs immune from the ravages ofcholera and plague is an important oneIt means a great deal to one of the foremost American industries and thebenefits arising from it are almost incalculable The propagation of the serum requires the use of many animalsAt the experiment station where it ismaae there are donkeys cows calvesmuless and horses all patiently submitting co the process of inoculation andblood drawing Strange as it may appear not a single hog is used in makingthe antitoxin fluid which is such ablessing to his familj Hogs have notbeen found well adapted to the purposefor which the government uses otheianimals Donkeys are the favoriteswith the experimentersThe station at Bethesda Mil eightmiles from Washington is a uniqueinstitution On the well kept farmthere are dozens of horses and limitsthat are strangers tothe plow and harness There are cows whose days forgiving milk are over and whose lives inthe eyes of the scientists are devotedto higher objects The farm is presided over by Dr Ernest C Schroedera man who although still young hasmade a name in the scientific worldDr IX E Salmon chief of the bureauof animal industry said recentlyWe have used serum on 1000 animalsthis year and have saved over 80 percent of herds treated While the treatment was going on observations weremade of 1100 hogs in other herds nottreated for the lack of serum and 80per cent died Last year the percentage of hogs saved out of 240 treated was75 while in other herds not treated 85per cent died Y SunThe Sensitive Harvest FistiTwo harvest fishp taken in GraveBend bay recently hrve now been keptin the New York aquarium for morethan a week The

SchoolsThe annual report of the Dawes Indian commission bringing the work oithat body in reorganizing Indian territory up to date has been made public It urges as the main call for government aid fraught with disastrousconsequeuses if delayed the need Gilsome provision by the national government for educational purposes in theterritory While the funds and resources of the several tribes properljmanaged can probably supply sufficient support for the schools of thecitizen Indians yet the white residentscannot share in them and must lookelsewhere for the moans of educatingheir children The means resorted tcin all the other territorities and outof which ample school funds have beenprovided do not exist in the Indian territorj in which the United States hasnot an acre of public land or other property beyond that in public uses If thewhite residents are to receive any aidfrom the United States it must be fromthe outside and by direct appropriationIf they are left without any such aidit will be a harsher treatment than hasbeen meted out to the residents of anyother territory and will be attendedwith the most disastrous consequencesThere are believed to be between 250000 and 300000 white residents in theterritory to day and well nigh 30000 olthem children of school age They arethere to stay making homes for themselves and destined to be a part of thebody politic of a state While some ofthem living in the towns are anxious toeducate their children and may be ableto some extent to do so from theirprivate means yet it is quite differentwith the poor pioneers in the countrywho constitute by far the larger partof this white population They however anxious cannot of themselvescommand the means or the opportunityto educate their children Consequently a very large proportion of this 30000 children of school ages increasingin number every year are in danger ofgrowing up in ignorance to take uponthemselves the responsibilities of citizenship This is not the fault
