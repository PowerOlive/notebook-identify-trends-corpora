Mr. Patterson was born near More
nead, in Rowan county, and was one
of a large family. He became en
gaged Jn farming, to which he devot
ed his entire attention-. Early in life
ie moved from Morehead to Mason
county, where, he -continued farmingt
or the-past thirty-five years he has
3jeen a resident of the Millersburg
.-
vicinity. He was married many
years ago to Miss Elizabeth Fizer,
who survives him. Mr. Patterson
was a life-long member of the Mil

the time of his death was an officer
in the congregation.
He is survived by his widow, one

Stone, Pike county, Mrs. Harlan Par
ris, of Lexington, Mrs. James Hill,
and Miss Christine Patterson, of Mil

The funeral will be held at the
Methodist church in this city Sunday
afternoon at two o'clock, with ser
vices conducted by his pastor, Rev.
J. W. Gardner, assisted by Tf. C. C.
Fisher, of the Millersburg College.
The interment will take place on the
family lot in the Millersburg Ceme
term. Mr. A. H. Smedley, aged 65, sui
cided Tuesday at 11:00 a. m. by
shooting nimself in the heart in the
bath room of Dr. C. B. Smith, with
whom he was residing. For some
time Mr. Smedley had been in fail
ing health, and had brooded much
over his condition, but not being of
a dispondent nature, neither the fam
ily or his friends were prepared for
the shock of Tuesday morning.
He arose Tuesday morning about
his usual time, and was in good
spirits. After breakfast he mingled
with friends for a time ,on the
streets, remarking that he had slept
well the night before, and was not so
nervous. About 9:30 h6 Returned to
the home of Dr. Smith) and was
whistling at he entered the house.
For a time he sat on the veranda and
read a paper. About 10:30 a. m. he
went to the bath room, where the
fatal shot was fired. The shot was
not heard by any member of the
family, as they were out of the house
at the time.
A few minutes.later his niece,xMrs.
H. C. Current, entered the home and
went upstairs. - On approaching the
second floor she detected the odor of
gunpowder and immediately returned
to the first floor, where she communi
cated the news to her mother, who
did not think seriously of it. On go
ing to the second floor again, she
found that she could not enter the
bath room. The alarm was given and
an entrance soon effected, when the
lifeless body of Mr. Smedley was
found. Coroner Rudolph Davis was
immediately summoned, and was soon
on the scene. Av verdict was rendered
according to the above facts.
Mr. Smedley was one of the best
known men in Central Kentucky,
having been a prominent figure both
in business and social circles. When
quite a young man he held the posi
tion of salesman for his brother, Mr.
J. G. Smedley, dealer in dry goods in
Millersburg. Later he conducted a
gents' furnishing establishment in
the property now occupied by Jones
Brothers as a grocery. After this he
went to S't. Louis, Mo., where he con
ducted a shoe establishment for a
number of years. On returning to
Kentucky, he and his brother, Brodis
Smedley, purchased ' a farm near
Hutchison, which they operated until
the death of his brother, Brodis
Smedley, about five years ago. He
then came to Millersburg to reside
with his brother, Mr. J. G. Smedley,
and since the death of his brother,
which occurred in 1917, he has re
sided in the -same home with his
nephew, Dr. and Mrs. C. B. Smith.
He was a bachelor and one of a
large family of children, all of whom
have preceded him to the grave, ex
cept one sister, Mrs. Kate Forrester,
of Chicago, 111.. For many years he
has been a member of the Baptist
church, holding his membership at
Paris. He was a brilliant man, well
informed on all subjects, a reader
and thinker, gentle in disposition,
not easily to disturb, and devoted to
his nieces and nephews. His elder
brother, Mr. William Smedley, died a
few months ago. This seemed to af
fect his life. At times he suffered
severe nervous attacks, but was
bright and cheerful when they pass
ed away.
' The funeral was held Thursday at
2:30 p. m. from the residence of Dr.
C. B. Smith, services conducted by his
i pastor, Rev. R. G. Goldsmith, of the
Paris Baptist church. Interment on
j the family lot by the side of his par
J ents and other members of the family
i in the Carlisle Cemetery. The floral
' tributes were numerous and beauti
ful.
The pall-bearers were C. W. Cor
rington, William Meteer, W. D. Wa
dell, T. H. Smith, B. M. Johnson and
