MILLERSBURG ITEMS.
' The foot ball team of the M. M. I.
.is probanly one of the best lightweight
teams in the Blue Gras&, weighing a
scant 135 pounds, tbey have twice
imet teams from 10 to 20 pounds more
to the man and so far their goal line
has never been crossed, a record which
very man is trying to keep up. The
best material for years presented
itstlf this fall and this combined with
some of the best men of last year's
team made the outlook seem especially
promising.
Just now the team is much handicap
ped from the lack of a coach, owing to J
the resignation of Captain Henderson
who had charge, but every man has
pledged his best efforts and ihey in
tend to make this season a successful
one by themselves. The fact that the
team is captained by Cadet Gentry,
one of the best players M. M. I. has
ever known, is largely responsible for
their success. He seems to manage
the team more easily and be able to
set more out tf the men than the av
erage captain.
McClure at center plays a fine game,
always sending the ball to the right
spot and making splendid interference.
The two guards, Hertel and Oldham,
are always in the game and play fine
ball both when on the offensive and
defensive. Blackburn at tackle plays
a strong game and made unusual gains
in the game with Georgetown. Of
Gentry, the other tackle, enough has t
been aid to show that his playing is
excellent in every way. Kash and
Wiggles worth on the ends are as good
.a pair as there is on the team. Their
' interference is masterful and their
work on the defense is without a par.
Eenind the lines the splendid pair of
backs, Rice and Wigglevvsorth, "are
there with the goods" in every sense
of the word but their work is not
superior to Han is at full, who plays a
fine game. And now last but by no
means least, we come to the brains of
the team, Miller, the quarterback,
who at all times displays keen judg
ment in directing the plays and who is
wonderfully quick, making sensational
gains whenever he runs with the ball.
Following is the complete schedule
for the rest of the season : October 30

Bold Thief Raids Corn Crib.
After breaking the lock on a corn
crib in the barn of M. J. Murphy on
dast High street Sunday night a bcld
thief made away with several sacks of
corn, and in an effort to catch the
thief Mr. Murphy called on Capt. V.
K. Mullikin, of Lexington, who came
ever with his bloodnounds, but the
dops failed to catch the criminal.
For several weeks Mr. Murphy has
been missing corn from his crib, and
is of the opinion the thief or thieves in
that length of time have stolen up
wards of forty bushels of the grain.
Patrol or an Link, who about a week
ago was successful in capturing two
negroes who had been taking feed
from the stabe of J. U. Boardman.Jhas
been keeping a close watch around the
premises of Mr. Murphy, but Sunday
night illness prevented his going en
duty.
Capt. Mullikin, Kith his two hounds,
arrived here yesterday morning on the
9 o'clock car and took the dogs to the
scene of the robbery. The dogs took
a trail which led from stable through
the open lot adjoining the city hall and
to the old rock quarry in the rear of
the residence of Mrs. Lizzie Walker,
across the lot adjoining to a point near
the Overby tobacco barn where the
trail was lost.
