CottonNew Yobk May 10 To demonstratethe possibility of using gun cotton inshells fired by powder without dangerthere was a test at the Sandy Hookproving grounds Tuesday which resulted satisfactorily to the governmentofficials It will require at least twodays to determine whether or not thetest was a success from a scientificstandpoint The expeiment was madewith a Gathman fuse with a sufficientquantity of powder to burst the gunfrom which the charge of gun cotton wasfired Small quantities of unexplodedgun cotton were found after the testHeretofore the drawback in discharging gun cotton with the aid of powderhas been the danger of a prematureexplosion The Gathman fuse is madeto operate and explode the cotton by asystem whose success depends uponthe revolving motion of the shell Toexplode the shell must be fired from agun with a rifle bore simple concussion not being sufficient to do itThe test was made with a15 inch Rodman gun weighing 49000pounds 16 feet in length the walls ofthe gun being 164 inches in diameterThe gun was placed in a pit 15 feetdeep after 100 pounds of fine smokeless powder had been rammed hometo be used to discharge the phosphorbronze shell containing S2 pounds of 32percent wet gun cotton The Gathmanfuse contained 9 1 0 ounces of dry guncotton and 35 grains of fulminate ofmercuryThe charge of powder was an excessive one and was for the purpose ofbursting the gun without explodingthe gun cotton The bore of the gunwas filled with wet sand the gun covered with sand and timber the pitfilled in with sand and a mound ofthe same material five feet highwas built making the depth ofthe gun 18 feet An electricwire connected with the gun Therewas an upheaval of sand and timber60 feet in the air and the huge holewas torn in the sand A dozen piecesof the Rodman gun which had burstinto small pieces were found in thesand and also some small pieces ofunexploded gun cottonWhen an examination was made of apiece of the muzzle of the gun it wasfound that the inner side near themuzzle was coated with phosphorbronze from the shell and the belief isthat the shell was partly dislodgedandat least reached the muzzle of the gunbefore the shell burst The officialswho were making the test found thepressure gauge of the gun but it wasso badly twisted and bent that it wasimpossible to tell the force of the dischargeA score of laborers were set to workto dig down to the pit where it is believed a large mass of the unexplodedgun cotton will be found It will besome days before the task will be accomplishedAmong those who witnessed thetest was Rr Adm Charles ONeil chiefordnance officer of the United StatesnavyTHE INDUSTRIAL COMMISSIONS B Donnelly President of the International Typograpical Union Given aHearing TuesdayWashington

papers in Havanacame out Wednesday with an editorialstrongly indorsing the American administration Its utterances are regarded as representing the best thoughtof the thinking element of the community The editorial says in partIf any shadow of doubt could remainas to the absolutely imperious necessityof the expulsion of old Spanish regimein order that Cuba might have trueliberty and progress it must vanishwhen one analyses the seriesof phenomena developed before oursight day by day We are eliminatingtraditional impediments and gettingrid of the apparently impassable obstacles which four centuries of eviltraining in political administrationhad thrown in our pathLa Patria goes on to contrast theAmerican method with that of theobstinate Spanish in dealing witheven the simplest reformsOn this point it saysFormerly there was agitation amongthe people oceans of ink and tons olpaper were used floods of oratorywere poured out and then every thingended at Madrid in the froth of Spanish promises On the other hand inthese days of fruitful thoughsilent work we learn of themost radical forms when theyKre published in the Official Gazettewithout being preceded by a magnificent conglomeration of orato andcolored fire An order of six lineswith a very short preamble will represent some bold and beneficent measureI might say that for us a thin sheet ofpaper separates the medieval worldfrom the 19th century and oftentimesthe writing is not indispensable to enable us to pass from darkness to lightAs an illustration of its argumentLa Patria cites the separation ofchurch and state and draws a pictureof the wild parliamentary scenesthat would have occurred if sue i asubject had been agitated in the 13thcenturyYet this has been accomplished itsays by the Americans and throughthis a thousand enormities have beeneffacedSenor Perfecto LaCoste mayor ofHavana with the approval of MajGen Ludlow will issue a decree prohibiting the wearing of undershirtsexposed that is

Unfortunatelyit is beyond ray power It was all awhirl and a maze of figures and theputting in and breaking of clouds ofimoke and beyond that little but someclattering of swords and guns andmuch jostling about 1 was not in thefront rank and could only step thisway and that as my companions advanced or retreated and beyond oncedischarging my gun did no actuallighting it was soon over and I sawthat the enemy had brokenAfter them and take some prisoners Morgan roaredI was immediately left in a littleclear space with only Mr Tym andMac lvrach near at hand The othershad made a dash after the ikying SpaniardsMy two companions like myselfwere unhurt In this respect theywere more fortunate than 20 or so ofour mates Nine or ten of these werekilled outright and the others weredoubled up with pain or sitting aboutbloody and bewilderedThe smoke gradually thinned outand I looked toward the city I sawthe Spaniards slowly but doggedly retreating stopping at intervals towheel and fire a desultory volley Ouradvance men were at their heels butlid not pursue far for having takenfive or six prisoners they let go a parting shot or two and returnedMorgan now harangued us brieflysaying that victory was assuredlywithin our reach and that we had butto put forth one more effort to secureit This speech being well received heleft a guard of 200 with the woundedand also to act as a reserve and ledthe rest to the attack Mr Tym Maclvrach and myself were included inthis assaulting partyWe marched directly toward theenemy and at once received their firekilled and sevlosing ten or twelve ineral wounded Then of a sudden Morgan sprang to the right and we wheeling after him he led us almost at a runfrom the road into the meadow I immediately perceived what he woulddo which was to avoid the forts andthis strong front of the town and attack a weaker place To effect this heiiad feigned to make an assault thereby holding the main force of the cneaiy where it wasIt was soft footing and we ranrather heavily but still we were making some progress when the foetrained their cannon on us and thoughwe were in loose formation theybrought down well nisrh a score TheirTHE BOURBON NEWS PA1US KY FRIDAY MAT 12 1899musketeers also made forward andfired and before we had proceeded 20yards farther it seemed that not fewerthan 100 buccaneers were either slainor woundedThis could not last The enemy washaving it all his own way and unlesswe could turn upon him soon he wouldlay us all dead or drive us off the fieldA man in front of me swung out andfell sidewise on the grass A ballstruck the stock of Mac lvrach musket and as I turned my head to makesure that Mr Tym was safe I felt asharp spiteful rap on my own headpiecePaul Cradde was a little way on myright and he had begun to swear whena shout went up from those in frontand with great suddenness the wholecommand came to a halt I saw threeor four of the captains running outinto the field and in a moment theirseveral commands were followingthem and now we were wheeled shortand faced toward the cityA sort of growl of relief and satisfaction went round for at last this playing as living targets was over Welooked to our priming and broughtforward our bandoliersKeep close cried Mr Tym in myear This will be the most desperatebusiness of allWhite arms and pieces of eightroared Paul CraddeAye aye shouted a man near meThe trumpets sounded a quicker noteand we broke into a runI could glance between the headsin front of me and see what sort of placewe were approaching Five or six littlehuts stood out in front some paddocksor cattle yards ran along in the rearand still back of these as a long lowstone building The flat roof of thiswas mounted with cannon and behindthe rails of the paddocks were thecrouching figures of soldiers A troopof horse was drawn up at the rightof the long buildingWe lowered otir heads and madestraight forward Then the enemysdischarge broke and men went crashing down on all sides of me Before thesmoke had lifted we returned 1he fireand were immediately among the littlehuts T threw down my gun and drewrhy sword and fetched a glance aroundfor Mr Tym Tie was not to be seenMac lvrach was a few paces away andthrough the smoke were some other familiar figures I hesitated being tilledwith lively anxiety concerning the supercargo and while I delayed the lastof my companions passed on T glancedhastily about not -really caring to beabandoned and at that moment felta sudden and strange shock I perceived that T had been hit and staggered toward a hut and leaned againstit After a little interval it seemed tome that T made out the shape of ahuman figure breaking through thesmoke I could see but dimly but Ithought the man was PradeyCHAPTER XIVOF THE CONCLUSION OF MY ADVENTURE AND THE FALL OF THE CITYLIKEWISE OF THE STRANGE THINGTHAT HAPPENED THEREAFTERI made a kind of dreamlike effort tocome back to myself and for an instant half succeeded The advancingfigure came out plainer I saw the faceand it was indeed Pradevs 1 struggledto keep it steadily in view but it insisted on swimming in with the puffs ofsmoke and as my giddiness increased itlost all shape and outline I must haveslipped from my position against thehut at this point for things gave akind of upward flash in particular oneobject danced out like a bright piece ofsteel and then I was conscious of ahard jolt and all was blackened outThe next that I am able to recall is agreat swaying and swinging sensationfollowed by an abrupt pause and thena little cold shock I opened my eyesand found a wet cloth on my foreheadthe ends hanging down on my cheeksI put up my hand and drew the clothaway As I cleared my eyes a figureclose by stepped forward and I perceived with joy that it was Mr TymHe was in his fighting gear wantingonly t lie headpiece and seemed to bequite unhurt He smiled as I staredup at himYou arc safe then I saidTo be sure and you also It wasbut n little furrow turned along theskull but might easily have been serious Nay but you had best remainwhere you tire he pursued as I wouldhave risen There is some hea in yourwound and in this weather it were easyto provoke feverI perceived the wisdom of this adviceand settled back in my plaee I glancedabout however and saw that I wasin a sheher made of the rails of oneof the neighboring paddocks coveredwith palm thatch By the brightnessof the sun that came n at the door andthe oppressive heat I gtiessed that itmust be nigh noonMy thoughts seemed now to fall intotheir natural order and I made hasteto question himHow does it happen that I am hereI said and in what manner was I delivered from PradeyI killed the villain he answeredquietly It were best that you didnot talk overmuch now he went onbut to satisfy you I wfll say that Imissed you and t urned back and foundyou wounded ami with Pradey makingin upon you I had scant time butfired and was fortunate enough tosend a ball through Ids head Then Idragged you a bit aside and presentlywas able to secure the aid of one ofthe men when we brought you hitherThis was greet news to be sure inespechil the pari that related toPradey and 1 vas content to remainsilent a moment and reflect upon itThen that villain is gone Surelywe have reason to rejoice I said atlast But how think vou will thej other buccaneers take it Do theyj know the manner of his deathNay and it were best that theyI should not answered Mr Tym lowering his voice Let it seem that hedied in actionTrue said I that will be wiseBut now what of the fortunes of theday It would eeem that we had wonbut in what sort Have we taken thecityWell if you will talk said he shaking his head I trow you may as wellhave the whole story Aje we havebeaten the enemy and taken the cityNevertheless Morgan has for a littlewithdrawn fearing as it is said minespoisoned water and other snares butI think in reality not desiring to trustthe men He will be for waiting tilltheir blood is a little cooled and he canbe sure of obedienceWell said T a little wearily andwithal my head fetching a pang tellme one other thing and I am contentHow has it gone with Mac lvrachNot so much as scratched he answered He was here but a little timeagoI was glad to give over with this andlay for awhile quietly Mr Tym satdown in the door of the hut and beganto care for his arms and I was on theverge of falling asleep Of a suddenthere was a far off noise of shoutingfollowed by a long drawn agonizedscreamWhat I cried starting up has thefiends work begun alreadyIt would seem so he said with asigh I conceive they are puttingsome poor creature to the tortureDoubtless Morgan will have an earlyword concerning treasure and alsoseek to learn of traps and snaresWould that God might blast him andall his foul crew I cried in fiery indignationMr Tym composed his lips as thoughto assent but did not answerI smell smoke 1 said after a littleWill they be burning the townHe stepped to the door of the hut andlooked outay I think not yet a building hereand there is burning Aye one of thecathedrals is ablaze I will trj -learn what it meansHere 1 heard some people hurryingpast and Mr Tym going a little farther out hailed themI could not distinguish what the7said but in a moment he returnedThere are no orders for burningso it is claimed yet four or five considerable buildings including onevII thought it was Pradeydral are in flames Morgan has ordered the people of the town to fightthe fire and some of the buccaneershave been detailed to lend aidThe smoke smells wondrousstrong I observedI think that comes from the burning of a few outlying huts he answered They are but a short spacefrom here Nay they are nigh whereI found youI might have been roasted as wellhad you not searched me out I saidwith a long breath Yet tell me hownear adjacent to the city are weIt is the space where the paddocksstood he answered The men havesulhd the rails down and convertedthem as you see into frames for hutsPhibbert and the man I told you ofhelped me build this onePhibbert is no bad fellow I saidgratefully And as for you trulyhow am I indebted to youSpeak not of it he said lightly Iam indebted to you alsoWe were silent a moment and in theinterval I could hear the confusednoises and cries from the townthough to my vast relief no moreshrieksDo we quarter in the place tonight I finally askedMorgan says no he answered Hewill wait till the morrow Alas and Idread that timeAnd how long will their hells worklast I said despondentlyHe heaved a sigh and began to paceup and down which showed how deeply he was moved though his judgmenttold him it was to no purpose I sighedin response and fell silent my spiritsnot a little depressedIt seemed that Morgan continued tohis resolution to withdraw1 his forcesfrom the city till the next day this excepting only two or three companiesthat should search for any concealedfighting mn and should also seize andman the few ships in the harbor Therest of his command he meant to placeabout the landward part of the citygqardthg it that none should escapeAll this I may sa in a word wasdone Lit tie resistance was offered toour searching party and injVed it wassoon found that the governor andthose of his captains who were unhurtas well as many of the soldiers had incontinently fled So my vengeance andthat of my companions on the haughtyDon Perez de Guzman must at least beput oft1 remained in the hut during theday Indeed the heat was terrible andit would have been a bid for a fever forme to have ventured out Now andthen I went to the hut door and thencej could sec the men extend their lines sowma - to engirdle xlie city cut snci wasthe fervor of the sun that the movement was performed slowly and witha general mien of listlessness At lastit was completed and then a little company was to be seen at short intervalswith guards walking between and atone point Morgans headquarters witha body of two or three score in attendance Mac lvrach had been summonedto take his place with the other guardsleaving Mr Tym and me togetherWhy this latter arrangement wasmade we did not then learnAbout nightfall Mac Iraeh returned having been relieved and thenwe were told that Phibbert had beenehosen captain in place of Pradey andthat it was to his good nature that weowed Mr Tyms exemption from guarddutyNight finally drew on and the watchfires of the guards were lighted Themoon had not yet risen and the mounting flames driven presently by a windfrom the sea flared up with a landward slant and partially obscuredwith clouds of smoke the white wallsof the outlying houses In the direction of the harbor there was a paleradiance showing where the ships anddoubtless the quays had been set offwith prudent lights The city itselfwas nearly quiet Now and then a dogbarked or a horse could be heard galloping along a hard street and once abell rang and we heard the faint sweetsounds of a chant as it might be thepriests were tunefully asking mercy ofGod but

talk of an extra session of congress has more behind it than idle gossip The contingency of such a session has been discussed at a cabinetmeeting and a member of that bodywho was present at the time is authority for the statement that the presidents mind is strongly inclined towards such a moveTwo reasons chiefly control the president in this matter he wishes thepolicy of the government with respectto the Philippines defined and the currency question disposed of before theparty enters the campaign of 1900 Thepresident has declared his belief to hisadvisers that peace will be establishedin the Philippines within the next30 days and that the ownershipand possession of those islands will nolonger be disputed This subject coming to him so soon he does not care toformulate a with respect totheir government the degree of homerule to be granted to them etc without the aid of congress in whose handshe placed the whole subject in hismessage to that bodyThe president is unwilling- to do anything tbat will lessen the presentabundant prospects of success for hisparty in the coming campaign liefears that anything looking like delayor indecision will have a bad effectFor this reason he wants the wholecountry to know before 1900 exactlywhat the policy of the government willbe with respect to possessions in thefar eastAnother powerful controlling motive that is actuating the president ishis strong desire to have early and positive action taken with respect to thecurrency question He is said to benot thoroughly satisfied with the results of the deliberations of the republican house caxicus committee whichrecently formulated abiil for introduction in the house when it convenesagain Although the members of thatcommittee are unusually reticent it isunderstood that the committee has notin ell respects followed the suggestions of the president Four strongpoints were brought out by the president and the committee Jwas throughly acquainted with his position Theserecommendations wereFirst A provision that will makethe so called endless chain caused bythe redemption of greenbacks withjfold and consequent runs upon thetreasury reserve impossibleSecond That national banks be

WAS as fine a specimen of tramphumanity as ever 1 had comeacross and I almost became reconciledto the storm that had driven me intothe ramshackle wayside inn He borehis rags with inimitable grace andthere was a good temepered independent whimsical something behind hisdevil-may-care appearance that wassimply irresistible a strong dash ofpoetry and romance moreover so oftenfound in your lord of the lane and highwayHis first words disappointed me Iconfess for he spoke with the unmistakable tone and accent of a gentlemanand 1 was growing a trifle tired of people who had come down1 in lifeWhen he had finished the second pot ofale that he permitted me to pay for Ihinted somewhat rudely perhaps thatno doubt he had sect better daysSeen better days 1 should hope Ihave and worse ones too many ofthem Better days Did you evercome across a man on his beam endsthat hadnt seen better days Talkingof lies itll have struck you by thistime no doubt that man is a lying animal No Oh well thats becauseyou reonlvthinking of one kintl of liarsTheyre not all of one kind Igrant you Theres the man who deceives ethers lies a meterialist ifever there was one But then theresthe man that deceives himself andthats your idealist SeeI did see and tried to draw him outfurther but he did not really wax eloquent until he was deep in his postprandial glass of toddy and his hugeframe loomed dim from oat a smokecloud It was then I asked my man tospin me a yarnHe raised himself from his lcllinsrposture and planting both elbows onthe table looked at me with those halfquizzical half pathetic eyes of hisWhat queer fish you steady goingrespectable people are he said atlast Youre keen as ferrets on talesof wild life and low life too for thatmatter But thats neither here northere Do you believe in a regulartramp and vagabond repenting andturning round for good I meanDont you I parried laughing atthe suddenness of the question andWondering what he was driving atIve got to he answered dryly forIve seen em do it actually seen themdo it and I could no more keep themback than a baby could have doneHe stopped and sighing veiled himself in melancholy smokeHow heart breaking I murmuredsympatheticallyWhen he emerged again from thecloud the melancholy had departedNow did you ever hear of a respectable and law abiding citizen suddenlytaking a headlong plunge into trampdo m and roving on in happy lawlessness for the rest of his natural lifeI gravely shook my headHe puffed away in deep meditativeessWhy shouldnH that be possible aswell as the other he said I neverdid see why rt shouldnt and Im a bitof a mental and moral philosopher youmust know I never heard of a manworth the name who didnt pick upthat trick on the tramp and I thoughtId try and settle the question by an experiment in flesh and bloodVon actually tried to turn aA decent man into a vagabond Exactly Hark at the wind screaming upthe hillside It was just such a nightas this when T -first began But Illlet you have it in regular orderAfter I once determined on my experiment I tried to get hold of a decentsub ie t I was in London at the timetrying to ret the hang of the place andI straight folk b ing mad on wh alesI had found that out long ago and usedileiit as the thin end of the wedge withTorn Allen Id sit up in his bedroomwith him by the hour on his patentmedicine chest ranting away about theglory of a wanderers lif the excitement and the whirl and the freedomand the joy of it I bade him listen tcthe wind on a stormy night such asthisto the roar and the shout of itand the passionate snap of the branchestill the wild wind music got into hisheart and brain and he held his bwadsto his ears and bid me stopOutside the storm raged as it can rageonly on a bleak moor where the steephills rise The tramps pipe was naand the jauntiness had died out of lufavoice which cut through the scream ofthe blast low and clear exhausting almost in its intensity His eye was fullttpon me compelling me to return thegaze and I understood how this mancould hold the wills and minds ofstronger men than poor Tom Allen inthe hollow of his handI told him of a worship went on thevoiee a worship that eluded cramping church walls and lived only amontthe lonely hills where the woodlanHclasps the knees of the barren rock andin the depth of the glorious tangled torests of the joy of wandering on wi1 -outbound or goal on through titgreatwild world through town and village and hamlet on to stern and awesome regions where the gray missleeps on the moor and the blasts taup the shaggy hills with a scream thatsummons up a mans bloodSo I went on for many a long eveming how I could go on so long I dontknow for the passion of the wanderewas upon me and I was mad to go ButI went on and Tom Allen listened andhis chest would heave and his facewouM work as though he were fightingfor breath And one evening when mpatience had begun to wear thin hsuddenly jumped up and stood bolt upright with hands clinched and eyes aflashingI cant stand this any longer say Jhe and his voice sounded tremulousand determined all at once I tell youits killing me killing me this prisonlife of mine Ill throw in my lot Avithyou and well leave this place to-morrowYouve been waiting tor me 1knowI knew then that I had gained rmpurpose and 1 was sorry I wanted tbeg him to stay but I happened ttcatch his eye and saw that I might atwell try to move a rock in inidsea Weleft the place the next morning he andI The house stood at the bottom of cloug narrow road anil he was silent atdeath until we got to the tup Then hestoppeel and looked backNever no more said he in a queerharsh whisper never no moreWell I fairly dashed into the old roAing life dragging Tom Allen after meIt was summer then and old Englandwas ai its best and Tom enjoyed it juslas a hey might Only when we passedthrough villages and saw ike quietthatched homestead- and the peoplegoing to church or maybe when westopped on the road to chaff some pudding faced youngster and his motherwould cry for him from her cottage tckeep away from they lazy vaeaboneshed look at ire with a slow quiet lookand Id turn awa with something lika groan 1 can face dauger and deathwith anyone bat there was a curse inthat man eve though his heart wasgentle as a womans And as summciturned to autumn he wore that lookwell nigh every elay and somehow itseemed to drain the very life out of meHe never said a word about it and 1never said a word to him but therewere times when I wished hed strikeme dead I elid spak at last thoughIt wad a Sunday morning and wc werestanding on the top of okl Sarum hillThe bells were riiiging below with ajingle of tinks and clangs and clongsand the people were on their way tomatins I looked at Tom Allen as hstood by me silent and patient as everwith never a word of reproach on hislips only the weary slow look and Isaw death in his face that morning Hemight have been dead then he was sowhite and still Only his lips trembledand there was a tear on his cheek Ispoke thenThe storm was spent and the wndhad sobbed themselves to sleep Onlyt he i ain made music on the leavesThe vagabond remained silentWell I said at lastWell theres little more to be rdId lured him on to what was death tehim and all that remained for me to dowas to try and g et him back to lifeIsnt that so misterSomehow the quizzical note hadjrctback into his voice againSo I just began that Sunday morningto hold forth on the joys and beauty ofa quiet steady going life I wasntBuve of my powers at first but soon Isaw that the charm acted and if ever It ried to stumble at a prayer in my mindit was then for I couldnt bear to thinkof having done him to deathWell It ended as It had begun Forone day not so long after I took him bythe band as it were and led him back toLondon And he never said a word butwhen Lis old governor consented to takeI didnt know a respectable soul there him back he looked as though hed seenexcept little Tom Allen a poor cityclerk who lived in the same house as Idid And he was respectable a nervouslily livered sort of a fellow who wentto chapel regularly and had nevertasted anything stronger than waterin his life He drudged at his desk allday and came home at night to tea andPolloks Coarse of Time or some otherequally entertaining work and hedbeen living this monotonous little lifeof his for close on 25 years when I cameacross him And I fixed on him at oncefor 1 saw the untamable little tell taledevil in the corner of his meek and quieteye and I knew hed do Strangethough how a bit of the devil iurks inthe mildest of creatures and a bit ofthe brie too for that matter But letthat pSk ecept that it bring meback to what J said just now about youa vision i nat was nve years ago anaIve never troubled himsinceThe vagabond jumped up with a lurchthat sent our glasses flyingIm off now he said curtlyWhy in such a hurry I queriedHe looked at melongand earnestlyBecause I carry a resolution hesaid and resolutions are risky thingsto carry They should be marked Glasswith care and conveyed to their destination as quickly as possibleAnd what is this resolution ofyours I could not help

moreover so oftenfouud in your lord of the lane and highwayHis first words disappointed me Iconfess for he spoke with the unmistakable tone and accent of a gentlemanand 1 was growing a trifle tired of

the thin end of the wedge withTom Allen Id sit up in his bedroomwith him by the hour on his patentmedicine chest ranting away about theglory of a wanderers lif the excrement and the whirl and the freedomand the joy of it I bade him listen tcthe wind on a stormy night such asthis tc the roar and the shout of itand thepassionate snap of the branchestill the wild wind music got into hisheart A brain and he held his brradsto his ears and bid me stopOutside the storm raged as it can rageonly on a bleak moor where the steephills rise The tramps pipe was oaand the jauntiness had died out of lufavoice which eut through the scream ofthe blast low and clear exhausting almost in its intensity His eve was fullupon me compelling me to return thegaze and I understood how this mancould hold the wills and minds ofstronger men than poor Tom Allen inthe hollow of his handI told him of a worship went on thevoice a worship that eluded cramping church walls and lived only amongthe lonely hills where the woodlandclasps the knees of the barren rock andin the depth of the glorious tangled lorests of the joy of wandering on without bound or goal on through tutgreatwild world through town and village and hamlet on to stern and awesome regions where the gray missleeps on the moor and the blasts teaup the shaggy hills with a scream thatsummons up a mans bloodSo 1 went on for many a long evening how I could go on so long I donknow for the passion of the wandereiwas upon me and I was mad to go ButI went on and Tom Allen listened andhis chest would heave and his facewouM work as though he were fightingfor breath And one evening when mpat it flee had begun to wear thin lisuddenly jumped up and stood bolt upright with hands clinched and eyes aflashingI cant stand this any longer sayshe and his voice sounded tremulousand determined all at once I tell youits killing me killing me this prisonlife of mine Ill throw in ray lot withyou and well leave this place to-morrowYouve been waiting tor me IknowI knew then that I had gained mpurpose and 1 waa sorry I wanted tbeg him to stay but I happened ttcatch his eye and saw that I might aswell try to move a rock in midsea Wcleft the place the next morning he andI The house stood at the bottom of cloug narrow road and he was silent asdeath until we got to the top Then hestopped and looked backNever no more said he in a queerharsh whisper never no moreWell I fairly dashed into the old roing life dragging Tom Allen after meIt was summer then and old Englandwas at its best and Tcm enjoyed it juslas a boy might Only when we passedthrough villages and saw the quietthatched homesteads and the p oplcgoing to church or maybe When westopped on the road to chaff some pudding-facedyoungster and his motherwould cry for him from her cottage kkeep away from they lazy vagaboneshed look i me with a slow quiet lookand Id turn awaj with something liki groan 1 can face dauger and deathwith anyone but there was curse inthat mans eve though his heart wasgentle as a womans And as sunimciturned to autumn he wore that lookwell nigh every day and somehow itseemed to drain the very life out of meHe never said a word about it and Inever said a word to him but therewere times when I wished hed strikeme dead I did speak at last thoughIt wad a Sunday morning and we werestanding on the top of old Sarum hillThe bells were riiiging below with ajingle of tinks and clangs and clongsand the people were on their way tomatins I looked at Tom Allen as hstood by me silent and patient as everwith never a word of reproach on hislips only the weary slow look and Isaw death in his face that morning Hemight have been dead then he was sowhite and still Only his lips trembledand there was a tear on his cheek Ispoke thenThe storm was spent and the WiluHhad sobbed themselves to sleep Onlyt he i ain made music on the leavesThe vagabond remained silentWell I said at lastWell theres little more to be pcJdId lured him on to what was death tohim and all that remained for me to dowas to try and get him back to lifeIsnt that so misterSomehow the quizzical note had getback into his voice againSo I just began that Sunday morningto hold forth on the joys and beauty ofa quiet steady going life I wasntsave of my powers at first but soon Isaw that the charm acted and if ever Ifried to stumble at a prayer in my mindit was then for 1 couldnt bear to thinkof having done him to deathWell it ended as it had begun Forone day not so long after I took him bythe hand as it were and led him back toLondon And he never said a word buttrying to ret the hang of the place and j when his old governor consented to takeI didnt know a respectable soul there him back he looked as though he ci seenexcept little Tom Allen a poor cityclerk who lived in the same house as Idid And he was respectable a nervouiti Ja vision l nat was nve years ago anoIve never troubled himsinceThe vagabond jumped up with a lurchlilv livered sort of a fellow who went that sent our glasses flyingto chapel regularly and had nevertasted anything stranger than waterin his life He drudged at his desk allday and came home at night to tea andPolloks Coarse of Time or some otherequally entertaining work and hedbeen living this monotonous little lifeof his for close on 2T years when I cameacross him And I fixed on him at oncefor 1 saw the untamable little tell taledevil

brings meback to what J aid just now about youIm off now he said curtlyWhy in such a hurry I queriedHe looked at me long and earnestlyUecause I carry a resolution heraid and resolutions are risky thingto carry They should be marked Glasswith care and conveyed to their destination as quickly as possibleAnd what is this resolution ofyours 1 could not help askingHe bent over mewith a low laughNot
