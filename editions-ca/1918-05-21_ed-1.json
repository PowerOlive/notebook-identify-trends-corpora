KEESEE.
The funeral of Mr. Charles
Keesee, aged seventy-eight, a former
resident of this county, who died in
the Confederate Home at Pewee Val
ley, near Louisville, Saturday morn
ing, was held in the Paris Cemetery
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock,
with services at the grave conducted
by Rev. W. E. Ellis, pastor of the
Paris Christian church. The burial
took place in the Confederate lot.
The pall-bearers were Mr. Keesee's
comrades in arms in the Confederacy,
members of the local camp United
Confederate Veterans.
Mr. Keesee resided in this county
for many years and for several terms
was a member of the Bourbon Fiscal
Court. He moved to Mt. Sterling
several years ago, where he was en
gaged in the grocery business with
Mr. William Hibler, of Paris. His
health beginning to fail Mr. Keesee
went to the Confederate Home,
where he remained to the time of his
death. Attendants bailed to awake
him when the roll was called Satur
day morning, and an investigation
developed the fact that he had died
during the night, presumably from
an attack of heart trouble, to which
he was subject. Mr. Keesee left no
children, and his only survivor
is a niece, Mrs. Henry Reed, of Mt.
Sterling.

began to "pour oil upon the troubled
waters."
