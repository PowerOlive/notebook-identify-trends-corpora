She first married MiyGarrett, of Paris, and then a Mr..Anderson from somewhere East orNorth, I think. She is now a widowand we correspond occasionally. Ithink she was a relative of ColonelWilliam B. Simms, who was a member of the Confederate Congress anda man of high position in Bourboncounty, half a centry ago. By theway, I saw a few days ago in anAmerican paper that a son of Col.Simms had developed an importantracing stable in Paris. That interested me, because some of my clients here are owners of such stables. "I have a large and growing lawbusiness, of which I am the head,and to which I must give attentionfor the present. Outside of law, Iam engaged in manufacturing, inthe manufacture of automobiles, ina company of which I am president.I am also president of a textile engineering corporation of someliiiportance, a French branch of Lockwood, Greene & Co., of Boston,Mass. So, when I have a moment'sleisure, I sometimes think about rehiring, but that is as near as I everget to it."There is one other matter that Ishould like to speak of: During myfirst or second year at Center College I was a beneficiary, to the extent as 1 remember, of $200, of theGarth Fund. I should like to be putin touch with the treasurer of thatFund, because I should like to return with interest that small sum ofmoney, which at that time was tome a very laige sum of money, andhelped me to acquire what little education I now possess. Let meknow who the treasurer irf, or havehim write me, so that I may perform this little act of justice."I hope you are prospering inmind, body and estate. I can vishyoiy no better luck along those linesthan I have lutd myself. Although Iam sixty-six years old and more, 1am, aside from playing a little atbeing sick now and again, in almost perfect health. I have got asmuch money as I need to be an independent human being, I don't1 ave to woik too hard, and I am ofpucli a happy disposition that life tome in Paris (Franco) seems an idealthing. I should be veiy glad tohear that you are coming to Parirthis summer for your vacation. Ifyou should ever do so it would bepleasant to me to do what I can tcmake your visit interesting."Some years befoie the war HalBrent and his wife made me a visit,and during the war one of KellyBrent's sons came in to see me inhis soldier uniform. I met Halagain a year or two ago in Washington, and we talked a little aboutold times, but I should like to get intouch again more directly from thegreater Paris with the littler Parisacross the ocean."Please remember me to anyonein Bourbon county who remembeisme. Tell them that I am verymuch alive, and have set out to bohundred years old, being in fact,two-thirds of the way there now. Ihave lived in France for twentyfive years, and I am so far Gallicized that I shall never be content tolive anywhere else."Here is my list of the pupils inProf. Yerkes' school in 1871-1872:James Mclntyre, Wm.
