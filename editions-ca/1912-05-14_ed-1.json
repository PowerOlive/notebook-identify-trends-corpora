Miss Jennie Maurie Pepper, one of
the seniors in expression, gave a re
cital at the M. F. C. auditorium, Fri
day evening. She was greeted by a
large audience. Miss Pepper is not
only one of our most popular young
ladips, but she is also a hard student
at the M. F. C. and is a graduate this
year in both expression and in liter
ary department. As a reader, the
people were largely familiar with her
worK and knew that they had every
reason to expect much and were not
disappointed. Paits of her program
were very heavy and she managed
her work with the care of a skilled
artist. She is one of our most ambiti
ous young ladies and does not mean
to stop with this. She will probably
attend the school of dramatic art at
Cincinnati next season. She was
supported by Misses Blackmon and
Hurst as pianoists, Misses Nell and
Hurst violinists and Mrs. Deering as
vocalist.

Unabfe to Count Beyond Four.
A close observer has definitely es
tablished the fact that magpies and
rooks cannot count further than four.
rook never returns to its nest until
it is quite satisfied that there is no
danger near. Yhen four hunters or
less departed in succession from a
near-by log cabin, the rook would re
turn to its nest after the last had
?one out of sight. But whenever there
:vere more the bird lost count and re
turned to its nest even while some
rver9 still in the hut.
H Wamt an Ang.
During one of the earlier discussions
of the United State tariff in the
Canadian parliament, an opposition
member characterized the attitude of
the govemnjent on the question as "a
3ight that would make angels weep
and jackasses laugh." The Hon. Frank
Oliver, who was then minister of the
interior, replied, with his usual delib
erate calmness: "I have observed
that the honorable gentleman, has
been one of those who laughed."

Selz Tine Shoes Tor Wen.
You hear a good deal now-a-days about "guaranteed' mer
chandise, especially Shoes.
Sometimes it's a guarantee that the shoes are made of good
leather, with a lot of detail about the way they're made. Selz
shoes are guaranteed to be satisfactory to yon. What do you care
what the shoe's are made of if they're not satisfactory to yon.
"Sometimes it's a guarantee that the shoes shall wear a certain
length of time , Selz shoes are guaranteed to be satisfactory to
you. What difference does it make how long they last, if they're
not satisfactory? The longer dissatisfaction lasts the worse off
you are.
Selz shoes are guarantee to be satisfactory ; and that means
YOUR satisfaction, not our3 or Selz. It means good . leather, of
course; poor leather wouldn't be satisfactory. It means long ser
vice, of course; a shoe that wears out too soon isn't satisfactory.
It means correct style and good fit; you wouldn't be satisfied with
anything less.
The Selz Guarantee
The name SELZ stamped on the sole of a
shoe is a gurrantee of absolute satisfaction. Re
member, your dealer is authorized to see that you
get absolute satisfaction from every pair of
shoes bearing the mark

Every gallon pays a big dividend
There's as much difference between sprayed and un
sprayed vegetables as there is between those grown on good
and poor soil. A gallon of spray material costs only a few
cents, but the increase in the value of. vegetables sprayed with
it amounts to dollars. Try spraying as an investment.
S-W LIME-SULFUR SOLUTION gives very satisfactory results as an
insecticide and fungicide. It is effective against all sucking insects
and when used at a weak dilution it will effectually control fungus
diseases. This preparation contains practically no sediment, is uni
form and very strong. It will not crystallize or clog the sprayer.
