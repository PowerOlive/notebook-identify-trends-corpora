SNAPP SCOTT.
Miss Olive R. Snapp, daughter of
Mr. Carl Snapp, and Mr.
Will Scott, both of this city, were
married in Lexington, Wednesday af
ternoon at four o'clock at the home
of the officiating minister, Rev. I. J.
Spencer. The attendants -were Miss
Hattie Neal, of Paris, and Miss Emma
Arkle, of Lexington.
Mr. and Mrs. Scott returned to
Paris on the 8:15 interurban car,
and were received at Eighth street
by a merry party of friends, who pro
ceeded to give them an old-fashioned
welcome. In sopne respects it resem-N
bled a Hallowe en celebration, as the
merrymakers with tin horns, rattles,
tin pans and other noise-making de
vices, greeted the newly-weds. The
usual rice-throwing and shying of old
shoes mingled with noisy congratula
tions, all well-meant.
The bride is a very handsome and
attractive young woman, who for
some time was an attache of the
Simon department store. The groom
is an ejmploye of the Louisville &
Nashville railroad at this point, and
an industrious young gentleman.
