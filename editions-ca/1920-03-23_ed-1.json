Mary Pickford's greatest play,
"Polyyanna," is to be shown at the
Alamo and Grand Theatre, to-morrow
and Thursday. Critics every
where assert that "Pollyanna" is
cne of the greatest picture-plays ever
filmed. The reason for this is that
the philosophy upon which, the story
is based constituted a theme which
at. the present time has an unusually
wide appeal.
Undoubtedly Mary Pickford, with
characteristic far-sightedness, had
this in mind when she chose this
wherever possible, which will act as
a propaganda of good." It is their
ambition to have each screen me
dium serve a definite purpose, and
withthis in mind Mary Pickford
decided to picturize Eleanor H. Por
ter's famous book. So "Pollyanna"
is a picture with a mission.
