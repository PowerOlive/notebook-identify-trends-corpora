Paris Defeats Cynthiana;
The Cynthiam Club with Linville
aud Maffitt, two former Blue Grasi
leaguers, as tbe battery, werp taken
into camp Sunday afternoon by the
league champions in a slow, uninter
esting contest, after the first three
sessions, by a score of 14 to 0.
The Paris men hammered Linville all
over the lot and a total of fifteen hits
rwere made off of his delivery, which.
coupled with errors at critical times,
netted fourteen tallies.
The boys from the Maiden City were
in no way equal to the deceptive bend
ers of Wood and Schrauder and during
the nine sessions could do no better
than secure two safe drives, one of
which was on the fluky order.
In the eight inning binville, for the
visitors, tired badly and in order to
complete the contpst Shears was hand
ed over to the Cynthiana crowd and
pitched the final inning.
, Baroett starred with the &tick in this
performance and out of five times up
hit safely four times. In the sixth
inning he pounded the horse hide for a
homer, the ball hitting at the foot of
thfc left field fence and bounding over.
Ihe raris team played a perfect
game until the ninth inning when after
Jouett had gone out on an easy bound
er to McKernan, Barnett fumbled
Maffett's grounder and Harrell let
Richer's bounder get away, both iui
ncrs being safe. The side was retired
when Gates hit a long one to Goodman
who doubled Maffett at second. Tnt
score:
