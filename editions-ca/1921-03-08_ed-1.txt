MARCHPARIS POSTOFFICE lootFOUND IN LOUISVIELEKndinsr of Mail Sack Gives NewTwist To Paris PostofficeRobbery.The discovery in Louisville, Saturday night, of a mail sack containing various articles Rnion vParis postoffice Thursday morning byyeggmen who blew the safe with dynamite and escaped with a. largeamount of valuable booty gave a newtwist to the affair. The LouisvilleHerald Sunday carries the followingstory: t"That yeggmen who blew open thevaults of the Paris postoffice lastThursday came to Louisville withthi-ir loot, estimated at - between?9,000 and $25,000 and divided' iihere jvas indicated by a discardedmail sack and contents found Fridaynight in a vacant lot behind someash barrels adjoining the negro Calvary Baptist Church, on Fifth street,near York."Two-cent J'postage-due" stampsand a- bundle of private papers belonging to Wm. Cooper, assistantpostmaster of Paris, were among thepapers recovered. The exact valueis not yet known."The sack was found by WilliamPrather, janitor of the church, whenhe came to prepare the building forthe morning's services. He at oncenotified the police. Patrolman EllisH. Thornsberry and Louis Dierkin,of the Sixth District, brought thesack in and turned it over to the postal authorities. Chas. S. Raidy, superintendent of jmails, and W. B.Gieenaway, postoffice inspector, atonce checked over the contents."In addition to the postage duestamps which were useless to therobbers, the sack was stuffed withthe torn off margins of thousands ofdollars worth of postage stamps, indicating that the robbers were professionals and probably specialists atrobbing postoffices, according to Mr.Greenaway. The margins of allstamps are numbered and if accidentally left on when stamping letters, might enable inspectors to tracethe movements of the robbers, hesaid. The only valuable papersfound were those J belonging to Mr.Cooper, consisting of certificates foroil and various other stocks.'A number of torn and empty envelopes, sqme registered, were &in the sack or dropped near the placeit was found. Some of them were addressed to financial institutions."One of the envelopes - was registered letter No. 1737, which hadbeen opened and left on the groundby the robbers. It was addressed toS. E. Bedford, president of the Peopies-Deposit Bank at Paris, Ky. Theenvelope had contained a check for$6,000 sent the bank by Ira D.Thompson, president of the Thompson-HumbleLumber Co., of Somerset,Ky.. Mr. Bedford said. As soon asthe news of the postoffice robberyreached Somerset, he said, Mr.Tbompson stopped payment on thecheck, and, of course, suffered noloss."While Louisville detectives andfederal authorities took up a searchhere for the bandits, it was believedthat they had long since left thecity, probably for some Northerncity. No other pouch from the Parisoffice has been found at any point.Hope was held that the private papers found (might prove of considerable value, thus returning a part ofIhe loss" to the losers,"Much of the property taken, it isunderstood, belonged to WalterPayne, postmaster; Assistant Cooperand William Clark, clerk."An inspector working out of theCincinnati, office under whic allKentucky postoffice inspectors are assigned is in charge of the case, Mr,Greenaway said, his own connectionwith it being merely the local" endwhich developed last night."Before the sack was found Mr.Greenaway was notified from Lexington that the robbers might beheaded toward Louisville, as anabandoned automobile found in theBluegrass city$ contained evidencethat it had been used by at least twomen involved in the robbery. ""Various theories were advancedas to the manner in which the postoffice bandits made their getawayfrom Louisville after dividing thespoils. .The sack containing theirloot, now in possession of the postoffice' inspector here, was an -ordinarycanvas sack, evidently snatched up at random, into which themen stuffed war savings stajmps,packages of registered mail, money,stamps and other valuables, afterthey dynamited two large safes andtwo small ones in the Paris office,Mr. Greenaway said."Inspector Beck, 6f Lexington, whoha? had charge of the mvestfgatioiiof the theft, has completed his work.Mr Beck states that the actual los-has been tabulated and ismuch loer than as fiist reported "The yeggmen," he stated, ''obtained about$100 in money and less than $10,000 in stamps. The funds of theParis postoffice are deposited eachday in a local bank.

Clark waseducated in the public schools of histown and later attended State College at Lexington.

He then decidedto study law.Clark went to Cincinnati to arrange for entrance as a student inthe Cincinnati Law School. On hisway home he became acquaintedwith a Paris man, who suggestedthat he stop in Paris and apply forthe position of superintendent of theParis schools. This he did, and following his application was elected tothat position. Upon returning to hijhcjme in Lawrenceburg he foundawaiting him a letter tendering theappointment as president of MarshallCollege, in Marshall, Mo., which heaccepted. Thus Paris lost as a resident a man who afterward becameone of the Nation's foremost statesmen. A TRIBUTEFather W. J. O'Hara, who comesfrom Nicholasville to Paris to succeedRev.

The Bourbon CountyWarehouse Company completed theblock sale of the day previous selling on their floors a total of 88,025pounds for $14,124.34, an"average of$16.04.Receipts during the past weekhave not been to large as in previous weeks, and many growers predict the market will not last manyweeks longer. Most of the tobacconow being brought in is of an inferior quality. Warehouse men expressed the opinion last week thatthe low grade stuff was bringingfairly good prices, saying that it wasbringing every cent it was worth.Most of those familiar with marketconditions predict that the priceswould remain fairly steady from nowuntil the market closes.Through all the week the tobaccobrought in has been of more andmore of low quality, until now practically all of the best weed has beensold. The warehousemen considerthat the decrease in the average hasbeen more than offset by the decrease in the quality of the offerings,and that the market last week wasas strong as the circumstances wouldwarrant.Y.

Leaving thehotel, the Presidential party proceeded to the White House, where President Wilson entered the automobileoccupied by the President-elect. Mrs.Wilson joined Mrs. Harding in another automobile and the trip to theCapitol then was started. VicePresident Marshall and4 Vice-President-electCoolidge occupied the thirdautomobile in the" procession, whileMrs. Marshall and Mrs. Coolidge rodein another car with some members ofthe Congressional committee. Othermembers of the committee rode withPresident and President-elect andwith Mr. Marshall and Mr. Coolidge.Pennsylvania avenue from theWhite House to the Capitol, wascrowded with home folks and visitorsanxious tfor a glimpse of the new andretiring Presidents. There were noreviewing stands and most of thespectators were forced to stand alongthe sidewalks. The more fortunatehad seats in windows facing the avenues. At the Capitol the east plaza,with its standing room for thousands,was packed, and the crowd overflowed out over the park spaces and avenues which converge there. Most ofthese thousands were able to hearthe inaugural address as Mr. Harding's voice was carried far out bymeans of a sound amplifying deviceinstalled over the platform.oEX-SERVICE MEN AND FEDERALBOARD COOPERATING TOLIBERALIZE VOCATIONAL ACT.A bill. has been pVoposed by theFederal Board for Vocational Education for the purpose of liberalizingthe present .Act and extending" itsbenefits.

WhenRepresentative Rucker of the Missouri delegation arose to announce it.his voice choked with emotion. Itwas a halting, brief eulogy he pronounced, but it drew from memberssigns of sorrow more elnmient thanwords to tell of the place the deadleader held jn their affection andrespect. The formal motion for ahalf-hour adiournment was made hvRepresentative Mondell, Republicanleader.Mr. Clark would have been 71years old had he lived until nextMonday, but his twenty-six years ofservice in the House would have ended on Friday, for he was defeatedfor re-election.In thev subdued talk on floor or incloakrooms, while theHouse paused inhonor of his memory, friends ofyears' standing scorned the sugges-.: 4.1. I. Xl- 4 i. 1 L 4 Jt-Liu ii Liiab tne siuul neart ox tne mis-sourian had been shaken by politicaldefeat. That he had forseen longin advance, they said. The death ayear ago of his idolized three-year-oldgrandson and namesake, ChampClark Thompson.Since that blow it was said Mr.Clark's colleagues had noted a waning of his keen interest in public affairs and a little droop to the massiveshoulders so familiar through -theyears in the corridors of the Capitol.There was one thing upon which allwere agreed that Mr. Clark had diedas he wished to die, in the harness of.his life work.He had planned retirement to hishome in Bowling Green, Mb., afterMarch 4, but the end found him stillserving his country and his State inthe House. That made it possible forthe House to vote his widow a yearof her husband's salary as its firstbusiness when the memorial adjournment was over.Dr. Jesse Shoup, Mr. Clark's physician had little hope from the day hispatient was taken down with a cold.Pleurisy developed quickly, but behind that there was an accumulationof ailments, due largely to advancedage and the reckless energy Mr.Clark had thrown into his work. Todevelopment of these the cold openedan easy door. It was only a question of a little time, Dr. Shoup knew,despite the- courageous fight his patient was making, and besides Mrs.Clark, the former Speaker's son, Bennett, and his daughter and her husband, Mr. and Mrs. James M. Thomson, of New Orleans, were at his bedside through all his last hours.In the Senate .word of Mr. Clark'sdeath was given by Senator Harrisonof Mississippi. He spoke feelinglyof the service the veteran Democratfcleader had rendered his party and thenation, but Mr. Clark's wishes thatno halt in the business of Congressshould be made in his honor prevailed, and the Senate kept on at itswork.In the Democratic National Convention at Baltimore in 1912, ChampClark led on twen,ty-seven ballots forthe nomination as candidate forPresident, and had a clear majorityon nine ballots prior to the final naming of Woodrow Wilson. The, twothirds rule of the convention aloneprevented Mr. Clark's nomination.The honor which his party thus paidhim was the most notable of his public life. In" American political historyMartin Van Buren was the onlyother man who failed of the Democratic nomination for the Presidencyafter having received a majority ofthe 'votes in the national convention,but he enjoyed the unique distinctionof being elected subsequently.William J. Bryan's sensational attack on Mr. Clark at Baltimore,charging him with, being affiliatedwith leaders representing "the interests," held the convention in,deadlockfor more than a week, wheif it endedin the nomination of Wilson. Bryan'sspeech, declaring that Thomas F.Ryan, August Belmont and CharlesF. Murphy were supporting Clark,was a bolt from the blue which madethe Clark ranks waver. Clark supporters declared afterward that noneof the three leaders mentioned wasfor Clark as first choice, but that theunit rule carried the New York delegation to the Clark fbrces.The breach between Bryan andClark never healed, although theymet at a luncheon arranged by mutualfriends a few months later andexchanged perfunctory speeches.Coolness between Clark and Wilsoncounty. His next step was into theivxiH&ouri legislature, where he framed the Missouri nrimarv law. an aT.fitrust statute and an Australian ballotlaw. He Was Permanpn-f-.

He welded the minority into avirtual Democratic unit when he wasminority leader, and after the oustingof Cannon, which robbed the Speakership of many of its powers, he divided with Majority Leader Underwood the control of the Democrats inthe House and thev formed a nreatworking team.fhymcially he was a giant of a man,standing over six feet two inches inheight and weighing a trifle morethan 200 pounds.speaker Clark and Mrs. ChampClark, a familiar figure in theSpeaker's bench in the crallerv. entertained not only at an annual Newi ear s house and at other functions,but gave informal weekly luncheonsat the capitol to which members andthe capitol to which members andothers were invited.
