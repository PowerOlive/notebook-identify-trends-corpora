the Crimea during the winter GenCanrobert was in the habit of going outamong the men of his command incognito to see what they were about andto learn their wants and encourage thesoldiers if they

bred By experimenting on these lines it has beendiscovered that such standards are themost desirable for steeplechasingandthe hunting fieldIt is imperative that good boneshall figure in the anatomy of crosscountry stock and for this reason it isbelieved to be a mistake to cultivateits lineage up to that of the thoroughbred The Virginians are not onlypainstaking and intelligent breedersbut they have studied the art of train-ng or schooling as it is termed inhunting circles and added to this is aremarkable knack for riding which iscommon among them The consequence is they have established a profitable industry and find ready marketsnot only in Washington and Baltimorebut in- Philadelphia New York andBoston and have even supplied horsesto the officers of the English garrisonstationed at

monsterrattlesnake one day recently and it wasonly his coolness and presence of mindxthat saved him irom death Prof Riceand Dr Tynan the bugologist were upin the higher altitudes of the Sierrain search of specimens and werecamped at a place called Moore CreekThey had a small tent with them whichthey had pitched near a stream of watertthat was fed by a spring higher up onthe side of the mountainFriday evening of last week theprofessor and his companion who werelcompletely worn out with their daystramp in search of rare flowers andtbugs retired to their tent rolled them-selves up in their blankets and weresoon in dreamland Just as daylightwas breaking the professor wasawakened from his slumbers by feeling a soft and clammy substance crawling over his face and down on to hichest and on raising his head a littleto his horror he discovered it was a monster rattlesnake The reptile had coileditself with its head raised about a footand ready at the least movement madeto strikeCold drops of perspiration oozed fromevery pore of the professors bodywhile his muscles became as rigid asbars of iron and his eyes became fixedwith a stony glare as he gazed at thehead of the monster which was aboutsix or seven inches from his face andswinging from one side to the otherwith the regularity of a clock pendulum The suspense was becoming unbearable but still he knew that the leastmove that he made meant death in themost horrible form How long he remained in this terrible position he doesnot know but it seemed ages when suddenly he felt his muscles relax hievision grew dim everything aroundhim became dark and in a few secondshe was oblivious to everything aroundhim The doctor was quietly sleepinga few feet away unconscious of the terrible danger of his companion Whenhe awoke the sun was brightly stream-ing into the tent and as he rolled overin his blankets toward his companionhis blood seemed to chill in his veins atthe sight presented to his view Hiscompanion was stretched at full lengthupon the ground with his eyes closedand his face as white as a piece of marble while coiled upon his breast was ahuge rattlesnake apparently asleepHe quietly seized a shotgun that wasstanding near by and cocking bothbarrels raised it to his shoulder andwas about to fire when he realized thatif he did he would probabty injure hiscompanion Just at this moment hiscompanion moved a little when thesnake gave a rattle and again raised hishead The doctor seeing his chancefired and at the report of the gun hiscompanion gave a yell and pumped tohis feet throwing the reptile three orfour feet awav from him in its dnthstruggle The doctors aim was truelfor the reptiles head was blown completely offOn being measured it was found to be4 feet 9 inches in length and had 17rattles and a button The professorsnerves were so shattered by his terrible experience that he was hardly ableto walk and the following day in company with his companion he returnedto this place

earthquakes in the degree of apprehensionand terror which they create duringj their actual happeningFortunately in most parts of theworld they occur only at long intervalsand probably only a very

latter being of considerable extent the discharge will oftennot follow these branches but willjump across the opening of the V thuscutting the loop out of its path It canoscillate quicker over the air

careful account of the cost ofkeeping1 each cow of the herd with aview of determining the cost of apound of butter made from the milk ofeach cow The cost varied from eightto twelve cents a pound some animalscosting 50per cent more than others inproducing a pound of butter TVe divided the herd into two classes andfound that the division that cost themost to produce butter had a tendencyto put on flesh more than the othersIn order to be doubly sure that ouronclusions were correct we made asecond test with the same result Nowwhy was this I examined the twoclasses individually and found thatthe spare built cow with a deep bodywas the best dairy cow In both divisions all breeds of cows were represented What we wanted to find outif possible was how to be able to tellwithout making a mistake the animalthat would make butter the cheapestCareful investigation -developed thefact that it took one pound of food tomaintain 100 pounds of animal weightbo that an animal that weighed 900pounds would digest TS pounds of feedrequired nine poundsto support herselfand should return the remaining ninepounds to her ownerWe must feed the -cow just what sheneeds to maintain and produce thegreatest

statedand re stated almost times withoutnumber Its importance is sufficient tojustify all the attention which it has received Xot only this but the generaltruth which such a statement containshas a far wider application All domestic animals should receive kindtreatment and should be kept as comfortable as possible Whether the animal is kept for work for breeding purposes for fattening or for producingin any other direction it is certain thatthe best results can only be obtainedby treating it kindty Fer physicalinjury or nervous irritation will certainly make the animal less profitable

not developat all in one generation but breaks outin a serious disease laterCancer the most dreadful of all diseases is often the result of some bloodtaint inherited from generations backIt often appears as a mere mole or insignificant pimple which later developsinto an alarming condition No oneknows but that he may be subject to aninherited impurity in the blood nor canhe tell whether or not this may someday crop out in the form of destructivecancer It is therefore important thatany little sore or scratch which doesnot readily heal be given prompt attestion or a serious condition may resultMr Robert Smedley of Ocala Flawas the victim of a malignant cancerwhich first appeared in the manaeraboM described He writesM first I paid no attention to thelittle blotches on my face thinking theywould soon pass away Before longhowever they became sore and soonbegan to enlarge I applied ordinarylocal remedies but they had no effectadd I then consulted a physician Whenffenz LyiltraiP Hhe told me I had cancer I becamealarmed and hastened to obtain treatment for I knew how dangerous cancerwasI received the best medical attention but the cancer continued togrow worse until the physiciansfinally said that I would have tohave an operation performed as thatwas the only hope for me This I refused to submit to as I knew cancer wasa blood disease and my common sensetold me that it was folly to expect anv operation to cure a blood diseaseKnowing S S S to be a good bloodremedy I decided to try it and the firstbottle produced an improvement Icontinued the medicine and in fourmonths the last scab dropped off Tenyears have elapsed and not a sign oithe disease has returnedThe alarming increase in the numberof deaths which occur as the result of asurgical operation is attracting generalattention and a strong sentiment againstsuch methods of treatment is fast developing among the most intelligentclasses It seems that in almost everycase wkere the doctors treatment isunsuccessful the learned physicians decide at once that an operation must beperformed and the keen blade of thesurgeon is recklessly resorted toThe many caustic plasters which areapplied to remove cancers are more painful than death and the danger of agical operation is as great as the diseaseitself No plaster or surgical operation can cure cancer because it isa blood disease the destructive
