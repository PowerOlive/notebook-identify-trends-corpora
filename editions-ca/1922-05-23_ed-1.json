LODGE NOTES
The Grand Commandery, at its
-annual conclave in Maysville last
r week, adopted a resolution providing
rthat no candidate should hereafter
be knighted until after he had se
cured his uniform. It will not be
necessary to say that this is a -very
important matter with Knight Tem
Trtars. It was decided at the Grand En
campment meeting in Lexington last
week to change the date of meeting
from the third Wednesday in May
"to the second Wednesday in May
each year. The change was made
because of confliction with the
.Knight Templar meeting which is
held during the third week of May.
The boys' band of the Odd Fellows
Home which attended the Knfght
"Templar conclave at Maysville last
week and played for the Paris com
mandery received great applause in
the parade.
Quinby Lodge, Knights of Py'li
ias, of Cynthiana, will hold- their
annual memorial service in honor of
deceased brothers, on Sunday, May
2S. As usual, they will be assisted
in the exercises by a largedelega
tion from Rathbone Lodge, No. 12,
and the A. J. Lovely Company, No.
34, Uniform Rank, K. of P., of Paris.
