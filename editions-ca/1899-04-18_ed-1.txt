iiglu crew but still more Lhan two to theironeCHAPTER VI ominikdBy these arguments Mr Tymi finallyprevailed and the idea of an assaultwas abandoned We then fell to talking and Capt Seliinger remarked thatat least we were in command of nearlynil the powder in the ship the magazine lying beneath in the hold and thedouble doors betwixt that and the general storage securely locked it wouldrequire the use of a ram and violencebr considerable work of carpentry tobreak throughYet I conceive they inig lit employone or the other said Mr Tym andsince we have the floor of the storageroom between us and the magazinethe sound might be cut off T think wehad best raise von trap to be prudentSay vim do it Mast tr ArdickI disturbed the scuttle accordinglyand we moved that May that we mightcatch even a small sound of operationAt least if it comes to the worstavc can blow up the ship said the captain with a setting together of thelips yet not quite so desperate as hisair was I thoughtI pray you let us think of less desperate measures1 1 said quite disturbed Surely we should take muchencouragement from what we havedone and trust to the like fortune inthe future They are but eight asyou say and for the nicsl part of smallskill with arms We are only threebut all have a good knowledge ofweapons for I would have you to knowthat 1 am no novice with either broadsword or backsword having had instruction from an approved maitredarmes -so the real odds are by nomoans what they seemThis is all good said Mr Tymwith a tranquil air and 1 doubt notthat wo could hold them a stiff boutso we could have thorn all in front andno use of firearms Yet let us remainas wo are for awhile and see whethera still better way will not openF ith said the captain quicklyit may be opening now I see somesort of glimmer or spark through thechinks in yon doorThe spark flickered before the cracksin the door and I was just thinkingthat it might be the match of an oldfashioned uti and had opened mymouth to titter a warning when theglimmer increased to a clear littleflame and as it did so some one knockedon the doorWho is there called out CaptSeliingerIts us sir Toby Hedge and TomFlyngWhat do you want Hedge

Masterrradey offer spoke up Mr Tymsomewhat to my surpriseHe will spare your lives and giveyou good treatment answered thesailor It seemed to me that he spokesomething eagerlyOf what sort are the mates plansThe man hung a little in the windThere you have me out of soundings sir he said at last You willneed to ask Master PradeyI have done with him said the supercargo turning with an indifferentair to the captain I did but tryhimAnd I wish not even to go to thatlimit said IHarkee fellows cried Capt Selljnger sternly Begone and tell thatlobseouring villain to do as he listsWe will neither trust him nor holdfurther parley with himThe men received the message in silence and presently we hoard them retire and the glimmer of their lanthorndied otit1 think they will now leave us inpeace for a little -aid Mr Tym withthe remark sheathing his sword Theyhave found they can neither overbearus and till thev think of somethingnew will of necessity do nothingI hold the same said the captainand my council is that we take advantage of the lull and catch a littlerestWith all my heart said the super-cargo Let us be about it Ibyawned prodigiously but added laughing I am not so worn out as 1 seemTwas but a lazy trick of youthI felt much encouragement and ina sort relief at his manner The st raintill now had boon great and my coinage in some wise had begun to flagIn truth 1 was now at such businessand had not learned that steadfastness and command over my nerves thatwore to come with future experienceWe were now ready to arrange ourwatches and it only remained to decide who should tirst stand and whoturn in We settled this after a littleargument by my being chosen for thewatch below using the nauticalphrase though in strictness it scarcely applied and 1 accordingly selectedthe mates cabin and stretched myselfin the bunkI cannot say how long 1 slept but Iknow I was awakened at last by asound of crashing wood and on starting up J found the ship almost withoutmotion and a few faint day streakscoming in at the w indow I was on myfeet straightway and caught up myhanger and pistol What had happened I could not conjecture but itmust be something of import I hearkened for an instant but there was norepetition of the sound and withouttarrying longer I flung open the doorand rushed out My friends were ontheir feet sword in hand and by thecocking of their heads were in the actof listeningWhat is it I cried What is doingNay we know not for a certaintyreplied Mr Tym coolly but by thenoise it is the splintering of boatsIs it not light enough to scan thedeck I asked I think there becracks in the door sufficient to seethroughWe tried but now and could discover nothing answered the supercargo Yet no harm to make a freshattemptWith this I stopped to the door andapplied my eye to the chiefest crackI thought I caught a glimpse of sonicshadowy figures Stimulated by thediscovery I boldly drew away the fastoning and peered out 1 inst antly discovered two or throe forms flittingabout the bows and as I looked sawone mount the bulwark and drop overIn a moment it came to me what wasdoing The mutineers were desertingthe ship I flung the door wide andmath a significant gesture to my companions They were beside me in atwinkling and on beholding the deserted dee tumbled unhesitatinglyout I was at their heels and we continued to the confines of the quarterdeck whore we fetched up and lookedaround All was indeed clear Poopafterdeck midships and foredecknot a soul to be seenMy companions had mounted thebulwark and were bending over anIthe captain was wagging his head andpointing at something over the quarter I w s at no loss to guess what itwas and upon running a bit one sideand looking past the poop I made certain It was in fact the escapingmutineersThey were all in one boat the -hipslong boat - and by the aid of severaloars were drawing pretty fast to windward I could not stop to make moreof them than this for the shin was nowall ways in the wind and 1 hastened tofetch her upon her course The breezewas light and no harm done and I presently had her about her business andall drawing as it should By this timethe boat was again tinder my observation for she was now upon the weatherbow instead of the weather quarterand I had opportunity to scan Iter withmore exactness She held all the tenmen that is the mate old Lewsonthe disabled ailor the cook the cabinboy and the five other seamen Ishould say here that the cabin boywas scarce of reality a boy since hewas 17 and as big as some of the menThe boat was fitted with a sail whichtwo fellows forward were even nowsetting and by the pile of boxes andcasks amidships was well supplied withall manner of stores1 stood on tiptoes and peered withimpatience over the poop hoping tocome by a glimpse of my companionsand resolve what they were doing butjust at the moment I heard Mr Tymhe made answer For myself say something and following theIwords his head rose above the poopladderAt the helm he called out composedlyAye aye I answered almost atremble with anxiety How faresitNot over well he returned withthe same coolness Tradey has stovethe boats and spiked at least a part ofthe guns But the captain would haveyou belowYet a word I said as I gave up thetiller Is the ship scuttledSo the captain conceives Hewhipped into the cabin to note fromthe window whether the gig was stoveor no and as he was returning descended for a bit to the storeroom Hereported the hold all a washThen we are indeed in the plight ofyour inconvenient kittens I criedflinging myself with all speed towardthe poop ladderThe captain coneeivedit wise to paya visit to the hold for although he hadmade sure that there was a great andunusual body of water there he hadnot determined the rate at which itwas gaining nor beyond questionthat it had made to a point whorethere was no hope in striving with itWe advanced into the t ween docksaccordingly and from thence descended to the hold where we immediatelyperceived that the worst of our forebodings wore justified In sooth itwas a sure turn of work enough forthe bottom had been clean piercedWith our little force towork the pumpswe could no more than partially relievo the ship and could elTect nothing in curing the trouble which wasin a word past our mending Wereturned at once to Mr Tym and thecaptain bravely and coolly as itseemed to mo reported the thing as itstood The supercargo looked gravebut not dismayed and said that sincesuch was the sit uat ion lie presumed wemust forthwith sot about constructinga raftAve iiiisw ered the captain brieflyFollow me and we will at itWo did not stop to try the well knowing nearly enough what it would showbut proceeded with all haste to prepare our material and put it togetherbeing assured that we had no time tolose Some spa1 e spars were first laiddown as a frame for the structureother and lighter spars were plaeodacross and firmly lashed and thespaces between were filled in withsuch material small planks and thelike as were readv to be come atLet us see whai this craft will do under clotheOver ail we placed the two cabin doorsand the main part of the boards thathad formed the bulkhead forward ofthe twe n decks Empty breakers orwater casks were then lashed alongall sides to act as bulwarks and thestructure was finished We launchedher without much trouble the sea running light and there being only a smallwind and when she was clear of thetackle we brought her under the quarter and with great haste for now theship went heavily and showed hownearly lie was waterlogged we fittedher outShe is beginning to settle said ijust as we got the last things put everYes answered Capt Seliingerbut she may not go down for a littletime for all thatlb seemed loath to quit his goodship and 1 could not wonder but yetthere was little room in the businessfor sentiment We finally east off andI put over our oar and sculled off amatter of 1U0 yards or so where wehung for a little space at the cuptains desire to watch the end of thepoor craft We had hardly any time toait Of a sudden she seemed to give agreat jar steadied and almost stoodstill and then with a fling upward ofher stern plunged down and in almostan instant wallowed fro in sight Thebroken waves swung in riding in ringsabove her vanished masts and thespace she had occupied was open sealike the restTill the Industry had thus come toher end we could not fetch our mindsto other concerns but now the captain gave a sigh which seemed tobreak the spell and we stirred in ourplaces and presently fell to talkingThe longboat was still lifting and falling on the swells to the south of usher sail not very well tilled on accountof the light breeze but yet already aconsiderable distance off and slowlygaining For ourselves we had hoisted no canvas and were making no effort to come upon any course andwere therefore merely slipping gentlyto leewardPray where do you prick us downon the chart inquired Mr Tym oTthe captain after we had speculated alittle upon the weather and the present mild windComing at it as near as may beanswered Capt Seliinger we shouldbe in T52 of north latitude and in longitude may be GO That would fetch ussomewhat above 100 miles east of theBermudas and near to 800 miles fromour pdrtI had thought a bit farther northand east returned the supercargoI l wi but doubtless I am astrav as to yourBmjlast observation Then such tinT Iwuies wnax say you we should deduce from them in other words howshall we lay our courseWell he said with a bitter lookinto the south had we yonder boat Icould fetch you a straight answer butwhat navigator shall lay you cnecourse of a raft It will be as thewind says As it holds now we mightstrive to make the Bermudas but bythe looks of the sky and the smell cvthe air there should presently be achange and it is odds that it fetcLtesthen from the northBy which it seems said the supercargo rather gravely that we are ina worse case than I had conceived andcan do little save wait and trust inGod I had thought he added more inhis usual manner that this was thetrade wind which we count to be in amanner steadfastAye ind so it is answered thecaptain only not at present confirmed and with a staying weight in itBut since it is better to do somethingthan nothing and no harm can comeby it we will set the sail Master Ardick pluck the mast from among theraffle yonder fetch that large piece ofcanvas and let us see what this craftwill do tinder clothsIt came like a lyt of cheer to havethis rational thing to do after such asolemn go round and I made haste tooverhaul the spar and canvas and fetchthem aft Here was the clearest spaceand I spread the art ieles out and thecaptain and T fell to work In a verylittle time we had the affair ready andI carried
