HENRY CLAY CAMPAIGN BAN
NEE OF 1844
A Henry Clay campaign banner,
dating back to 1844, with a picture
of the great statesman in the cen
ter and fringed with heavy gold
bands, has been presented to the
Kentucky Historical Society1 at
Frankfort by Mrs. Charles Thomas
Varnon, of Walton, Ky.
The color of the banner is "ashes
of roses," a mixture of lavender and
red, a combination seldom seen to
day. Four penants are painted on
the top of the portrait and contain
the following words: "The Victory
is Won With Law, Order, Liberty
and Union," and "Presented by the
Whig Ladies, Sisters' Smiles Will
Greet You." Mrs. Lafferty stated
that the banner was made when
Clay was at the height of his power
and popularity. The banner is two
and one-half yeards long and a yard
and one-half yards long and a yard
beautifully executed and fringed
with gold. v
