Steps Taken by Englandand the United StatesGreat Britain to Recognize the- MonroeDoctrine and Uncle Sum to Build theNicarajruan Canal and Allow England to Use It in Case of WarL0NDOX May 30 The Washingtoncorrespondent of the Daily Telegraphtelegraphing Sunday says I havejust learned from a high authority inthe state department that importantpreliminary steps toward an angloAmerican alliance have already heeniaken How far these negotiationsif they can yet be calledthat have proceeded it is not easy toascrtain for naturally strict secrecyis maintained but my information isthat the preliminary suggestions havebeen made and that the subject ofsuch an alliance is practically beforethe two governments in some shapeThe recent visits of Sir JulianPauncefote to the state departmenthave not it seems had reference altogether to the Canadian negotiationsAccording to my authority the featuresof the proposed alliance now beingconsidered are theseEngland is to recognize the Monroe doctrine to attempt no increase oflier territorial possessions in the western hemisphere and to indorse theAmerican construction of that doctrine The United States is to buildthe Nicaragua canal and Great Britainis to have the use of it in time ofwarThe United States is to have all thev territory taken from Spain in theent war and Great Britain is to pro-tect the United States in the possession if this should be threatened TheUnited States is to stand by EnglandSn her policy in China and the eastand all the British ports in the eastare to be opened to the United Statesunder the most favored nation clauseThe main features of an arbitrationtreaty are to be incorporated It hasbeen provided that all matters in dispute not involving the Monroe doctrine or the Nicaragua canal are tobe submitted to a non partisan commission The existing understandinghearing upon the relations betweenthe two governments on the greatJakes are to be abrogated and theUnited States are to be given the useof the Welland canal in case of warThe alliance is to be offensive anddefensive It proceeds on lines suchas the foregoing As a matter ofcourse all that has been done so far ispurely tentative but my informantgives the above as the general outlineCADIZ FLEETAccording to Report it is in Bad Shape toto Go Manila or Anywhere Else fort Some Weeks to CorucNew York May 30 -A dispatch tothe World

appropriating 3000000 for the purchase of suchvessels it will begin at once to acquirethem They are needed very badlyjust at present not so much for scouting purposes as for the protectionof the

statedthat although the government had noofficial information on the subjectthere was no reasonable doubt thatAdm Cerveras fleet was in Santiagoharbor and that Commodore Schleywas on guard at the

from official sources It wasalso stated that any contemplatedmovement against Cuba or Porto Ricowould be held in abeyance until theSpanish fleet either was destroyed orotherwise rendered helpless to

concerning the action off SanJuan officially posted at the navy department Friday morningUpon approaching San Juan itwas seen that none of the Spanish vessels were in the harbor I was considerably in doubt whether they hadreached San Juan and again departedfor some unknown destination orwhether they had not arrivedas tneir capture was the object oithe expedition and as it was essentialthat they should not pass to the westward I decided to attack the batteriesdefending the port in order to developtheir position and strength and thenwithout waiting to reduce the city orsubject k it to regular

Recognized the Spanish Vessels American Ships Guard theMouth of the HarborWashington May 30 The navy department has just received at 1230oclock this Monday morning a dispatch from Commodore Schley statingthat the Spanish fleet is in thebay of Santiago De Cuba and that hehas seen and recognized the vesselsWhile the naval officials have beenmorally certain for several days thatCerveras squadron was in theharbor of Santiago the officialannouncement from CommodoreSchley was received by theofficers on duty at the departmentwith intense satisfaction Assuranceis now doubly sure that the Spanishfleet is bottled up and that the cork isin the bottleIt is not believed that Adm Cerverawill attempt to escape from the predicament in which he now finds himself as such a course would surely result in tne destruction of his vesselsand the loss of many lives precious toSpain The suggestion is madehowever that the Spaniards may blowup his ships rather than have them fallinto the hands of Schley as they certainly will if they remain in the harborKingston Jamaica May 30 TheUnited States auxiliary cruiser formerly the American line steamer NewYork arrived here Saturday morningafter having left the American fleet atnoon FridayTwelve American war ships are nowoutside the harbor of Santiago De Cubaand Adm Cervera and the Spanishfleet are almost certainly inside Butnothing certain is known as to thecommunication which CommodoreSchley has had with the shore or as tothe number of Spanish fighting vessels which are bottled up in the harbor of Santiago De CubaIt is to be presumed that the Harvardhas important dispatches for the navalauthorities at WashingtonKey West Fla May 2S It is nowalmost certain that Commodore Schleyhas the Spanish fleet bottled up in theharbor of Santiago De Cuba There isso little doubt about this that the navalcampaign is proceeding upon the assumption that Adm Cervera is incapable of doing any harm Within a fewdays the exact conditions atSantiago De Cuba will be knownwithout a shadow of doubtIn spite of assertions to the contraryCommodore Schley was not absolutelysure of his game when he last communicated with Rr Adm Sampson andthe commodore will not take activesteps to block up the entrance of Santiago harbor until he is perfectly certain that Adm Cerveras ships are insideHowever he may have done this already as Commodore Schleys last comdays at Cienfuegfos He signaled tohis ships I believe the Spanish fleetis in the harbor5 On this belief amessage was sent to the Americanadmiral The details of how Commodore Schley found out that hewas mistaken are not yet known Atany rate acting- on the admirals instructions the commodore then movedeast arriving- outside Santiago DeCuba Wednesday morning May 25The topography of Cienfuegos andSantiago De Cuba is almost identicalBoth harbors are about six miles longwith narrow entrances about SOOyardswide And protected by high landA wnole fleet could lie in the harborof either place and be invisible fromthe outside After his experience atCienfuegos it is probable that Commodore Schley was very conservativein deciding whether or not he hadcaught Adm Cervera From the toneof his dispatches it is evident that thecommoaore soon gained much secondhand and external evidence whichpointed to Adm Cerveras presence inthe inner harbor The evidencewas apparently strong enough tomake the commodore feel certain theobject of his trip had been accomplished but in view of his previous experience he would not risk a decisivestatment until after ascertaining thefact for himself Before this dispatchis published it is likely that Comxnodore Schley has sent some vessel intothe entrance of the harbor of SantiagoDe Cuba or has obtained from a reliable source ashore information as tothe exact number and the names ofthe Spanish war ships sheltered by thehills about that place Contrary to thegenerally expressed opinion the harbor of Santiago De Cuba is poorlyprotectedThe Cruiser

English in N Y IndependentRobert touts STEVEn5aatsMilllpart inCHAPTER Xrn ContinuedThe captain was too bright to be inihe way He whipped out of sight in amoment leaving Silver to arrange theparty and I fancy it was as well he didmvself and look around me with some iinterest on the strange land that I wasinI had crossed a marshy tract full ofwillows bulrushes and odd outlandish swampy trees and I had now comeout upon the skirts of an open piece ofundulating sandy country about amile long dotted with a few pines anda great number of contorted trees notunlike the oak in growth but pale inthe foliage like willows On the farside of the open stood one of the hillswith two quaint craggy peaks shiningvividly in the sunI now felt for the first time the joyof exploration The isle was uninhabited my shipmates 1 had left behindand nothing lived in front of me butdumb brutes antf fowls I turnedhither and thither among the treesHere and there were flowering plantsunknownto me here and there I sawsnakes and one raised his head froma ledge of a rock and hissed at me withnAtn riTi1JVi fhf snirminf of apreW-vdeadly enemy and that the noise wasthe famous rattleThen I came to a long thicket of theseoak like trees live or evergreen oaksI heard afterward they should be calledwhich grew low along- the sand likebrambles the boughs curiously twisted the foliage compact like thatchThe thicket stretched down from thetop one of the sandy knolls spreadingand growing- taller as it went until itreached the margin of the broad reedyfen through which the nearest of thelittle rivers soaked its way into the anchorage The marsh was steaming inthe strong sun and the outline of theSpy glass trembled through the hazeAll at once there began to go a sort ofbustle among the bulrushes a wildduck flew up with a quack another followed and soon over the whole surfaceof the marsh a great cloud of birdshungscreamingand circling in theair I judged at once that some of myshipmates must be drawing near alongthe borders of the fen Nor was I deceived for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voicewhich as I continued to give ear grewsteadily louder and nearerThis put me in great fear and Icrawled under cover of the nearest liveoak and squatted there hearkening assilent as a mouseAnother voice answered and thenthe first voice which I now recognizedto be Silvers once more took up thestory and ran on for a long while in astream only now and again interrupted by the other By he sound themust have been talking earnestly andalmost tiercel j but no distinct wordcame to my hearingAt last the speakers seemed to havepaused and perhaps to have sat downso Had he been on deck he could no I for not only did they cease to draw anylonger so much as have pretended notto understand the situation It was asplain as day Silver was the captainand a mighty rebellious crew he had ofit The honest hands and I was soonto see it proved that there were suchon board must have been very stupidfellows Or rather I suppose the truthwas this that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleadersonly some more some less and a fewbeing good fellows in the main couldneither he led nor driven any furtherIt is one thing to be idle and skulk andquite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent menAt last however the party was madeup Six fellows were to stay on boardand the remaining 13 including Silverbegan to embarkThen it was that there came into myhead the first of the mad notions thatcontributed so much to save our livesIf six men were left by Silver it wasplain our party could not take and fightthe ship and since only six were leftit was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance It occurred to me at once to goashore In a jiffy I had slipped over thesidc and curled up in the fore sheetsof -the nearest boat and almost at theamegichent she shoved offNo Lj1 took notice of me only thebbwX6a saying Is that you JimJLveiyour head down 5ut fcuverthe other boat looked sharplyrand called out to know if thatere me and from that moment I began to regret what I had doneThe crews raced for the beach butthe boat I was in having some startand being at once the lighter and thebetter manned shot far ahead of herconsort and the bow had struck amongthe shore side trees and I had caughta branch and swung mjself out andJim Jiml I beard him shoutingplunged into the nearest thicket whileSilver and the rest were still 100 yardsbehindJim Jim I heard him shoutingHut you may suppose I paid no heedjumping ducking and breakingthrough I ran straight before mynose till I could run no longerCHAPTER XTVTHE FIRST BLOWI was so pleased at having given theelip to Long John that I began to enjoynearer but the birds themselves besranto grow more quiet and to settle againto their places in the swampAnd now I began to feel that I wasneglecting my business that since 1had been so foolhardy as to come ashorewith these desperadoes the least Icould do was to overhear them at theircouncils and my plain and obviousduty was to draw as close as I couldmanage under the favorable ambushof the crouching treesI could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly not only by thesound of their voices but by the behavior of the few birds that still hungin alarm above the heads of the intrudersCrawling on ail fours I madesteadily but slowly toward them tillat last raising my head to an apertureamong the leaves 1 could see cleardown into a little green dell beside themarsh and closely set about with treeswhere Long John Silver and anotherof the crew stood face to face in conversationThe sun beat full upon them Silverhad thrown his hat beside him on theground and his great smooth blondeface all shining with heat was liftedto the other mans in a kindpfjjappealMate he was sajing its becauseI thinks gold dust of you gold dustand you ma- lay to that If I hadnttook to 3ou like pitch do you think Idhave been here a warning of you Allsup you cant make nor mend its tosave -your neck that Im a speakingand if one of the wild tins knew itwhere ud I be Tom now tell mewhere ud I beSilver said the other man andI observed lie was not only red in theface but spoke as hoarse as a crow andhis voice shook too like a taut ropeSilver sajTs he youre old andyoure honest or has the name for itand youve money too which lots ofpoor sailors hasnt and youre braveor Im mistook And will you tell meyoull let yourself be led away withthat kind of a mess of swabs not youAs sure as God sees me Id sooner losemy hand If I turn again my dootyAnd then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise I had found one ofthe honest hands well here at thatsame moment came news of anotherPar away out in the marsh there aroseall of a sudden a sound like the crj ofanger then another on the back of itand then one horrid long drawnscream The rocks of the Spy glass reechoed it a score of times the wholetroop of marsh birds rose again darkening heaven with a simultaneouswhir and long after that death yellwas still ringing in my brain silencehad reestablished its empire and onlythe rustle of the redescending birdsand the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoonTom had leaped at the sound like ahorse at the spur but Silver had notwinked an eye He stood where hewas resting lightly on his crutchwatching his companion like a snakeabout to springJohn said the sailor stretchingout his handHands off cried Silver leapingback a yard as it seemed to me withthe speed and security of a trainedgymnastHands off ifyou like John Silversaid the other Its a black consciencethat can make you feared of me Butin Heavens name tell me what wasthatThat returned Silver smilingaway but warier than ever his eye amere pin point in his big face butgleaming like a crumb of glassThat Oh I reckon thatll be AlanAnd at this poor Tom flashed out likea heroAlan he cried Then rest hissoul ior a true seaman And as foryou John Silver long youve been amate of mine but youre mate of mineno more If I die like a dog Ill die inmy dooty Youve killed Alan haveyou Kill me too if you can But Idefies youAnd with that this brave fellowturned his back directly on the cookand set off walking for the beach Buthe was not destined to go far Withacry John seized the branch of a treewhipped the crutch out of his armpitscop Little did Lsuppose that he was a I and sent that uncouth missileburlingthrough the air It struck poor Tompoint foremost and with stunningviolence right between the shoulders Iin the middle of his back tHis handsflew up he gave a sort of gasp andfellWhether he was injured much orlittle none could ever tell Like enoughto judge from the sound his back wasbroken on the spot but he had no timegiven him to recover Silver agile asa monkey even without leg or crutchwas on the top of him the next momentand had twice buried his knife up to thehilt in that defenseless body From myplace of ambush I could hear him pantloudty as he struck the blowsI do not know what it rightly is tofaint but I do know that for the nextlittle while the whole world swamaway from before me in a whirlingmist Silver and the birds and the tallSpy glass hilltop going round andround and topsy turvy before my eyesand all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my earsWhen I came again to myself themonster had pulled himself togetherhis crutch under his arm his hat uponhis head Just before him Tom laymotionless upon the sward but themurderer minded him not a whitcleansing his blood stained knife thewhile upon a whisp of grass Everything else was unchanged the sun stillSilver buried his knife twice in that defenselessbodyshining mercilessly on the steamingjmarsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had actually beendone and a human life cruelly cutshort a moment since before my eyesBut now John put his hand into hispocket brought out a whistle and blewupon it several modulated blasts thatrang far across the heated air I couldnot tell of course the meaning of thesignal but it instantly awoke my fearsMore men would be Coming I mightbe discovered They had already slaintwo of the honest people after Tomand Alan might not I come next-andsilencecouid manage torhembreopen portion of the wood As I did soI could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades and this sound of danger lent mewings As soon as I was clear of thethicket I ran as I never ran beforescarce minding the direction of myflight so long as it led me from the murderers and as I ran fear grew andgrew upon me until it turned into akind of frenzyIndeed could an3one be more entirely lost than I When the gun firedhow should I dare go down to the boatsamong those fiends still smoking fromtheir crime Would not the first ofthem who saw me wring my neck likea snipes Would not my absence itselfbe an evidence to them of my alarmand therefore of my fatal knowledgeIt was all over I thought Good byto the Hispaniola good by to thesquire the doctor and thecaptain Therewas nothing left for me but death bystarvation or death by the hands of themutineersAll this while as I say I was stillrunning and without taking any notice fhad drawn near to the foot of thelittle hill with the two peaks and hadgot into a part of the island where thewild oaks grew more widely apart andseemed more like forest trees in theirbearings and dimensions Mingledwith these were a few scattered pinessome 50 some nearly 70 feet high Theair too smelled more freshly thandown beside the marshAnd here a fresh alarm brought me toa standstill with a thumping heartCHAPTER XVTHE MAN OF THE ISLANDFrom the side of the hill which washere steep and stonj a spout of gravelwas dislodged and fell rattling andbounding through the trees My eyesturned instinctively in that directionand I saw a figure leap with great rapidity behind the trunk of a pine What itwas whether bear or man or moUkey Icould in no wise tell It seemed darkand shaggy more I knew not But theterror of the new apparition broughtme to a standI was now it seemed cut off uponboth sides behind me the murderersbeforemethis lurkingnondescript Andimmediately I began to prefer the dangers that I knew to those I knew notSilver himself appeared less terrible incontrast with this creature of thewoods and I turned on vay heel andlooking sharply behind me over myshoulder began to retrace my steps inthe direction of the boatsInstantly the figure reappeared andmaking a wide circuit began to headme off I was tired at any rate buthad I been as fresh as when I rose 1could see it was in vain forme to contend in speed such an adversary Fromtrunk to trunk the creature flitted likea deer running man like on two legsbut unlike any man that I had everseen stooping almost double as it ranYet a man it was I could no longer bein doubt about thatvI began to recall what I had heard ofcannibals I was withinan -ace of call-77lTHE BOURBON NEWS PAEIS KT TUESDAY MA SL 1898ving for help But the mere fact thathe was a man however wild had somewhat reassured me and my fear of Silver began to revive in proportion Istood Still therefore and cast aboutfor some method of escape and as Iwas so thinking the recollection of mypistol flashed into my mind As soonas I remembered I was not defenselesscourage glowed again in my heartand I set my face resolutely for thisman of the island and walked brisklytoward himHe was concealed by this time behind another tree trunk but he musthave Taeen watching me closely for assoon as I began to move in his directionhe reappeared and took a step to meetme Then he hesitated drew backcame forward again and at last temy wonder and confusion threw himself on his knees and held out hiclasped hands in supplicationAt that I once more stoppedWho are you I askedBen Gunn he answered and hisvoice sounded hoarse and awkward likea rusty lock Im

fairest bonniest lassThat mortal ever knewThe roses blush was on her cheeksHer eyes had caught the blueOf June time skies around her headBright golden ringlets dancedAnd when my sweetheart smiled on meI felt my heart entrancedI found her sitting neath the treesOne glorious day in MayThe breezes with her dancing curlsWere merrily at playI looked at her with steadfast gazeShe turned her eyes on meThey brimmed with love our warm lipsmetIn kisses one two threeThat day was years and years agoBut I can neer forgetMy first sweethearts bewitching eyesAnd oh I love her yetAs fervently as in those

bottomof the sea formed an important factorin the household economy of the aborigines and in almost every burial placeon the coast asphaltum is found Thenatives on the islands obtained theirstipply from the water and at the present day the rocks at various places canbe seen splashed with asphaltum whichhas drifted in This is particularly noticeable after an east wind showingthat there is a large area in the deepSanta Catalina channel from whichasphaltum oozes upOil wells were sunk at Santa Paulasome 3earsago and later andiscoveredyat Puenteand again at Summerland below SantaBarbara where a singular state of affairs existsIt soon became apparent at the lattelocalitj that the oil bearing stratumstretched out into the sea and drill scaffolding looking like windmills without sails began in a short time to extend down the little canyon and to creepup the shore in the direction of SantaBarbara At first they kept along thesides of the hills which breast the seathere but gradually they turned seaward until one more adventurous thanthe rest rose from the waterWork was started at an extremely lowtide aud finally the tall scaffolding appeared 20 or 30 feet from the shore rising-fromthe

ofImproving RoadsIn the states in which a sjstem ofstate aid has been inaugurated the urban resident bears his share of the expense of improving- and maintaining thehighways instead of leaving them asheretofore to be cared for by the ruralpopulation Under the old theory thatthe maintenance and care of the roadsshould depend wholly on the districtsthrough which they passed great injustice was done many persons whoseinterest in the roads was less than thatof others who bore no expense To remove this injustice and provide an equable system is the purpose of the stateaidSpdaking on this subject recentlyGen Stone said that the farmers ofr - --Ml IA MODEL HIGHWAYFrom a Photograph by the Chairman ofthe Pennsylvania Highway CommitteeMaine own one fifth of the property ofthe state and that one fifth of the property has paid the entire expense ofbuilding and maintaining the roads ofthe state which are just as necessary tothe people who live in towns and thepeople of other occupations than farm-ing as they are to the farmer Concern-ing New York he said that there thefarmers own only one fourteenth ofthe property of the state and that everyi farmer has been making roads for 13other men to travel on and he is gettingtired of doing it He is now about tostop it and he finds the people of thecities and large towns the manufacturing people and the commercial peopleready to bear their share of the expense of improving the country roadsThe only drawback is that the farmersthemselves have been afraid to let anychange be made in the road laws of thecorgrv for they imagined that thePple f the cities design to imposeiavier burdens on them instead ofjing ready to help them carry exist-a Sg onesBy degrees all classes of the peoplewill begin to better understand eachother on the subject and will get closertogether It was not strange at firstthat country people should be supieiousof city people who took the trouble totell them how much they would bebenefited by better roads it was natural for them to think that such philanthrop3 was not wholly disinterestedBut as it becomes daily more evidentthat all classes trades and occupations will reap the advantages resultingfrom improxfcag the highways that theultimate burden will not be increasedand that all are ready to share it themovement will acquire an impetus thatwill insure its future success

should confess himself the perpetrator of crime is natural enoughThe prospect of relief from actual painis a temptation that blinds the suffererto the future But it may seem strangeand is indeed one

committed Such in England was the case ofJohn Perry executed near Campden in1GG1 with his mother and brother formurdering William Harrison stewardfor Lady Campden The testimonyagainst them was chiefly the confessionof Jofhn Perrv himself but to the astonishment of all Harrison who had beenkidnaped and carried off returned twoyears after the executionIn 1S12 a man named Colvin living atManchester XL disappeared and suspicions of foul play were entertainedPublic opinion attributed his murder toStephen and Jesse Boorn Still asthere was no definite ground on whichto arrest them the excitement gradually died away In 1S19 however a MrBoorn dreamed that he had been murdered by two men whom h fixed upons his neplhews Stephen and Jesse Theghost of the murderer even specified theplace of the murder and the old cellarhole where the mangled body had beenthrust There a knife and buttons werefound which were identified as belonging to Colvin On this the men were arrested Stephen and Colvin had quarreled just before the -disappearance oftlhe latter and Stephen had been seento strike him with a club and knockhim downIn a short time Jesse confessed thathe and Stephen with their father afterStephen knocked him down had carriedhim to the old cellar and cut his throatwith a jack knife and further statedtihat next year they made way with mostof the bones of their victim Stephenafter a
