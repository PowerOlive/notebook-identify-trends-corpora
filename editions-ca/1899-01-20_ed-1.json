MONKEYS OF INDIA
THE HAVOC THEY CAUSE BY THER
WARS FOR WIVES
LanRhalile Tactics Employed by the
Natives to Disperse tlie Belligerent
Packs Little Chance For Male Mon
keys at Birth
Monkeys in India are an unmitigated
nuisance especially in the country I
have often come across in the jungles
adjoining the villages of northern Ben
gal whole troops of them whose depre
dations in fields and orchards were the
despair of the unfortunate villagers
These troops always consisted of one
huge male and about 100 females The
fact is when a little monkey is born in
the pack it is suffered to live if a fe
male but instantly killed by the father
if it happens to be a male The mother
however sometimes manages to hide
the little one until he is able to get
about and then sends him away before
the big male catches sight of him In
this way it often happens that indi
vidual males are to be found living by
themselves in single blessedness Now
getting tired of solitude after a time
and perhaps believing in union as a
source of strength these bachelors often
join together and form a pack of their
own as a sort of club
Then the fun begins They want
wives very naturally But how are
they to get them All the female
monkeys of the country belong to the
harem of some big brute or other
Clearly the only solution is to attack
such a harem kill the gotha the afore
said big brute and then divide the
spoils So an ultimatum is sent and
rejected War is declared The battle
is a fierce one and often lasts several
days The party attacked always tries
to retreat and often traverses several
jungles fields and even villages But
the pursuit is hot and vigorous and at
last a stand has to be made sometimes
in a village green or even an orchard of
some country mansion In the actual
fight the females generally remain
faithful to their lord and master and
help him fiercely against his numerous
assailants But the result is a foregone
conclusion and the several widows
after a ver short period of mourning
usually manifested by a show of ill
temper are consoled by the victorious
males
Now these battles cause sad havoc to
the fields and orchards of the country
and often prove a positive danger to the
people for though monkeys seldom at
tack men woe to the luckless one who
ventures to come near them in their
deadly struggle Moreover when pressed
by hunger these packs are not to be
trifled with You may not mind even
the damage done to your orchard by
hundreds of monkeys gobbling up every
thing they can lay their hands on but
it is quite a different matter when you
have to shut your doors and windows
and stay in for days at a time because of
the anny outside
Consequently the object of the natives
is to break up these packs by capturing
their leaders Killing is against the dic
tates of conscience but capture is not
especially as the monkey is liberated in
a short time as will appear presently
So when a pack is about the natives em
ploy the following method Close to an
orchard a bit of level space is selected
and a hole dug in it about 2 feet deep
and 6 or 8 inches in diameter A noose
is made at one end of a long stout cord
and placed over the mouth of the hole
The cord is then passed through a pulley
or ring attached to a tree close to the
house and the other end held some dis
tance away by a concealed person The
noose and about 10 or 15 feet of the
cord are covered with sand Then a nice
tempting banana is placed in the hole
and a number of rotten ones covered
however with fresh skins are strewn
all over the ground near the hole
When the pack comes the females
are too shy to venture out into the open
pace near the house but the big gotha
is a brave fellow He sees the bananas
on the ground leaps down takes up one
throws it away in disgust then another
with the same result Suddenly he no
tices the nice tempting ne in the hole
and plunges his arm in Immediately
the cord is pulled the noose fastened
on the arm close to the shoulder and the
monkey dragged willy nilly to the tree
Tvhcrc tbs pulley or ring fc atched
Then the hiding shikari comes forth
and circling round and round the tree
with the cord held tight in his hand
binds the unfortunate monkey safe and
fast ajl Lut the head The pvrfley or
ring is iatroduced not merely to bind
the monkey to the tree but also because
it would be highly dangerous to drag
the infuriated brute right up to a per
son
The monkey however is not killed
Instead they lather his head amd face
no special care being taken in selecting
the finest soap or the purest water The
operation is an interesting one and a
source of great amusement to the by
standers The monkey however dodges
his head about only to get a good dose
of soap in his eyes and mouth Then he
has enough of it especially as he feels
dreadfully achy all over and the cords
cutting into his body every inch to
say nothing of the personal remarks and
the highly adjectival language of the
bystanders He submits to his fate with
eastern stoicism His head is shaved
clean as a billiard ball and then the
face as well nice and smooth like a
babys Then they let him go But alas
such is the vanity of life his wives
will not have him now that his beauty
is gone They disown him completely
cut him dead Nay they drive him
away from the pack with contumely
with the ends of their tails in the ab
sence of domestio broomsticks And
thus being without a leader the pack
is soon broken up Strand Magazine

an accurate record exists was made la
