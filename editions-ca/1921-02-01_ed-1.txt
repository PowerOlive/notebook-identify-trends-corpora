We quote the followingfrom one of the leading trade journals: "Leading authorities in merchandise are sure that prices m mostcommodities will increase later.They base this belief on the factthat everybody is down right to bedrock in the matter of supplies. People have been holding off on thepurchase of clothing, of householdnecessities and almost everythingelse. The time soon will come whenthey have to replenish their supplies, and this inevitably is going tomean aTbuying rush. The price oflabor is not being reduced to anygreat extent. Neither is the cost ofraw mateiial coming down appreci-"U wo-ild seem, theheforc, thatthe person who builds great hopeson things falling much lower, orwho is holding off in his purchasingbecause of a belief that such a dropwill come, is 'due for some disappointment." The only reason v. e can see for inr.Tirosfint low prices is because themerchants are selling below cost in jcrder to get money to pay foi tneirspring stock, and when these areplaced on the mavk.-.t within the nextfew weeks they must be sold at aprofit, and, therefoie, prices arevery apt to be higher than they are'at present.MEETING OP BLUE GRASS DENTAL SOCIETY.The Bh.e Grass Dental Societyheld its annual banquet and election of officers at the Phoenix Hotelball room Saturday night.

S. SAMOAReporter and Naval Officer Tryto Get Control of th'e. Administration.ODD MIXUP IS CLEARED UPGovernor, in III Health and UnderCharges, 'Commits Suicide Is Completely Absolved by NavalCourt of Inquiry.San Francisco. American Samoa'sbeetle-inspecting chief of police is outof jail, and the judge, who 1ms sevenother jobs, is again holding court, according to advices from Tutuila? Thischange back to normal followed a naval inquiry which resulted in dissipating an attempt by a naval officer anda former newspaper reporter to control the naval administration of theAmerican possession in the SouthSeas.In furtherance of this attempt, thenaval officer, Creed II. Boucher, lieutenant commander, aud the ex-reporter,Arthur A. Greene, enlisted thesupport of Commander A. C. Kail,second in rank to Commander Warren J. Terhune, governor of theisland. The three filed charges againstTerhune and his administration, andfinally Kail tried to send a wirelessmessage to the navy department atWashington, branding his superior asinsane.Takes His Own Life.With the message in front of him,Terhune, suffering from ill health,committed suicide. The pitiful partof this tragedy developed when thenaval court of inquiry, already enroute to Tutuila from Hawaii, absolved Terhuue's administration of allcharges, recommended the deportationof Greene, the court martial of Boucher and the removal of Kail from hispost.Among the charges filed againstTerhune's administration was onethat officials were drawing illegal salaries. J. Hurkln Mailo, native chiefof police, and Judge A. N. Noble wereespecial targets of Boucher, Greeneand Kail.After Commander Terhune shot himself Kail became acting governor, andhe jailed Mailo on charges that thechief of police had urged the nativesto oppose the activities of Greene andKail. Previously Boucher had allegedthat irregularities of the Terhune administration included paying Mailo as"beetle inspector" as well as head ofthe police force, but that no beetleswere inspected.Judge Noble, who, besides being district judge, was secretary to the commandant, registrar of titles, secretaryof native affairs, judge of the probatecourt, superintendent of education, associate member of the high court andvice president of the American Bankof Samoa, was charged by Boucherand Greene with being instrumentalin alleged misuse of funds and authority. Kail closed Noble's courtwhen the former became acting governor. Board Sits Eight Days.The board of inquiry sat for eightdays. Testimony revealed that Boucher for 23 of his 83 days' service,was under suspension on threecharges carrying a pistol, attemptinga mutiny and falsehood. Boucher'sexamination revealed that he posed asa secret service man without authority: publicly criticized the secretaryof the navy and the President; insubordinately communicated with authorities in Washington in violationof regulations, and committed manyother breaches of naval regulations.Upon examination he declined toanswer many questions on the groundthat the answers would incriminatehimself. He acknowledged that allcharges he made were based imonhearsay and without investigation.It was revealed that documents werestolen from naval officers, but an attempt to introduce these by Greene,who acted as Boucher's counsel, wasoverruled by the board.The testimony revealed also thatGreene and Boucher created unrestamong the natives in an effort toI change the government and assumecontrol for themselves. Their activities resulted in organization of nativesinto a "committee" which forwardedan appeal to President Wilson to remove Governor Terhune, and the na-I tive unrest was manifested by severalfights with the American sailors.t r..i: ,!. , , ,wuuiny x waicnncion in oanuary.Peru, Ind.

Another search fortreasure-trove a sunken Spanish galleon laden with stolen doubloons hasbegun on the Atlantic coast of Florida, between Deerfield and BocaRatone.Romance has lured this time agroup of adventurous men of Deerfield and thereabouts to dig in theocean's bottom for the buccaneers' pirate ship, which tradition says hadhauled too close to the treacherous'shores when pursued. A syndicateformed for the search has begun operations where the galleon is supposedto have sunk in the sands.This is only one of the many suchadventures off the south Florida coastwhich in the old days, before the advent of lighthouses, was the scene ofmany wrecks. Treasure seekers havebrought in a few ancient hulls whichhad been deeply buried in sand, somedating back five or six centuries. Butso far no ship thus recovered hasyielded anything except ancient wood.One prospector is said to have spenttwo fortunes near Stuart before quitting the romantic1 game.Fulford, 11 miles north of Miami,has been the scene of many searches.Tradition has it that a pirate ship escaped pursuers by sailing up a creeknear Fulford where the crew celebrated by getting drunk.Seminole Indians boarded the vesseland massacred the crew, except one,the story runs, and the escaped piratesucceeded in rescuing the ship's treasure chest filled with gold which heburied near by, making a diagram ofthe spot. Unable to return, the pirateis said to have given the diagram toa friend.This has been used by severalsearching parties, equipped with everykind of a gold finder, but they failedto locate the treasure.A native, living near by, says thespot is haunted and that even nowthe ghosts of the pirates howl andgroan when one nears it.lie says no one is ever going to getthe treasure as the ghosts "carry onsomething terrible when you get closeto it, and there is no telling what theywould do if they got their hands onit.

Sixteen explorationexpeditions are now in progress orin contemplation after four years ofinactivity in this line of scientific research due to the great war. Mostof these enterprises have been undertaken or projected since the armistice,and they recall the fact that motherearth still has important biological,zoological, geological, ethnological andmeteorological problems to be solved.Onp of the most iranortant of theseenterprises is the British Antarctic ,expedition, headed by CommanderJohn Lachlan Cope, F. R. G. S., formerly of the British navy. It is n-nanced for $750,000, includes fiveships, 125 men, several airplanes andextensive wireless apparatus. Theundertaking is to require five yearsand its objects are the circumnavigation of the Antarctic sea, a dashto the south pole, the locating of newwhaling grounds and the discoveryof supposedly rich gold, silver, coaland ruby fields.Capt. Roald Amundsen, who discovered the south pole in 1911, left Nome,Alaska, last August in an attempt toreach the north pole. His ship, theMaud, had already spent nineteenmonths in the Arctic, north of Asiaand Europe, and had successfully madethe northeast passage. He expectedthe Maud to be locked in the ice packand to drift toward the pole whenthe Arctic winter ended. In negotiating his way to Nome he was frequently compelled to blast a paththrough the ice.Captain Amundsen was last heardpf off East cape, about 170 miles northwest of Nome in the Bering strait.The explorer, on account of high wagesand scarcity of men, was handicappedby lack of help, his only companionsbeing three sailors and an Eskimocook.Other Prospects on Foot.The other interesting expeditionsprojected or now under way are asfollows :Siberia Capt. Axel Landmark andCapt. John Vatney, in a 50-foot powerboat are on a 4,000-miie voyage xmKolyma river, using a primitive chartmade in 1878 by Nordenskjold, a Swedish explorer onhls voyage from Norway to Japan via the Arctic ocean. 'Greenland Knud Rasmussen, Danish explorer, who returned from theeast coast late in 1919, after studyingEskimo tribes, is preparing for another expedition of five years' duration. Lange Koch, another Dane, isplanning a scientific survey of NorthGreenland, his main purpose being toestablish Danish sovereignty in thatterritory.Africa Four expeditions are in progress, namely, the Mackie ethnologicalexpedition to Central Africa for thepurpose of studying the Bahima, oneof the chief pastoral tribes of Ankole, a district west of Uganda; theBritish natural history of museum expeditions to the west coast and theJeb-Maria mountains; the duke ofAbruzzi's effort to find the sources ofthe Webi Shebell river, which flowsfrom Abyssinia through Italian Somaliland into the Indian ocean, and theentomological tour of the Belgian portion of Tanganyika and the easternCongo, by T. A. Barns, who exploredthe Iruri and Semliki forests, findinga strange race of pigmy savages, aswell as gathering a wonderful 'collection of moths and butterflies.Baffin Land Donald P. MacMlllan,who was with Admiral Peary plans tostart next year to explore one of therichest fields in the far north. Heexpects to establish a camp 700 milessouth of Etah in Northwest Greenland,where his Crocker Land expeditionpassed four winters. He will attemptto circumnavigate Baffin Land andpenetrate 1,500 miles of its westerncoast.Nova Zembla Dr. Olaf Holtedahl ofChristiania university is organizing anorthwestern natural science and geological expedition to this country andplans to start next summer.Mexico Prof. Emelio Oddone, afamous Neapolitan seismologist, representing the Italian government, is nowstudying the earthquake, situation inMexico by means of. his "inerviameter," an invention by which he is ableto measure both motion and energy.Technology, who will investigate seed"and volatile oils.Ecuador and Peru Collections offlora and fauna are now being gathered for the American Museum ofNatural History in New York by CaptHarold E.
