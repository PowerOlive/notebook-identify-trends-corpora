PARIS MERCHANTS DO AN
IMMENSE CHRISTMAS TRADE
."Paris merchants, as a whole, enjoy
ed a very lucrative Christmas trade.
Since Monday until Wednesday night
there was a steady stream of Christ
mas shoppers which thronged the
shops and stores from early in the
Tnorning tmtil late at night. A very
significant feature was that there was
an absence of the usual Christmas
rush. Clerks in the stores weie
kept busy all during the day, shoppers
taking advantage of the "early hours
to do their Christmas buying: The
late shoppers were few and a 'great
relief was felt from this source.
"Merchants in every line report a
larger business than at any previous
. holiday season. 'Out-of-town people
attracted by the. most complete lines
in every department offered by the
Paris (merchants were much in .evi
dence during the last -shopping days
before Christmas.
The local postoflice did the largest
8S.rei n m x0u.s. 'Xiojsiu; ui ssanisnq
degree was augmented by the parcel
post, the recent ruling giving patrons

For the past three days the entire
office force with a number of assis
tants have been- kept going constantly
to handle J:he Volume of outgoing and
incoming mails. Wednesday three
special deliveries, were established to
dispose of the parcels post packages
received- at the local office and it
was only by extreme measures that
the oflicials were able to get the mail

DANGEROUS $10 COUNTERFEIT i
BILL IN CIRCULATION
Paris 'merchants arc warned to be
ware of a new and especially danger
ous counterfeit $10 note, with wbich
the large cities of this Staae and of
Ohio have -been flooded, and which
will, as a matterot course, reach the
smaller towns.
United States Secret Service Agent
S. A. Donnella. of Louisville, well
known here, received notice from the
department that such a bill was "being
jcirculatfed. He went to Cincinnati,
and found that within aiblodc othe
Federal Building the city had beeen
flooded with the counterfeit notes.
Mr. Donnella returned to Louisville
and immediately sent out a warning
to all Kentucky towns and cities.
The new counterfeit is a $10 United
States note of the recent Lewis and
Clarke issue, commemorative of the
Lewis and Clark Exposition at Port
land, Oregon. It has a buffalo as a
central figure. The counterfeit is of
series 1901, check letter "C," plate
number 634, and the bogus bills are
al 1 of the same serial number, D,
12449671. They purport to be signed
by J. C. Napier, Register of the
United States Treasury, and Lee Mc
Clung, Treasurer of the United
States.
The spurious notes are printed on
ordinary bond paper. The color of
the seal and counter is a brick red,
instead of carmine, as in the genuine.
The silk fibers are counterfeited by
pen and ink marks in red, blue and
black. Where the bills are dark,
they are altogether too black and
th:,s black has a glossy appearance.
The counterfeit is one of the phot
etched variety, has a "raggy" feel,
and a slightly scratchy appearance.
It is usually soiled to conceal de
fects. In the small towns and cities the
small shops, as cigar stands, candy
shops, drug stores, etc., are the usual
victims. The counterfeits are always
detected when they reach the banks,
but the ordinary observer would not
notice that they . were bogus.
RAILROADS LOSE IN
TAX INCREASE CASE-
Federal Judge A. M. J. Cochran,
sitting in chambers in Maysville, Sat
urday, for the Eastern District of
Kentucky, heard oral arguments in
case of the Cincinnati, New Orleans
& Texas Pacific Railway Company
asking a permanent injunction re
straining the State of Kentucky from
increasing the road's assessment for
1912.
After listening to the arguments of
both sides the court decided he com
pany must pay taxes on the increase
of $2,000,000 already assessed before
the injunction would be sustained.
The road by this decision will pay
taxejs on a franchise assessment
amounting to $5,529,320, while the
State Board's assessment was for
$10,574,200. The Chesapeake &
Ohio Railroad Company alo prayed
for an injunction against an increase
in its franchise assessment from
$2,743,350 to $18,798,000. The court
raised its assessment to $5,000,000.

$36.25 per head. .
Thos. McClintock, of Millersburg,-
bought in Mt. Sterling, Monday, ten,
head of work mules, at prices ranging
from $150 'to $200 each,
Richard & Wills, of Paris, bought
from Montgomery parties, this week,
three head of mules at from $150 to
$180 each, and a plug horse ats$H0.
The Richmond Register says:
"Mr. W. C. Bennett sold last week to
Benton, Evans & Brandenburg, 30
head of export cattle, weight 1,400
pounds, at $8.15 a hudnerd. This is
the highest price paid this year on
the local market to our knowledge."
The sum of $400 per acre was
the price- realized for the eighteen
acres of land located on the Harrods
burg pike, sold by Master Commis
sioner R. J. Colbert, in Lexington,
Saturday to Mr. George H. Whitney.
The land is located about two miles
from Lexington. .
The fine young brood mare, Re
bellion, by Star Shoot, out of Magna
Charter by Hindoo, has been pur
chased from the Thoroughbred Rec
ord, by Mr. Hal P. Headley, of Lex
ington, and will be sent to his Beau
mont Stock Farm, near Lexington,
where she will be bred to Jack At
kins. The champion stallion, Nala, has
been presented by his owner, Ed
ward B. McLean, of New York, to the
United States Government, and will
be placed in the stud at Fort Collins,
Colorado, for breeding purposes. The
announcement was made at the sale
held recently in New York, when Mr.
McLean disposed of his stud.
Two Clark County formers told
the Sun that -they believed the fabu
lous amount of corn claimed to have
been produced on one acre by some
one of the prize winners existed only
in the imagination. They felt about
it like the old farmer who, after gaz
ing at a strange exhibit in a circus
cage, remruea: mere am x no
such animal."
There is an old saying among
weather obseryers that a drouth is al
ways followed by a mild winter; also
by a big crop year. It is too soon as
yet to determine the character of the
winter weather, although a good start
has been made in vindication of the
adace. As to bie crons to follow novt
summer we must onlv wait and "see
what we shall see."

States, and their rank, according to
the census of 1910, is as follows:
Texas, 700,000; Missouri, 315,000;
Tenessee, 290,000; Kentucky, 205,
000; Illinois, 105,000; and Indiana,
60,000? New Orleans, St. Louis, and
Atlanta are the le&Gmg mule mar
kets. Kentucky could well afford to
increase lier prestige in mule rais
ing. We ought to be able to grow
as many mules as Tennessee. What
is the matter with starting a boom in
the mule business?"

SURVIVOR
Of Old Molll Mtt Ganf Tafcts .Otw
t Year Prison Trm.-'
The last survivor of Chicagois first
j fully organized band of criminal wh
flourished a generation and under the
pisturesque Mollie Mott, passed from
the stage Friday. Michael Sage,
white of hair and showin geveryone of
his 63 years, made no defense against
a sentence of one year in he 'Chi
cago House of Correction. His active
days are over,, in the opinion-of the"
police, even if he lives out his sen
tence. Half of Sage's life has bee spent
in prison. He began stealing whea
he was 12 years old, and never learn
ed anything else.
The old man was arrested Wednes
day night for attempting to burglar
ize a residence.
The Mott gang of pickpockets,
thieves, burglars, hold-up men and,
general utility thugs 20 years ago'
lived the scenes that usually are
found in dime novels, and no member
of the gang was mose resourceful in
crime than gjage. Mollie Mott, by her
beauty and personality, led the gang,
and was he cause of more than one
affray between. jealous followers.
The gang's success bred emulation,
and other criminals formed theii
selves ino a band known in poilce an-
I nals as the Shelvin gang; The gangs
xought the police and each other un
til Mollie's charms conauered one nf
the Shelvin gang and brought the two
tribes under her harmonious scepter.
Relentless war with the police, dis-
ease ? d Prison-, cells in succeeding
years broke up the band and its mem
bers, for the most part are dead or,
at least, passed from the ken of the
local police. Sage is the last one
they know of, and they fear him no
more.
