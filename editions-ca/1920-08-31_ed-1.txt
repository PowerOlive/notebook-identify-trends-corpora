ARCHDEACON BROS ,(31-2t) Tenth Street, Paris, Ky.SkirtsCARLISLE VISITED BY DISAS-TROUS CLOUDBURSTThe residential and business section of Carlisle suffered a propertyloss variously estimated from S350, -000 to $500,000, in a cloudburstwhich visited the city Friday night.Equally as great damage was doneto property in the county by therushing waters. Brushy Fork Creekrunning directly through the city,became a rushing torrent of muddywater in a few moments.The burst of water from theheavens was the worst and mostdestructive in the history of Kentucky. So swift was the rise of water that horses and cattle in the Louisville & Nashville railroad yardswere caught and drowned beforeraihoad men could release themfrom their pens. Most of Carlisle's inhabitants had retired forthe night when the cloud burst,heralded by terrific thunder clapsand vivid lightning, suddenly engulfed the town. Houses were lifted from their foundations and agreat river coursed through thestreets. 'Thirty houses were washedaway, but their tenants were rescued. A number of Carlisle men losttheir autos, the machines being literally washed away. On a trackageof less than three miles, 15 bridges,railroad and county, were borntjaway by the -water. Lumber yardswere stripped of their contents. TheL. & N. railroad and the Carlisleelectric light plant were floodedunder 20 feet of water.The Littlejohn Carnival Company, which was closing a week'sengagement there was a heavy loser,everything on the grounds excentthe Fen is wheel and merry-go-roundbeing swept away.. Someof the carnival property was foundSunday morning near Millersburg,eight miles away from the scene ofdisaster."Witnesses saw a seven-ton roadl oiler, which had been swept half ablock, striking a building in whichit knocked a hole, and a horse whichwas swept from its feet and carriedone square, landing upright in abig delivery truck.Among the large establishmentswhich suffeied serious loss wasMartin's garage, where fifty carswere under water.A number of horses were drownedat Ham's livery stable.The house of John Kern wasstruc by lighning and destroyed byfire.Among those rescued were persons attending the carnival company's show and who were marooned in the Ferris wheel. They weierqmoved from their perilous position with the greatest difficulty.Rescue after lescue, attendedwith great danger, was-, made in someinstances, men with ropes scaledwalls to reach the marooned inhabitants. Among those who weretrapped in the upper apartments oftheir homes by the rushing waterwere Mayor Al. Peters and his family. They were rescued by meansof ladders. On the south side ofMain street the flood reached highest and poured into second-story-windows. In many instances theterrified people in that section of thetown sought safety on the roofswhile their dwellings shook underthe pounding of the water.Since the subsiding of the floodCarlisle has presented a scene of devastation of such extent that thejstunned property owners have notbeen able to take accurate stock oftheir losses. Hundreds of sightseers from Paris visited CarlisleSaturday and Sunday and reportedthe scene as being one almost beyond describing.oA SURE START ASSURED.Do you want your car to swinginto action quickly, consistently,dependably?

L. Moore, Jr., distillery warehousein this county Wednesday morningabout 1 o'clock. Revenue men arehere from Louisville, Lexington andother places, and Sheriff Clell Coleman and other local officers are cooperating with them in an effort tolocate the whisky bandits. The truckof whisky was tracked to Harrodsburg by a peculiar mark of the tiresin the dust and mud. Here the trialwas lost, but it is believed that thewhisky is not far away from thisplace.It took about two hours to load thetruck with the whisky, which showed by tracks it had been backed upto the warehouse door, and while theloading was going on Young andLawrence were held prisoners in theoffice by three masked men. Theleader wrapped and smoked a number of cigarettes, and joked with hisprisoners. He said to them: "Youtwo are nice ducks to take UncleSam's money to guard a distillery.You guys couldn't guard d babybuggy."When the truck was loaded andthe raiders were leaving Lawrenceasked that his pistol be restored, asit was borrowed. The robber removed the cartridges and handed himthe revolver with the warning. "You'dbetter be good."It is said fifteen barrels of whiskywas stolen worth, at bottling prices,$20 a quart. Every precaution wastaken by the raiders to prevent interference, as the telephone wireswere cut and Nightwatchman Law-ences automobile was disabled sothey could not be pursued.oSome things are not as easy isthey look.

'There are people who take vacations in the winter, or in the spring,or in the fall, just as there are people who work at night and sleep byday. But for the most of us thesummer, or some part of the summer, has always been the vacationseason. This year the high cost ofliving has prevented many personsfrom putting aside a vacation fund.What shall they do with the holiday period that is confrontingthem?We shall not offer suggestions ofa soit to prick people on to make asacrifice. We shall not urge thosewho are hesitating and unenthusiastic over the vacation outlook tospend their time gardening orworking on farms in order that thethreatened food shortage may beeverted. We have in mind thos-svn.rntinns nrfi ton hripf to rermHthem to be very serviceable as gardeners or farm hands and whose employment is sufficiently exacting tomake a period of relaxation desirable. Let us assume that they willhave to stay at home this summer,a-nd that the various sports andgames, such as baseball, golf andtennis, are not available for theirdiversion.There are three things that thevacationists who must stay at bornein the city can do. One is to makedaily excursions on foot into thethe surrounding country as far ashis will and strength will carryhim. A walking trip daily with thesame point of departure and returnmay seem dull. But there are verylew people wno know tneir owncities well and still fewer who arethoroughly familiar with the surrounding country. To take a different ten or twelve-mile walk everyday for two weeks is not an impossibility for the city dweller.He has, too, the opportunity toread extensively and at leisure. Hehas perhaps read -all the books inhis own library, does not want tore-read them and cannot afford tobuy new ones. But in the city thereis a public library about which hemay know little. Eefore he goes forhis daily walk, or after he returnsfrom it, he might spend some tijmein the public library. There aretwo or three famous novels that hehas always wanted to read; here ishis opportunity.A third resource for the' vacationist at home might be the art museum of the city. He does not knowanything about painting or sculpture. No; but it is not impossiblefor him to learn. He should notthink that one visit to the museumwill teach him everything or anything. He should go as often as hecan during the vacation; he shouldsit down in front of any picturethat he likes and let himself dreamabout it, with the sense that there isnothing in the world awaiting himor pressing for his attention, andthat for a vacationist there are nopleasures that surpass those of theeye and the mind.NEW PROCESS GAS STOVES THEVERY BEST.Get the New Process gas stoves todo your heating.

Officials of Jefferson county were in Frankfort recently to discuss the question withthe State Tax Commission and although no definite decision wasmade, the commission decided thatthe ratifications of railroad valuations should bear the 1919 rate instead of the rate for this year.Before 1918, when the StateBoard of Valuation and Assessmentmade the assessments, the railroadsmade reports on which the assessments were based in October and theassessments were made by March ofeach year. In order to conform tothe rates of the federal governmentthe v reports are now made betweenDecember 31 and March 31 and thecertifications made by the commission during the summer.Through an error of some sort therecords show a gap of one year andthis caused the question to beraised as to whether the taxes werefor 11S or 120.fn m asSAYS WOMEN WILL BECOMEGOOD CITIZENSThe Courier-Journal says:"When the full realization comesto the women of Kentucky of theprivilege which is now theirs, to casttheir first vote in a Presidential election in the interest of so noble acause as the establishment and maintenance of the peace of the world, itseems certain that they will not failin their dutyas citizens."xnis statement was raaue uy uxrs.Samuel Wilson, of Lexington, Statechairman for the Democratic womenof Kentucky, appointed by StateChairman John L.

Mr. UlrichBell, Commander of Kentucky, latelygave this paper the following viewpoint which should be read by everyex-soldier, parent and thinking citiben: Mere clannishness for the sake ofyarn-swapping on left over memoriesof the war-time simple contact withone's own ilk would never haveserved as a sufficient basis for the existence of the American Legion. Onlydeep-laid principles, those set outbelow by the far-sighted founders ofthe Legion, could have sufficed for anorganization which aspired to the placethe Legion now occupies."To foster and perpetuate a onehundred per cent Americanism" and"to inculcate a sense of individual obl'jration to the community, state andnation."ULRICH BELL,State Commander of American Legion.Under these two great ambitions, theAmerican Legion interprets educationas its great field of endeavor for thefuture. Working with all other agencies in meeting the ramifying needs ofthis field, tl-e Department of Kentuckyhope5? for even a modest part in thrusting forward every project that looks tothe- safeguarding of the high and true.standards by which the schools of theState should be guided in preparingupcoming generation: for good citizenship. Under the new state laws which allow the citizens to elect from the county at large the hest possible CountyBoard of Education, chosen withoutreference to politics, the American Legion sees the best immediate opportunity for placing the school childrenunder qualified supervisors and teachers. Those who would bring partisanpolitics to bear in educational matters must come sharply into conflictwith the outstanding principles of theLtgion.Under an Americanization plan, :obe launched in September by the Legion, with a State Commission, it ishoped to bring to bear all influenceson the problem in this State ; but, mostparticularly, by means of education.In the appeal now being made forthoughtful selection of County SchoolBoards, the Legion sees a work inwhich it can ask the 85,000 Kentuckyex:-,ervice men and the public as owhole to join heartily.SCHOOL SITUATION IN STATEOBJECTS OF LEGION"For God and Country we associate ourselves together for the following purposes:"To uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States ofAmerica; to maintain law and order; to foster and perpetuate aone hundred per cent Americanism ;to preserve the memories and incidents of our association in theGreat War; to inculcate a sense ofindividual obligation to the community, state and nation ; to combat the autocracy of both theclasses and the masses ; to makeright the master of might; to promote peace and good will on earth ;to safeguard and transmit to posterity the principles of justice, freedom and democracy; to consecrateand sanctify our comradeship byour devotion to mutual helpfulness."The following news story whichcame from Washington about August1st is given to set the reader to thinking about the school situation in Kentucky. The story is followed by an interview which our correspondent hadwith Honorable George. Colvin, StateSuperintendent of Public Instruction,so our readers might have the wholetruth in the matter.Forty-one and one-tenth per cent ofthe average school term in Kentuckyis wasted because of irregular attendance, according to figures compiledand announced by the Bureau of Education today. The percentage of wasterhrough irregular attendance is greaterin Kentucky than in any other State,officials of the Federal Bureau say.Indiana, on the other hand, wastesonly 7 per cent of its average schoolterm through irregular attendance, andsfinds first in' the list of States onschool attendance records, while Kentucky stands at the bottom.The amount of school terms wastedby irregular attendance on an averagefor all the States is 25.4 per cent, orjust about half way between the figures given on Indiana and on Kentucky. Educational officials here pointout that the school term in Kentucky,on the average, represents only 150days if the allowance were 100 percent, but the actual school term is reduced because of poor attendance toabout eighty-eight days. It K estimated that this irregular attendancewastage of school term results in afinancial loss of approximately, $3,300,000. Kentucky's new school attendancelaw, passed by the last Legislature,is designated by officials of the Federal Bureau of Education as one of thmost far-reaching and important piecesof legislation ever passed for the benefit of Kentucky's educational system.The Honorable Geo. Colvin had thefollowing to say concerning the abovenews item:"I might suggest that statistics withus are so unreliable as to make anyconclusion of this sort wholly a matterof conjecture. We are not attemptingto extenuate our condition, nor tomake excuses for it. We know thatit is deplorably bad. We are trying toface thevsituation honestly and fearlessly. We are exerting every effortto improve the efficiency of ourschools, to increase the attendance,and to develop a public sentimenr thatwill demand and support measureslooking to these ends."We are greatly encouraged by thedetermination and desire everywhereexpressed to improve our educationalconditions. We seem to have the needed legislation, thanks to the courageand wisdom of our last General Assembly. Our present obligation is to putthee new laws into effect. The situation does not call for despondency ordespair, but confidence.""I have actually gained over fifteen pounds on three bottles of Tanlac, and I consider it the best investment I ever made in my life," saidJames C. Cook, 316 Philips Avenue,Toledo, Ohio, an employe of theOverland Automobile Company."A year ago this winter," saidMr. Cook, " I was taken down witha veiy bad case of the 'flu,' and forsome time afterwards was in amighty bad fix. I was in such poorhealth this winter that it worriedme. I could eat nothing but whatit jmade me feel miserable. Therewas a feeling like a lump of lead andawful pains in the pit of my stomach that often lasted for days at atime. I was al&o bilious, my complexion was yellow, and unhealthylooking. About two months ago Ihad such a bad spell with my stomach that I had to lay off from workfor several days, and live on suchthings as toast and milk, and eventhen I felt weak and dizzy and hadfainling spells every day. I becamegreatly discouraged as it looked asif my case was beyond the reach ofmedicines."One day I read a statement thatdescribed my troubles so well thatI immediately bought a bottle toTanlac. That first bottle -helped meso much that I followed it up, andthe results have been nothing lessthan wonderful. I have taken threebottles now and have actually gained more than fifteen pounds inweight; I can eat anything set before me and the fact that I havepicked up so rapidly in weight showshow well my food agrees with jmeI sleep sound every night and feelas well in every way as I did before having the 'flu.'

Itis the general opinion that unlessseveral days of warm sunshine arehad this week the tobacco will bebadly damaged and that the cornand other crops will also rot.Tobacco growers are very muchdiscouraged over the present conditions. Tobacco cutting is on withfull speed, and the crops are rapidlybeing placed under shelter. It isestimated by conservative men thatfully one-fourth of the crop in thiscounty is affected by "rust" and"wildfire," and will hardly be worthstripping and housing. Farmersare paying from ?4 to $6 per dayfor extra men to house the crop. Oneman, named John Johnson, made$18 one day last week cutting tobacco. There will be a fine crop inthe county, despite the present adverse conditions.The abundant rains have beenvery beneficial to the grass, therebeing an excellent prospect for fallgrazing, together with a very propnising hay crop, which insures plentyof feed for the fall and part of thewinter. The best corn crop grownin the county in many years is maturing, which will largely make upthe deficiency caused by the damaged tobacco crops. Fall plowing hascommenced, as the season for seeding wheat and rye is at hand. 'Alarge acreage of wheat and rye willbe sowed this fall. The potato croppromises well. The second cropseed is up nicely, and, with a favorable season of sunshine, will makea good yield.Country produce is coming inabundantly and the prices are veryreasonable. The :ains have freshened up the gardens. All kinds oflivestock is doing well. Hogs analambs continue steady. About fivehundred heavy cattle were shippedout during the week, going principally to the Eastern markets.REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS-.Mitchell, Moreland & Mitchell,real estate agents, sold Saturday toJ.
