for the Juniors in the dining oom and
after most of the guests had taken
their places, the Juniors filed into the
places assigned them, each member
accompanied by a lady. After re
freshments various amusements were
indulged in, the most amusing of
which was the police court. This
proved very interesting, with Mr. O.
E. Hurst as police judge and Mr. W.
V. Shaw as policeman. Various
guests were arrested uy Mr. Shaw and
taken before "Judge" Hurst, Mr.
Shaw charging them with something
and "Judge"Hurst imposing the pen

Our community was somewhat
surprised early Monday morning
when it was learned that Mr. Andrew
Jackson Thaxton had gone to Rock
land, New York, to be married to
Miss Grace Mingus. This young
couple had been sweethearts nearly
two years and while it was generally
known by their intimate friends that
their marriage woulc take place soon,
no one realized that their courtship
would reach its climax this week.
Mr. Thaxton has kpt this a secret
and it is not now even known the
exact date of the wedding. The only
thing that he has given out to a few
of his most intimate friends is that
it will take place this week. Mr.
Thaxton is one of our prominent and
prosperous young farmers. He is
