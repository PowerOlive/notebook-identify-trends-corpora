PARIS STUDENTS HONORED
AT CENTRAL .UNIVERSITY.
When a gentle rain began falling
early Saturday mornig there was a
general feeling of relief among the cit
izens of Paris that the long dry spell
which has prevailed, would be brok
en, and that the water famine which
this city is facing would be relieved.
However, the rainfall was only of
short duration, and a decided drop in
the mercury brought an end to the
precipitation, causing no end of dis
appointment. Clear skies and a
continuation of cool weather are any
thing but encouraging, ad the outlook
is becoming more serious every day.
The Paris Water Company, under
the present system of pumping, is
making the best of the situation, and
the consumers are only supplied with
water at certain hours of the day.
According to Superintendent Mitchell
the supply of water in Stoner Creek
can be retained for some time under
the present system.
As a protection against fire the
company has retained in the stand
pipe upwards of 300,000 gallons of
water, and the consumers throughout
the city are being supplied by direct
pressure.
Employes of the Louisville & Nash
ville railway have been engaged in
trenching the creek above the dam
to allow the water to flow from the
pools that are standing in front of
Foote's landing and several others
this side of the railroad bridge, to
the basin above the dam within reach
of the pipes leading to the railroad
pumping station. At the same time,
however, a constant stream is being
drawn from Doyle's spring.
A large number of wells and cis
terns throughout the city -are dry,
and many are compelled to carry wa
ter for great distance to supply the
household.
LARGE CLASS CONFIRMED
AT PARIS CATHOLIC CHURCH
FIRM DISPUTES ACCOUNT
AND CHARITY GETS BENEFIT
Mr. G. C. Thompson, son of Sheriff
and Mrs. Albert S. Thompson, was
honored at a meeting of the freshman
class of Central University, Septem
ber 28, by being elected president of
his class. The college paper speaks
very highly of Mr. Thompson. The
senior class of 1913 elected Mr. Sid
ney S. Ardery, of Paris, president for
the coming year.

A difference of opinion which prob
ably would have resulted in a suit
found an amicable adjustment a few
days ago when it was decided by the
parties interested to give the amount
involved to charity.
Strauther & Booth, merchants of
near Osgood, had been running an
account with the firm of Curry, Tunis
& Norwood, wholesale grocers of Lex
ington. In a settlement of the ac
count the former firm entered a de
nial of a charge amounting to $5.90.
The wholesale grocery firm was
equally as strong in the opinion that
! the account was just. However their
debtors refused payment.
To settle the affair without litiga
tion and at the same time save a lot
of expense a member of the mercan
tile firm made a proposition that the
amount claimed be turned over to the
Widows' and Orphans' Home, to which
i the Lexington firm agreed.
A class of forty-three boys and
girls was confirmed Sunday morning
at the Catholic church by Bishop C. P.
Maes, of Covington.
There were also six first communi
cants at first mass Sunday morning
at 7 o'clock, the members of the con
firmation class having taken their
first communion last January, and
have been receiving instruction since
that time from the local pastor, Rev.
Father Eugene DeBruyn, and the Sis
ters who have charge of the parochial
school. The following girls and boys
formed the class:
. Helen Edwards, Helen Shanding,
Josephine Adams, Mary Catherine
Connelley, Mary Joseph, Mary Mark

Father DeBruyn motored to Cynthi
ana, to confirm a class there Sunday
afternoon.
CHEAP CIGARETTES
Of America" Manufacture Are. In
Greater Demand in Bombay.
A report on the foreign commerce
of Bombay made to the United States
Department of Commerce and Labor
by Consul Edward J. Norton, station
en in Bombay, India, states that the
imports of manufactured tobacco, de
spite an increase in quantity, have
not been maintained at the level of
the previous year, and a decrease is
also observed in the arrival of cigars.
Cigarettes, which form the largest
item in this group, have not main
tained the recovery which they ex
hibited in 1911-1912. The decline is
most marked in imports of cigarettes
form the United Kingdom, which de
creased in quantity by 20,909 pounds.
Egytian cigarettes, which return the
highest avarage value per pound,
have increased and are well above
the average of imports in the two
years immediately preceding the en
hancement of the duty, and a recov-
j ery, though small, is also noticed in
the imports of cheap American cigar
ettes, which were returned at 2,210
pounds of an average value per pound
of 26 cents.

"BOUGHT AND PAID FOR"
GUARANTEED BY BRADY.
William A. Brady's production of
George 3ro&dburst's remarkable play
'Bought and Pn.it! For," will be seen
at the Grand Opera House, on next
Wednesday night, Oct. 15. Clergy-,
men, and lecturers and numerous
branches of the Dramatic League of
America have endorsed it because of
its .moral lesson, technical construc
tion and nice balance, while the gen
eral public h&ye made possible one of
the most successful dramatic runs in
theatrical history because they like
the play, which is a chapter from real
life. The present members of the
cast have played over five hundred
times in the production.
It would be well for the large pro
ducing managers who send out their
attractions and then forget about
them, except for the financial reve
nue derived, if they followed Mr.
Brady's example in keeping close
watch upon each of the traveling
productions under his management.
Taking the public into his confi
dence, Mr. Brady sends out a person
al guarantee with "Bought and Paid
For," a copy of which reads as fol

SPECIAL TO THE PUBLIC
This production of "BOUGHT AND
PAID FOR," the biggest play of our
time, carries my percona! guarantee. It
is the same in every particular as drew
packed houses for two years at my
Playhouse in New Yor!:-
If you find anything to criticise any
slurring or inattention by the players,
or any point about the stage equipment
that does not justify the highest claims
of the management I shall esteem it a
very great favor to have you write me
in detail at my offices in the Playhouse.
New York.
It has been asserted in some quarters
that lack of interest in amusements in all
but the few largest cities has been caused
by short sighted managers who. sent
inferior companies and shabby scenery
to these centres. I am determined that
my name, when attached to an attraction,
shall be a full assurance of the high,
value of that attraction, and I bespeak
your assistance to that end.
Any proper complaint you may make,
will receive, prompt .and YespectfuL
attention.

FADE FROM SIGHT.
Lights Used by Wizard to Make Per
sons Disappear. .
Tucked away in a corner of the new
scientific research laboratory of an
electric lamp company's plant at
East Cleveland, a man whom scien
tists know as the "Lighting Wizard"
is performing wonders by applying
scientifically the principles of light
and color. He is M. Luckiesh.
"Magic come back to earth," peo
ple exclaim when they see the mar
vels he performs. Luckiesh, by deft
manipulation of many colored tubes,
can cause his assistant, standing on
the stage of his laboratory, to disap
pear from sight.
"I can throw rays of light on. a
man which do not contain any of the
colors in which he is clothed," Luck
iesh explains. "Naturally, then, we
won't see him, because all the light
that strikes him will be absorbed and
none will be thrown back to our
eyes. He will disappear completely."

OVER ONE HUNDRED LIVES
LOST WHEN STEAMER BURNS.
Futilely fighting against twin de
stroyers of the merciless elements,
the officers and crew of the Uranium
Line steamer Voltcrno struck their
colors early Friday morning, and
leaped from the blistering deck of
a floating inferno into the yeasty foam
of a tempest-tossed ocean.
Iron-hearted steel-anus'cled mari
ners from ten ships, called by frantic
"S. O. S." wireless appeals, reached
over the gunwales of oak-ribbed life
boats to drag them from the very
jaws of death.
They already had performed the
same service for nearly half a thous
and frightened passengers, who, de
spairing of rescue while the hurricane
raged, leaped into the ocean when
boats were unable to reach the side
of the doomed vessel.
One hundred and thirty-six lives
are known to have been lost as a re
sult of the disaster.
JEALOUSY CAUSES A CUTTING
SCRAPE IN 3RENTSV1LLE
J an altercation near the negro set
tlement of Brentsville Saturday ight
Horace Redmon, a colored boy about
sixteen years of age , was stabbed
several times in the back by Ben
Stout. The trouble is alleged to
have started over the attentions Red
mon was paying to a colored girl with
whom Stout was infatuated, and it is
alleged that Stout concealed himself
in a clump of bushes later in the night
and when Redmo passed he attacked
hi,m. A number of wounds were in
flicted in the negro's back, He was
brought to this city, where his inju-
Jries were dressed.
Plans are being considered .for in
stalling a 200,000,000 candle power
seachelight on top of the world's tall
est building in New York.
