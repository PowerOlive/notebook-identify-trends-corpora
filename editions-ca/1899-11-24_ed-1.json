to Doctors
We have the highest regard for the
nedical profession Our preparations
re not sold for the purpose of antagon
izing them but rather as an aid We
lay it down as an established truth that
internal remedies are positively injuri
ous to expectant mothers The distress
and discomforts experienced during the
months preceding childbirth can be al
leviated only by external treatment by
applying a liniment that softens and re
Saxes the over strained muscles We
make and sell such a liniment com
bining the ingredients in a manner
kitherto unknown and call it
Mothers Friend
We know that in thousands of cases
ft has proved more than a blessing to
expectant mothers It overcomes morn
ing sickness It relieves the sense of
tightness Headaches cease and dan
ger from Swollen Hard and Rising
Breasts is avoided Labor itself is
shortened and shorn of most of the pain
We know that many doctors recom
mend it and we know that multitudes
f women go to the drug stores and buy
it because they are sure their physicians
Iiave no objections We ask a trial
just a fair test There is no possible
chance of injury being the result be
cause Mothers Friend is scientific
ally compounded It is sold at i a bot
tle and should be used during most of
the period of gestation although great
relief is experienced if used only a short
time before childbirth Send for our il

iPimples Turn
to Cancer
Cancer often results from an im
purity in the blood inherited from
fenerations back Few people are en
tirely free from some taint in the blood
and it is impossible to tell when it will
break out in the form of dreaded Can
cer What has appeared to be a mere
pimple or scratch has developed into
the most malignant Cancer
I had a severe Cancer which was at first
mils a fw Hotches that I thought would
uuu pass away i w
treated hy several able
physicians but in spite
of their efforts the Can
cer spread until my con
ditiou became alarming
After many months ol
treatment and growing
steadily worse I de
cided to try S 8 8
which was so strongly
recommended The first
bottle produced an im
provement I continued
the medicine and In
four months the last lit
tle scab dropped off
Ten years have elapsed
not a sign of the disease has returned

The Restaurant Glass
Give me a glass of water please
The request was made to a waiter
behind the marble top lunch counter
of a well known restaurant in the cen
tral part of the city
All right sir was the waiters re
ply I will just as soon as you pur
your glass down
The man looked first at the empty
glass he held in his hand and then at
the waiter Then his choler began to
rise at what he considered an unwar
ranted piece of impertinence The
waiter evidently saw the outbrust of
wrath that was coming
No offense meant sir he hastily
explained You see its just this
way The first thing a waiter learns
and he learns it by dearly bought ex
perience too is never to take a glass
from another persons hand Why
Because if he does the chances are
about even that the glass will fall and
be smashed in the transfer This Is
particularly true if the top of the ta
ble or counter happens to be f mar
ble as this one Is You probably un
derstand that when a waiter breaks
anything in a hotel or restaurant he
has to pay for it and you probably
now understand why It was that I
would fill your glass as soon as you put
it down so that I could pick it up my

If you want the matter demonstrat

do not ask the judgment of the palate
They ask the judgment of the eye
They ask you to criticise Swiss chalets

There is a feelingr of

nervousness or hysteria may make life

The preservation of the healthful tone
of the body depends chiefly on keep

symptoms appear the timely use of
