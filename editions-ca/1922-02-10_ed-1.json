secretary. He was the roughest of roughnecks and got "the
job by strongarm tactics. The other applicants bounced out
like rubber balls. And then things happened swiftly to-
Doris May, Nas Margie Carr, a sweet young thing;
Hallem Cooley, as Homer Dean Chad wick, her fiance;
Ofts Harlan, as "Old Top" Carr, her indulgent father;
Arthur Hoyt, as Lester Hicks, somewhat of a nut;
Lillian Worth as Flossie, a dizzy vamp;
Bull Montana, as Bubbs, a rowdy seeking culture;
Billy Elmer,vas Cauliflower Jim, as tough as he looks;

"Where Lights Are Low"
A An R-C Picture, directed by Colin Campbell, Presents a
drama of love and peril and swiftly moving action that brings
a sob to the throat and a cheer to the lips. It is LOVE that
rules this Chinese prince through suffering and sacrifice. It
is LOVE that steels his arm to strike the foes who threaten
the woman's happiness. It is LOVE that strengthens him to
meet his enemies and to fight the most deadly combat ever
seen upon the screen. The outcome of that epic struggle?
You cannot guess until the final fadeout, and then your nerves
and you sigh with relief and satisfaction.
