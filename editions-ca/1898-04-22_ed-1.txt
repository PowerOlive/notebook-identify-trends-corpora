LimitedWashington April 21 I hopesaid a prominent naval officer Wednesday who has given much thought tcthe subject that the plan of operations decided upon by the departmentwill not include an attack by our fleeon Morro Castle and the forts at Cabanas as the first stioke of the campaign If we do this many of ouiships are sure to be crippled and senthome for repairs Our docking facilities on the South Atlantic coast areso limited that the vessels wouldeither have to be- sent far north tobe repaired or else await their timefor docking in the south TheSpaniards are taking the cue and aredisplaying much military sagacity inthe movement of their ships They areconcentrating them in their homeports and if our fleets are disabled byattempting to reduce the fortificationsat Havana they will steam over hereand inflict irreparable damage uponthem It seems to me the proper thingfor us to do would be to attempt to landa large force of men in Cuba surroundthe fortifications and starveout the Spaniards meanwhile keepingup a blockade of the harbor andthe coast by our fleet of ships I thinkwith an army of 20000 men supplemented bv the insurgents strength onthe island we would be able to do thisYou will remember that during thelate war our fleets suffered considerably in the attack on the forts inCharleston harbor whereas when thesoldiers holding them ascertained thatSherman was coming with an armyfrom the inland they began to evacuatewhen he was 100 miles away Thesematters have been brought to the attention of the strategic board which isnow formulating a plan of

Persons inBelligerent and Xeutrnl NationsSome Points in LawThe effect of a state of war upon therights of persons whether native oralien and upon contracts property andtrade is a matter of greatest interest atthis time The leading authoritiestipon this subject are Henry WheatonTheodore D Woosley and FrancisWharton and from the works of thesemasters of international law the following information is extractedDuring a state of war neither belligerent has Jic right to Mie in the courtsof the other to enforce a contract orcollect a debt The citizens of t he parties of course come under the sameprohibitions Contracts made with anenenvy during a state of war cannot beenforced in the courts of either nationafter war is concludedThe general rule as to treaties is thatthey are abrogated by war But certain treaties are exempted from thisrule Privateering treaties are an example of such exemptions and it isworth while to note here that the UnitedStates nor Spain is a signatory to thedeclaration of Paris in 1S36The parties to this declaration whichincludes all the principal powers of Europe agreed to abolish privateeringbut the United States declined to signunless the condition was made that theprivate property not contraband ofall nations at all times be secure fromseizure on the high seas This government took the ground that as long assuch exemption was not made the nation with a small navy would be at agreat disadvantageAn enemys property after war is declared may be seized wherever foundexcept when it is located in the territory of neutrals It is not customaryhowever in modern times to seize theproperty of noncombatants who aresubjects of the enemy temporarily domiciled To confiscate stocks bonds orthe real estate of a noncombatant wouldbe sure to call forth reprisals and wouldthus react upon the belligerent whotook the first step in this directionGenerally a certain period is fixedwithin which citizens of a belligerentleave the territory of its opponent afterwar has been declared and in case theyleave the country within this specifiedtime then property is safe from confiscation during their passage to theirown or some other countryStrictly speaking belligerents havethe right just as soon as war is declaredto seize each others ships and cargoesin their respective ports as droits ofadmiralty but here again modernpractices have established the customof giving notice of the time in whichshipping must be removed This timewas fixed at 40 days at the time of theCrimean war The ship of one belligerent if it sails before war is declaredfor one of the ports of the other belligerent is safe from seizure If however a ship sails to a neutral port she isIiableJ07seizure During hostilities allinhabitant native and alien are com-pelled to discontinue all intercoursewith the inhabitants of the country atwar with the one in which they liveThe property of the citizens of eitherbelligerent who live in the country olthe other belligerent is looked upon asa part of the property of their adopteMland and b ing regarded as such is liable to the reprisals authorized by theirnative country Such property as thisclass of persons may have in the tradeof their adopted country may be seizedby their native country until such timeas they declare their national character In this case a declaration ofintention is not enough since meredeclarations might be

flightThen by its side He gently laidThose untried thingsThat we in human parlance callA pair of wingsAnd said My little one this loadUplift and seeBeneath this strange disguise my lovesSweet thought for theeThe feathered darling serious grewA sudden sobChoked all the music in its throatAmi seemed to robThe air of sunshine yet it gaveA patient nodAnd said Ill bear it for your sakeDear Father GodThen on reluctant shoulders firmThe burden laidAnd lo the merry winds of heavenAbout it playedUntil in very ecstasyIt spurned the groundAnd borne upon its lifted loadGlad freedom foundO mortal shrinking from thy crossBehold the birdsAnd learn the dearest meaning yetOf those sweet wordsElla Gilbert Ives in N Y IndependentHIS AMERICAN BEAUTYBy JOHN S ROGERSeopurigktl98first met her at the

by Frank EStockton on The Buccaneers of OurCoast is one of the features of StNicholas Mr Stockton ttlls of the adventures of Bartholemy Portuguezwho with a small crow in a small vessel captured a huge Spanish merchantman in the Caribbean sea Mr Stocktonsays The little pirate sailed boldly toward the big Spaniard and the lattervessel utterly astonished at the audacity of this attack frr the pirates flagwas flying lay to head to the windand waited the gunners standing bytheir cannon When the pirates hadcome near enough to see and understandthe size and power of the vessel theyhad thought of attacking they did notas might have been expected put aboutand sail away at the best of their vessels speed but they kept straight ontheir course as if they were about tofall upon a great unwieldy merchantman manned by common sailorsPerceiving the foolhardiness of thelittle vessel the Spanish commanderdetermined to give it a lesson whichwould teach its captain to understandbetter the relative power of great vessels and little ones so as soon as thepirates vessel was near enough he ordered a broadside fired upon it TheSpanish ship had a great many peoplej on board It had a crew of 70 men andVlQCirloa fllOCO i lCYrk TlTOrO CnrtlA rnrrrnuuiuuo iiivcu uijiv yyiu ovjxjjo Uacaciigers and regular marines and knowing that the captain had determined tofire upon the approaching vessel everybody had gathbicd on deck to seo tbelittle pirate ship go downBut the ten great cannon balls whichwere shot out at Eartholemys littlecraft all mised their im and before theguns could be reloaded or the great shipbe got around so as to deliver her otherbroadside the pi a re vessel was alongside of her Eartholemy had fired noneof his cannou Such guns were uselessagainst so huge a foe What he was after was a hand to hand combat on thedeck of the Spanish shipThe pirates were all ready for hotwork They had thrown aside theircoats and shirts as if each of them weregoing into a prizefight and with theircutlasses in their hands and theirtols and knives in their belts theyscrrrabled like monkeys up the sides ofthe great ship But Spaniards are bravemen and good fighters there were morethan twice as many of them as therewere of the pirates and it was notlong before the latter found out thatthey could not capture that vessel byboarding it So over the side they tumbled as fast as they could go leavingsome of their number dead and woundedbehind them They jumped into theirown vessel and then they putGashort distance to take breath and getready for a different kind of fightf Tlietriumphant Spaniards now prepared toget rid of this boatload of half nakedwild beasts which they could easily doif they took better aim with their cannon than they had done beforeBut to their amazement they soonfound that they could do nothing withthe guns nor were they able to worktheir ship so as to get it into positionfor effectual shots Bartholemy and hismen laid aside their cutlasses and theirpistols and took up muskets with whichthey were well provided Their vessellay within very short range of the Spanish ship and whenever a man coulcl beseen through the portholes or showedhimself in the rigging or anywhere elsewhere it was necessary to go in orderto work the ship he made himself a target for the good aim of the pirates Thepirate vessel could move about as itpleased for it required but a few mento manage it and so it kept out ofthe way of the Spanish guns and itsbest marksmen crouching close to thedeck fired and fired whenever a Spanish head was to be seenFor five long hours this unequal contest was kept up It might have reminded one of a man with a slender rodand a long delicate line who hadhooked a big salmon The man couldnot pull in the salmon but on the otherhand the salmon could not hurt theman and in the course of time the bigfish would be tired out and the manwould get out his landing net and scoophim inNow Bartholemy thought he couldscoop in the Spanish vessel So manyof her men had been shot that the twocrews would be more nearly equal Sohe boldly ran his vessel alongside thebig ship and again boarded her Thenthere was another great fight on thedecks The Spaniards had ceased to betriumphant but they had become desperate and in the furious combat tenof the pirates were killed and fourwounded- But the Spaniards faredworse than that More than half of themen who had not been shot by the pirates went down before their cutlassesand pistols and it was not long beforeBartholemy had captured the greatSpanish shipIt was a fearful and a oostly victoryhe had gained A great part of his ownmen were lying dead or helpless on thedeck and of the Spaniards only 40 wereleft alive and these it appears fromthe accounts must have been nearly allwounded or disabledDont Imj ItI have no place to lay my headehe sobbedHer good fairy at once appearedBe careful then urged the latterwaving her wand that you dont loseitGliding to
