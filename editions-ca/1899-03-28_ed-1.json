is a cure It goes down to the very seat of all blood diseases and pets at the

Obedience of Orders
A naval commander in the reign of
Queen Anne was ordered to cruise with
a squadron within certain limits on the
coast of Spain Having received infor
mation that a Spanish fleet was in Vigo
beyond his limits he resolved to risk
his personal responsibility for the good
of his country He accordingly attacked
and defeated the Spanish fleet with un
common gallantry When he joined the
admiral under whom he served he was
ordered under arrest and was asked
if he did not know that by the arti
cles of war he was liable to be shot for
disobedience of orders
He replied with great composure
that he was very sensible that he was
but added The man who is afraid to
risk his life in any way when the good
of his country requires it is uuwoijthy
of a command in hor majestys service
