It was a mingling of the greatheart and purpose of Kentucky Demorcracy, dedicated to service. " Itwas the formation in battle array ofa host defeated, but triumphant inspirit. It was the beginning of amarch to victory.More than this, it was the end of !faciionalism among Kentucky Democrats, j-iiere were no isecKnaraDemocrats or Stanley Democratsthere. There were no "wet" Democrats or "dry" Democrats there.Ihey were all just plain Democrats, Jwithout any useless appendage.They were fired by zeal for party.enn.ce ana for state service. AsJudge Hardin said, men were placedto the forefront in partyv affairs forwhat they expected to put into it,and not what they expected to getout of it. 'The Democratic party has neverlost a fight in the State when it isunited, and it 4fas never been moreunited than it is to-day. Defeat3 -as roused it from its lethargy. Detemination is in every Democrat'shoul. There are no more partyknockers. They are all turned toboosters."United we stand, divided wefall" is not only Kentucky's motto,it is Kentucky Democracy's lesson."Divided, the party has fallen;, united, as it is to-day, it will' stand andsucceed.o-MAYOR PROTESTS PARISTER SERVICE.WA-Several days ago Mayor E.

Duringweeks last year there was a shortage of ice, due to the fact that themill dam across S toner Creek hadgiven way, as a result of the corroding touch of time and let the waterbasin above the dam lose its supply. An one period of the summerbut a small quantity of ice could brsecuied at Cincinnati and otherplants which retailed at a cent apound, resulting in much sufferingthroughout the city.The old dam was replaced lastfall by a new concrete structure onefoot higher than the old one, andthe supply of water is now ten feetdeeper above the dam than it was ayear ago. A stage of practically 20feet, -can be maintained throughoutthe year. In anticipation of this theParis Ice Manufacturing Company,is practically making a new plantout of the business, at the foot ofJvlaysville, street. A force of expertmechanics are remodeling thestructure arid correcting every possible defect that can 'be found andthe freezing of ice will begin April25. Pumps and boilers are beingoverhauled, pipe connections madeover and the entire plant put in firstclass condition.K The new rapacity will be 45 tonsa day, which will take care of theWants of Paris and Bourbon countytrade and leave a margin for carload shipments to near by points.The improvements to the plant willcost several thousand dollars. Theweekly payroll is now $160, whichwill be more than doubled when operations begin. (It)oKENTUCKY TUREMEN RETURN.. vDan T.

The entire burley salesincluding those for dealers and theresales, the two later of course entering into the speculative feature ofthe market, netted $36.11 per 100pounds. It is therefore evident thatthe speculator has averaged higherprices than the grower.The following tabulated statisticsthrow considerable light on the actual trend of market prices Kn Kentucky during the time the bulk of the1920 and 1918 crops were marketed,but whatever fluctuations are shownfrom month to month, it must beconsidered that after all it is the average for the entire season whichproves whether or not a crop hasmade money for its producer.1919 1918BurleyFebruary $28.41January 37.16December 47.09November 27.17October 23.30$35.6134.2028.1124.5929.42September 27.46One SuckerFebruary 13.19January , 15.86December 15,55NovemberOctoberUnfired Dark14.8614.5914.4011.8415.0015.4215.1714.7921.1121.8118.6015.4512.9014.8016.5414.8614.9831.6828.9220.7423.3128.4017.66February 12.67January 15.70December 16.49OctoberFired DarkFebruary 17.74January 21.47December J 20.23OctoberSeptemberGreen RiverFebruary 12.97January "j 16.46December t 18.25Total 1February 26.14January 32.03December 35.64NovemberOctoberSeptemberWASHINGTON.

Thiswas in 1918, when Kenneth Alexander's Escobia was thought to havethe edge on the representatives fior.ithe East, but changed' track conditions at the eleventh hour enabledW. S. Kilmer's Exterminator tobeat him out.This year the West will probably pin its hopes on Edward F.Simms' recently acquired Prince Palwhich showed in his 2-year-old-formthat he is a genuine stayer.The son of Prince Palatine did notshow a great deal of class lastyear, but shrewd horsemen predicted that he had every qualification for a great 3 -year-old and thUprediction has been partially fulfilled in that he has grown into ahhandsome a looking piece of horseflesh as has been seen in theseparts in some time.

You can figure it out for yourselfby comparison.For instance, examine some well-known-'wagon that sells for practically the same priceas the Weber and note carefully the ironing ofthe gears and the distinctive features ifthey have any. ,Now come over and see us and let us show you the Weber. Compare thiswagon, point for point, and size of each piece of wood stock, with the other fellow'sproduct. Note the ironing of the Weber gears and bear in mind how cheapthe other fellow's wagon gears looked in comparison. Note the Weber swivel-reach-couplingthat takes all twisting strain off the gears and brakes and don'tforget that this feature was entirely lacking on the other fellow's -wagon. Notethe Weber Fifth-Wheel that distributes the strain on the front bolster, preventsit from rocking and' reduces to a minimum whipping of the tongue, etc. anddon't forget that this feature, too, was altogether lacking pn the other fellow'swagon.A difference of $1 1.50 to $18.00 in favor of the Weber is apparent nearlyalways. fNow then answer to your own satisfaction the question of whether theprice of the Weber with stricdy A-grade wheels with high carbon tire, is' too low orthe prices of other wagons too high, considering quality. - And remember wesell Weber Auto -Track Wagons the "King of all Farm Wagons."THE C.

Gradually growing in brilliancy theyrose to the zenith about eighto'clock, and in intermittent flashesof lightning-like intensity, wovethe whole into a scene of greatsplendor. -Shafts of many hues emanated from the -northwest andliotheast, converged to a vcoramonpoint at the zenith and terminatedin a whirl of colored light, resembling a rose in full bloom. A band oflight played deep in the northernhorizon and was the last of thewonderful display to disappear.Many who were not posted on theappearance of the spectacle unwittingly ascribed the phenomena tothe fact that hundreds of tobaccobeds were being burned all overthe country, and the reflection inthe skies of the fires beneath made !the big show.
