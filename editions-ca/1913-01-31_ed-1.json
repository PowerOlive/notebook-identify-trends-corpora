- Aphorisms of Lady Grant.

a waist! Women find a man dull and
uninteresting when lie proposes to
another woman. "The Chequer

Doing Good.
We are to relieve the distressed,
put the wanderer into his way, and
to divide our bread with, the hungry,
which is but the way of doing good
to ourselves; for we are only several
members of one great body. Seneca.
"RabyNMine" Pleases Big
Audience.
''Baby Mine" with Walter Jones in
h;s original role ot Jiminv Jincks, was
the attraction at the Grand Opera
House Wednesday evening, and the
performance,- the best of the season,
was witnessed by one of the largest
audiences in the history of the present
management.
Theplay is one of unusual merit,
funny to the extreme, and givea the
clever Jones and his excellent support
a vehicle in which the individuality of
each member of the cast can feadily
be distinguished.
Miss Marjbrie Cuurtland, as Zoie,
Alfred Hard's wife, carried through'
out a clever line of comedy, which
though spicy in spots had enough of
the snap and mirth producing qualities
to satisfy the audience beyond meas
ure. Mr. Jones as Jimmy Jincks, who
through the medium of his wife, a
comrade and neighbor of Zoie, was
worked into many trying and amusing
situations, and was mired in complica
tions until the final act when the own
ership of the babies was settled to the
satisfaction of all.
The play was one or the kind that
Paris gtheatregoers admire, and Lwho
are free in their patronage wheri a
meritorious'offering is presented.
It is to be hoped the boards of the
Grand will.be gracedwith productions
equal, or even better, during the re
mainder of the season.

Relic of Spanish Armada.
An anchor of the Spanish armada
period, recovered from the Wallett, a
well-known "swatchway," three miles
off Clacton, England, has been pre
sented to Colchester (Essex) Museum.
For generations this anchor has been
an enemy to the trawls of local fisher
men, but at length one of the flukes
became worn partially away, and
the last trawl that struck it thus lift
ed it from the ground.
