inGeneral The Board of Inquiry Report Will Be Made Public MondayWashington- March 23 The -cabinetmeeting Tuesday lasted something overan hour and was devoted exclusively0 the Spanish situation in generaland to the forthcoming- report of thecourt of inquiry in particular Thetone of the discussion -was very firmand determined that there must comean end to the present state of affairsin Cuba Secretary Long authorizedthe statement that the understanding before the cabinet was that thereport would reach Washington onnext Thursday or Friday that it wasvery voluminous and that its publication and transmission to congresswould not occur until Monday or Tuesday as the president would requirethat much time to give the documentthe mature consideration that momentous character required Other cabinet officers stated that general planincluded the sending of apresidential message along withthe report stating that Spainhad been called upon to makesuitable response to the case presentedby the court of inquiry While thecabinet associates of the presidentmaintained their usual reserve as tothe exact character of their deliberations yet it was conceded that he discussion proceeded on the theory thatthe coming report would showthat the Maine explosion was not theresult of an accident but was dueto an external cause There isno doubt that substantial unanimityexists on the part of the president andall his cabinet both as to the Mainequestion and the general subject ofCubaThe possibility of a recourse to intervention in case Spain declined tomake suitable response to the representations we will make after receiving the Maine report has been fullydiscussed although necessarilly ithas been an abstract discussionthus far and no conclusion has beenreached nor is it possible until thevital question as to the cdurts findingsis before the president and cabinetAt the same time there is a very evident intention to consider all eventualities including the recourse to intervention the recognition of independence and other methods which appearto eventually meet the requirementsof such a conditionKey West Fla March 23 TheUnited States court of inquiry into theloss of the battleship Maine has at lastfinished its laborious work of investigating the disaster and has submittedits report to Rr Adm Sicard He haspointed out some alterations which heconsiders necessary and the reportmay be taken to Washington by LieutCommander Marix judge advocate ofthe court It is possible howeverthat its arrival in Washington may bedelayed several days longer as AdmSicard said Monday nightLcquld scarcely say that the reportleavfe Axednesday - The courtShasjtically finished its work but somedetails may engage its attention longenough to keep the report here forseveral days I trust however thatthe navy department will have thedocuments in a very short timeThe decision reached by the court isstill a matter of surmise Perhapssome significance may be attached andconclusions drawn from a remarkmade by Adm Sicard when he said toa correspondentThe case of the Maine is mostculiar perhaps the most peculiarwhich has ever occurred in the historyof the worldFrom the general tone of his remarks it might be inferred that thecourt findings do not definitely solvethe mystery of the explosion This isfurther borne out by the admiralsstatement that even after the reporthad been sent to Washington the department may require further investigationAll rumors as to the report being already on its way to Washington wereset at rest Monday afternoon whenJudge Advocate Marix walked into thehotel and asked for Adm SicardIn the little writing room of the hotel Lieut Marix personally deliveredthe report to Adm Sicard CommanderWest of Adm Sicards staff thenjoined Lieut Marix and the

XIIIA groom was sent to Twineburgh fora doctor This was contrary to MrMorleys wish He insisted that a doctor was not necessary and it was onlyto appease the anxiety of his daughterthat he finalty consented to see a medical manBut all the daughters entreatiescould not move him to go to bed Hlay down on the couch in the libraryand Florence sat beside him holdingone of his hands I left them thus together and went outsideBefore I left the mans voice had resumed much of its usual vigor Forone who had seemed to be as near collapse as he strength returned very rapidlyNotwithstanding my pity for Florence there was great pride and joy inmy heart The sweetest girl in theworld was mine All troubles mysteries the heart sickness of the pastyear seemed petty and trivial besidethis thought Mr Morley had givenhis consent to our marriage indeedit was an absolute commandThe scene under the trees came backto me and I couldmot repress a shudderasI thoughtof the father s horriblepremonitions and the overwhelming effect produced by themI walked about the grounds or reclined on one of the many seats scattereoVaiiound determined to await thedoctors arrival My mind would constantly revert to the secret troublewhich was so evident and powerful afactor in Mr Morleys life and what itwas that could so affect a gentleman ofhis standing and wealth furnished mematter for speculation The greatmotive and influence in the fathers lifeI knew was his love for his only childTherefore it seemed that the hiddentrouble must arise from some sorrow ordanger which threatened FlorenceThe thought caused me considerableuneasinessI had not realized how morbidlysensitive the robbery had made me until now All the unf athomed events andincidents which had occurred duringthe two days I had been here seemed insome indefinable way connected withthe affair or the result of itThe doctor arrived much sooner thanI had expected Indeed the idea ofgiving medical advice to a great manlike Mr Morley was incentive strongenough to cause a country physician tokill his horse in the endeavor to reachthe patient as quickly as possibleAfter quite a time spent over Mr Morley the doctor stepped out on theporch and drawing on his gloves delayed his departure to answer a fewquestions which Florence who had followed put to him It was impossiblefor the worthj physician to concealwholly his sense of importance although he tried to appear as though itwas by no means an unusual thing to befound administering potions to millionairesFlorence anxiously listened to hiswords of advice and then withdrew Ihad some hope of speaking to her butshe only bestowed on me a sad sweatsmile which toldi of her love for meas well as her anxietv for the fatherand with that I had to be contentAs the doctor was returning immediately to Twineburgh I proposed to accompany him He expressed his pleasure in having a companion and Iclimbed into the carriage beside himI was anxious to tell Sonntag of themurderous attack upon me On theway finding the worthy doctor willingto answer questions I was soon possessed of his opinion of my lawyer and1agent This opinion was a very highoneSonntag seemed to have the elementsDf popularity in him But there wassomething about the old fellow I didnot understand there seemed to be agreat unknown depth to him beyondthe mere fact that he was a countrylawyer and vay agent NeverthelessI felt that he was to be trusted I feltsafe in his hands My own opinionso heartily corroborated by the doctor made me all the more satisfiedBut my trust and confidence in theold lawyer soon received a shockWhen we arrived at Sonntags officet sprang from the buggy and afterthanking the doctor walked up to thedoor Sonntag Avas walking Iwk andiorth with hia Lands behind him earwsyiTHE BOTJKBON NEWS PARIS EX FRIDAY MARCH 25 1898nestly conversing with some one inside There was also a rear door to thelawyers office A man was standingnear this door and when I entered theoffice he quickly stepped out not soquickly however but that I caught aglimpse of his face It was Hunter orSkinner as you pleaseThe thought of the treachery he hadbeen guilty of toward her in whose payhe was came to me and inflamed mewith sudden and uncontrollable angerUttering an expletive under the spurof a strong impulse I made a spring forhim Out through the door I followedhim and down through the yard Hehad too much the start however andwas over a high board fence at the bottom of the yard before I could come upto him -I retraced my steps to the lawyersoffice The old fellow was standing inthe door and seemed to have been highly diverted by witnessing the chasejudging by his faceThe rascal the villain I exclaimed pushing past the lawyer intothe office and sinking down pantingfor breath If ever I get my hand onhim Ill wring his neckSonntag closed the door and thenturned toward- me What have youagainst him he askedI recounted the shooting incidentto which Sonntag listened with a whimsical expressionHm And he shot at you when youcalled him Skinner eh he remarkedwhen I had finished Must be something in his former life but then wellits strange certainly Why I alwaysaddress him as Skinner and he neverattempted to shoot me indeed henever seemed to noticeThen it is evident his attempt toshoot me was not for my calling himby his right name See here Mr Sonntag I continued earnesly do yousuppose he is in any way concerned inthe cellar affairWho Skinner Good gracious nothat is I cant say but I think notWhat were you talking to himabout I asked eying the old fellowwith some impatience for the more Iconversed with him the less I could understand himOh about a matter of freight nryagent replied indifferentlyIt was trivial thentieverYes yes of no importance what-MrSonntag it is from no wish toknow the subject of jour conversationwith that wretch of a Skinner that Iask the question But I happened tosee you just before I entered the officeand I am a trifle curious to know if 3 ouusuall speak as earnestly on unimportant topics as you evidently did to himThe lawyer regarded me a momentHe seemd to be debating some questionin his mindWas I earnest he finally inquiredEverything about me seems to benrysterious I exclaimed piqued toimpatience at his wholly dodging myquestion Theres one mystery thatwill be cleared up soon however Iadded decidedlyYes And that is- A -The cellar mystery - VSonntag again cautioned me againstbeing too precipitateThen give me some good reason foryour caution I exclaimed Its getting monotonous following peoples advice without having a reason for sodoing Ill do so no more I have halfa notion to get out of the place Eversince my arirval petty trivial circumstances have harassed me and keptme in an irritable moodWell maybe it would be best foryou to visit some of your friends intown Sonntag said reflectively ifonly for a few daysNo sir I have no friends and yourseeming desire to have me away makesme the more determined to stay Buta course of supineness is done withNow Ill take the reins and see whaiTlsto be made out of the drivingJust as you please about that ofcourse Mr Conway But I do beg ofyou and it is for your own interests Ispeak delay the attempt to enter thecellar until to morrowWhy I curtly askedYoull know in the morning mylawyer replied with a smileI mny be dead by that time I replied Certainly if I must be the target for every assassins bullet mycoffin might as well be ordered nowSaying which I took my own pistolfrom my pocket You see that Wellit means that after this Ill be as handywith a pistol asothers areMr Sonntag eyed me rather suspiciously as though not at all certainbut that I would level the weapon athimThose things are dangerous MrConway and are liable to go off withoutwarning he remarked dryly after Ihad returned the pistol to my pocketYes I know that And if thereshould be occasion for it to go off in myhand j ou may be sure it will be forthe purpose of hitting something Ibelieve nry peace is threatened if notmy life How do I know but wha t thatcellar under my room has been usedmaybe is being used for some criminalpurpose If that is true my arrivalin Nelsonville and taking up my aboderight in the midst of hidden crimewould naturally prevent any continuance of operations and endanger thesecret I believe that attempts arebeing made to cause me to leave ifmjsterious demonstrations cannot accomplish it by frightening me thenthe purpose is to remove me by deathThere may be something in whatyou sa Sonntag remarked after amoments thought But promise meyou will not attempt to shoot the station agent he added with deep earnestnessWhat Make no defense againsthis cowardly attacks I exclaimed inamazement at my lawyers requestHe will not repeat it voninaybejsure At least promise to defer retaliation until to morrowVkAnd gct shot in the meantime-ANo I said it would not happenagainJust let me get my hands on himIU1 choke the life out of him was theonly reply I madeOh yes thats all right Choke himall you want to but please Mr 0bnway no shooting I dont mind telling jou that any headstrong course onyour part may upset a few well laidplans for your own good which givepromise now of fruitful results Waituntil to morrow You shall know allthen I promise youIt is impossible to convey by wordsthe seriousness of my lawyers mannerin making these remarksWhen I was conversing with MrSonntag there was something abouthim which compelled me to feel trustand confidence notwithstanding hismany sayings bearing on some secretpurpose which he was so careful notto revealWell I give up trying to make youout I said after considering hiswords and being impressed by themYou certainly are the most inexplicable specimen of a country lawyerWho are you anyhowYour lawyer and agent and MrConway let me add in sincerity yourfriendSomehow I could not but believe himat the tiime His words carried convictionPardon me for seeming impertinent Sonntag said as he accompaniedme to the door but have you seen MissMorley since your arrivalYesAnd everything is all rightYesYou intend marrying herI have her fathers consentAh I congratulate youSonntag extended his hand andsmiled But the smile died away immediately and the expression which followed strangely disturbed me Was itsorrow For what Or was it pitySurely not pity for meI went from the office resolved to follow my lawyers advice just this onceTo morrow was not far distant and Iwould know all then Wondering verymuch what -this all would prove to be Istarted on my five anile walk homewardFortunately I encountered Sarahwho had driven to Twineburgh to dosome trading and who was just climbing into her wagon as I came upHello Sarah I called as she wasabout to take up the lines Will yougive me a liftShe looked around in surprise thenexpressed her pleasure at seeing meagain as I climbed up beside herAs we were crossing the track at Sidington I was considerably surprised toir p j pWas it really the face of Horace Jacksonsee the station agent at work on theplatform handling some freight Thefellow really seemed to be ubiquitousI had encountered him in Nelsonvillein Sonntags office and now again atthe station attending to his dutiesHis back was toward us and he didnot notice the wagon and its occupantsSarah pulled up the team at my request and I climbed down from thewagon I was curious to note againwhat effect my presence would have onthe fellow When I had moved somedistance from the team for I did notpropose to endanger Sarahs life incase he took it into his head to fire atme again rjlacing my hand on my revolver as it rested in my pocket Icalled to himHello there I say you SkinnerThe fellow dropped the truck handlesand turned quickly Then he fled swiftly along the platform toward the doorof the station house thrpugh which heboltedBut I was not watching him Hisflight and the manner of it was perceived simply because his form was inthe line of visionIt was upon the bow window in thetelegraph office that my gaze was fixedFor at my hail a face had appeared atthat window and then was quicklywithdrawnDid my sight deceive me or was itreally the face of Horace JacksonFollowing a natural impulse Isprang upon the platform and went tothe door It was locked Then I triedthe door leading into the ladies waiting-roombut that was also lockedI walked around the place a few timesand peered into each window but noone was to be seenIt was no surprise that the fellowSkinner should wish to avoid me butif the other face I had seen belonged toJackson why should he desire to hidefrom meProbably Jackson having heard thatI was residing at Nelsonville and knowing that I must therefore have metFlorence Morley and have been informed by her of his contemptible manner of trying to win her thought itbest not to meet meIf he wished to avoid me he was atliberty to do so It was a trivial circumstance at any rate and so I left theplatform and climbed back upon thewagonVhatfor he rim soinqmredSarahaa sue o rove on 7 -Oh yhaveV little account tbsettlewith him and he is afraid of me 1suppose I repliedDer yas amoder man too in de vinrder she continuedYou saw

endeavor to ootaln more light but I didnot gratify her curiosity and answeredony in monosyllablesMy rnd was in even a greater whirlof perplexity than my old nursesWhy had Skinner tried to shoot meand why after thus showing some powerful animosity toward me should henow appear such a craven that he fledevidently in great fear from my presence What was thefellows real intentand pwpose in engaging himself toFlorence as a detective Was he reallya detectiveJacicson had recommended him toFlorence What bond existed betweenJacbc and Skinner And moreoverwho was Soniiriaj These three menseemed somehow strtfirily connectedwith my life but how and to what endSarah do you know aboutMr Sonntag I finally askedAch yes He is your lawyer aintheYes yes But do you know anything-about him He has not been in Twineburgh very long has heNo Aboud six months He is avery nice man and a goot von tooSarah replied convincing-That seems to be the general opinion regarding him Do you know anything about the station

warewholly without exact information asto the findings of the court of inquirythey found themselves sharing in theapparently intangible conviction thatthe cause of the explosion was not accidental Opinions expressed by theMaine survivors who reached herelast Saturday doubtless has contributed largely to this view in official circles In this connection itis understood that one of the officers who arrived on Saturday statednot as opinion but as his personal bservation on the night of the disasterthat there were two distinct explosionsThe tendency of this is to support thetheory of external

of an amiableyoung lady with a view to matrimonyAddress in confidence X 160 office ofthis paperHe smiled grimly as he read it over inprint wondering with curious interestwhat sort of replies he would get andliow he should treat them Althoughliterally speaking he was unattachedfc 4 tKat is to pay although there was nospoken engagement between him and hisold plajmate and friend Nellie Marshhe felt that he was sufficiently idolized by that lady and sufficiently underthe spell of her charms to defy theiiossible influence of any of the applicants however fascinatingMoreover as his income was at present too modest to permit of his marrying anybody he went into the jest witha double sense of safetyThe replies were several and on the-whole not interesting Most of themwere from matrimonial

thatin following up the joke he would runa risk of making an ass of himself orworse After all it was clear therewas not much fun to be got out of theaffair and he was about to put this reply with the

in confidence ALICE TOWNSHENDIt would be impossible to describethe wonderment of Mr Pellingham onreceipt of this amazing communication The photo was certainly that ofa pretty girl yet Who is Alice Townshend And what on earth can shewant with me were the questions hestill kept asking himself after puttingever possible and impossible construction on the letter In the end curiositydecided that he must at least keep theappointment if he ever hoped to solvethe problemAccordingly at the time and placereferred to he found himself anxiouslyawaiting the appearance of the mysterious stranger who Avas growing allthe more mysterious in not being present Five ten fifteen minutes passedand yet nobody appeared answering tothe description and he was about toquit the place under the impressionthat some fool had been playing a hoaxon him when I beg youppardonwas uttered by himself and another almost in the one breathThe lady he had bobbed into was attired in black and under other circumstances would have passed unnoticedThe mutual apology however broughttheir eyes together and he had a goodmemory for facesMiss Townshend I presumeThe lady paused and turned palethen blushing violently spoke like athief caught in the actMr Pellingham I believeThat is my name replied that gentlemanI really I had no notion of keepingthis appointment I took the wholething as a jestYet you have kept it said the former smilingIn a sense yes Im afraid I mustplead guilty to curiosity at the lastmomentMine is a similar confessionAn embarrassing silence followedthis double admission which Mr Pellingham was the first to break MayI ask Miss Townshend how you became acquainted with me and why youmade this appointmentAt this direct challenge the ladyseyes widened with astonishment Youare the Mr Pellingham that wrote tome are you not she askedIt was his turn to look astonishedWrote to you he repeated Certainly not I dont understand Im afraidthere is some mistakeA sudden glance of suspicion greetedthis remark but was quickly dispelledby his air of candid bewildermentPardon me she said as she producedfrom her handbag a letter and a photograph and handed them to him theseare from you I presumeHe examined both and began toscent the truth The photo is minehe replied but not the letter Evidently some mischievous acquaintanceof mine whose handwriting I cantidentify has been playing a practicaljoke on usGood gracious Then you knownothing about this advertisementShe handed him the cuttinsrHe read it and looked up with a smileI am not responsible for this I assureyouWell what a stupid jestI quite agree with youThere was a pause each looked at theother and tried to appear very much annoyed It was a failure however andthey both laugheduHer thoughts at that moment wereWhat a fiuely made handsome man heis A gentleman evidently He hasturned 30 thoughOn the other hand he was at a lossto decide whether her most captivatingfeature was the charm of lier voice herunquestionable refinement or thebeauty of her face but he gave up thequery as one unaccustomed to such riddlesAllow me to return your photoshe saidAnd I yours he answeredThe exchange was effected with mutual apologies which latter of coursewere unnecessary but they served toprolong the interview The lady wasthe first to make a move Good nightMr Pellingham she said extendingher hand I regret our introductionwas not of a more formal characterHe took her hand It was dainty andneatly gloved and in the novelty of hissensations he could barely refrain frompressing it Good night Miss Townshend he replied rather awkwardlyadding with a sudden and curious desire to know more of the I dontfeel disposed to let the matter drop Imust try and find the perpetrator of thishoax and demand an apologydont trouble on my accountwas the response as I told you I wasnot in earnest myselfHe bowed and raised his hat at thesame time making a last desperate effort to retain the acquaintanceship Itake it then you have no further interest in the matterShe hesitated a moment and looked ather boot It was a trifling action but itemboldened him to addOtherwise I should ask permissionin case I do make any discovery to dropa line or communicate with you I stillhave your address you knowAgain she looked at him and instinctconvinced her that he was a gentlemanShe answeredPray do what you think fit MrPellingham and now good nightagainGood night Miss Townshend andthank youinA month had elapsedIn the interim Pellinghams endeavors to discover the humorous advertiseras he facetiously termed him were sofar without result His motive however in still keeping hiseyes open wasnot as at first to thrash the fellow onthe ladys account but to thank himon his own for having brought him intorelationship with the dearest and prettiest girl in the- world Which provesin short that Pellingham had not beenat all idleNeither had Tom Brunner jin anotherconnection In fact the month hadbeen so big with other events for thisindividual that he had as good as forgotten the incident of the advertisement He was just landing home fromthe continent having in the meantimedone so well for the firm he representedthat his business position was alreadydouble its former importance and thefuture was full of bright prospectsIn the meantime also among strangefaces in strange lands he had missedvery keenly the society of his idealNellie Marsh and the many pleasantrecollections he indulged in concerningher had all the more charnrfor him nowthat he was at length in a position toconfess his loveHe had left Charing Cross and wasturning into the Strand when a voicebehind him said Tom Whereverhave you sprung fromHe turned and his heart gave a leapof delight Nellie What a fortunatemeetingThe surrounding commotion prevented any display of sentiment He managed however to explain the cause ofhis absence and convey to her some ideaof his recent success wnereat shelooked at him proudly and smiled withall lier eld kindliness as she saidI cant tell you how delighted I amTom but Im not surprised to hear ofyour getting on You know Ive always believed in youOf course you have Nellie he responded and he felt that the momentwas the happiest he had ever knownBut you are not the only one with astory to tell she added smiling significantlyIndeed Out with it then he answered lightly Your bus wont behere for ten minutesWell once upon a time that is tosay about a month ago some personor persons unknown put a matrimonialadvertisement in a daily paperHe gave a start and looked at hersharply but her eyes were wanderingfor the moment and she continuedNow it happened that a very intimatefriend of mine named Miss Townshendanswered the advertisement for the funof the thing and gave the address of hermilliner whom she took into her confidenceWell he asked prepared by thistime for further surprisesWell what do you think Tom Theadvertisement turned out to be a hugehoax and instead of meeting the advertiser as arranged the lady made theacquaintance of a Mr Alfred Pellingi amPellingham I fancy I know thegentlemanYou see he kept the appointmentout of sheer not knowing whothe lady was or why she had written tohim Of course the joker had written toher first of all from the wrong addressI hope you follow meOf course I follow you But I sayNellie what on earth lias all thisWait a minute Im coming to thedenouement as they say in the novelsPardon me said Tom with a smileI think I can guess the sequel Yourlady friend and Mr Pellingham felldesperately in love at the first meetin and have met several times sincewith the result that they are now engaged to be marriedThey are marriedReally that is a romance I suppose Nellie you were the principalbrdesmaidOh no TomNo By the way this Miss Townshend that was who is sheShe is my

he gaspedYes I Tom she replied addingsome words of friendly parting whichwere a vague recollection by the timethe bus had whirled her out of sightand he had begun to realize the truthShe was right he

leaveChicago every afternoon on the Chicago8c Northwestern railroad was almostready to pull out bound forkee and stopping at the larger stationThe train is a popular one and on thisparticular occasion the smoking coachwas well filled with a mixture of drummers commuters and occasional travelers all of whom were busy playingcards smoking or reading the afternoon papersAbout three minutes before the scheduled time for departure the smokerscard players and readers were startledby a shrill feminine voice that fairly shrieked out the inquiryHas anyone got a commutationticket to WaukeganEvery passenger turned his face inthe direction from which the voice proceeded and expressions of surprise appeared on the countenances of all whenthey saw the author of the disturbanceShe was not a bad looking Americangirlr possibly 22 years of age ratherwell dressed and she stood fearlesslyin the aisle apparently nothing dauntedby the fact that she was the only womanin the car Before anyone had time toform an opinion as to what she was doing in the smoker she shouted out oncemore this time not quite so loudlyas she now had the attention of allpresentI say has anyone here got a commutation ticket to Waukegan Thatplagued gateman will not let my friendsthrough without a ticket There aretwo of them He thinks we are goingto pay full fare when we can just aswell buy4 commutation rides from someone on the train and save 30 cents Irushed by him before he could stopme Cant some one help us fool himQuick The train is ready to start thisminuteApparently no one within shoutingdistance had a commutation ticket toWaukegan and the girl might havegone without it had not a very stoutgentleman just then entered the carand made his way down the aisle to theonly vacant seat half way to the endHe had not heard the inquiry but as hewas depositing an armful of bundles inthe empty seat a drummer sitting nextasked him if he did not happen to havea commutation ticket to WaukeganYes he affably replied do youwant a ride at the same time extracting the ticket from his walletThe sight of the ticket was the signal for the now interested spectatorsand every man of them with a remarkable spontaneity began to shoutHeres one Heres one at the sametime pointing toward the stout gentleman who ticket in band and a puzzledlook on his face was standing in theaisle evidently wondering what it allmeantThe girl did not leave him long in suspense She shouted out in reply to themany encouraging voices Gee whizTet me have it quick and darting inthe I direction of the stout gentlemanhad snatched the ticket from his handaivas gone before he could say JackRobinson every one in the car clapping his hands and yelling Go it Goit Youve got time yet That isevery one save the stout gentlemanwho still in the dark evidently beganto suspect that his fellow passengerswere leagued together to rob him ofhis commutation ticketThe heads that were thrust out of thewindows on the right saw the girl andher two friends emerge through thegate about ten seconds later She puther two friends on the rear platformjust as the train was starting but managed to take time to shake her fist atthe distant gateman as she shoutedback before jumping aboard herselfThats the time you got left didntyouIn the smoker the readers went backto their papers the smokers to theircigars and the players to their cardsall except the stout commuter whosequestions and inquiries for some explanation were only answered by catcalls jeers and cries of Bunco Hetoo finally subsided apparently convinced that he had in reality been bun-coed and despairing of sympathy fromthose around him He was only relievedfrom this conviction by the conductorwho when the train was about tenmiles out brought to him from a rearcar his commutation ticket with silverand copper to make up for the threerides shyThe commuters on this road admitthat other communities may have theirenterprising girls but it is hard to convince them that any community canproduce the peer of this particular Waukegan commuter for enterprise coupledwith iron nerve And they claim theyought to know N Y SunCold Meat PieCut up the meat and rub each piecein a

rather eminent author Lassaid consists in the name When youget a good name you get a mineWhich is true not only of the title of thenarrative itself but also of the characters which figure in it Once a writerof fiction confessed that he hadsearched the signboards for names andon the day when he saw Milling tonRickaby painted on a lawyers door heproduced the best story of his life onthe inspiration of that cognomen Butit is not always safe to do this Theproof is right hereThe writer of this department journeying in the Teton country just southof the Yellowstone park some years agoheard among other names mentionedthat of Brig Adams That Brig Adamsreally existed was never stated thename was simply carried into a conversation when and under what circumstances is a matter of hazy memoryBut although the details of the firsthearing of that appellation have longsince faded the name lived in recollection lived on waiting for a storyto be written That was the last of thename and having been used it passedalong the way of all used up literarymaterialThat is to say it was believed to bethe last of it But it was not in factA few days ago Robert Anderson ofIdaho Falls Idaho wrote to say withgreat courtesy that a mistake had beenmade There was a Brig Adams andhe wasnt the kind of man the yarnpictured him at all He did not fit anypart of the storied description notphysically morally intellectually orotherwise Besides which he had beenHead for a long time sacrificed his lifein a heroic manner to save and help an-other Parenthetically it may bej said that they do that kind of thing inJackson s HoleI have this to say of Adams theIdaho man writes not because demortuis nil nisi bonum but because hewas no such man as the storv nictnrpsj him Mr Adams was a ranchman inj Jacksons Hole a stalwart firm-look-ing man of about 30 He was not college bred but had a good commonschool education He was distinguishedfor his courteous bearing to all andwas as straight morally as well asphysically as the pine trees on the adjacent mountains The Actress MaudeAdamswas bythe way his niece Neither was he the unsophisticated man thepicture makes him He did a lucrativebusiness in supplying some of the parksas far east as New England with deerand elk and on his trips became fairlywell acquainted with several of theeastern cities In short he stood wellBut the manner of his death shows himmore than a straightforward businessman A new settler came into Tacks on sHole late in the fall of 1S9G The newcomer was ill provided for the winternot even a cabin to take his familyinto Mr Adams was never behindhand in such cases He started at oncethrough the snow to the new manscamp brought new life to the despondent family and got to work with awill though no reward was promisedor desired While engaged in this GoodSamaritan work a decayed limb fellfrom a tree he was chopping for houselogs The limb struck him squarelyon the head andhis skull was crushedin The man after a time got help totake him home There is no doctor inJacksons Hole But his resolute youngwife nursed him night and day for aweek when death came to his reliefThus according to Mr Andersonsdescription the real Brig Adams theman who supplied the name but noother essential part of the light littleanecdote was a man worth knowingThe writer is sorry that he did notknow himAs before remarked while a nameis a splendid thing for a fictionmaker tohave in stock it is likely to prove embarrassing unless it is absolutely certainly and unequivocally fictitiousEven then it is best to choose anotherChicago

British territory since 1895But this estimate may be far too highfor everything is overrated in the Klondike country Until recently the goldproduct of 1897 was figured at 10000000 By degrees this exorbitant estimate suffered reduction First it wascut in two Now comes an official state-mentfrom Ottawa which places the out-piit of 1897 at 2500000 Estimates ofthis years yield of gold run up to 25000000 This is the figure given outby the combination having mines tosell Since last fall over 300 men havearrived from Dawson with claims tosell It is estimated that they have over2000 claims to put on the market Someof these claims are mythical All thesurveyors on earth could not locatethem Others are as valuable for placermining as is Lincoln park in ChicagoAll these men agree that the Klondike claims will yield 25000000 in goldthis year They also say that the Alaska Commercial company and the NorthAmerican Trading and Transportationcompany hold in their safes at Dawsonover 7000000 of the yield of 1S97 Asa matter of fact the companies at Dawson do not hold over 1000000A little figuring will show how muchwork the Klondike miners will have todo to run their yield up to

the purest and most carefullyselected Drugs regardlessof cost withthe Bulbs of the Roots and Stems of theHerbs by our secret process extracted andthrown away cannot be sold at less than 25cents- The reason of the difference is thisOn June 80th 1893 the Supreme Courtenjoined J H Zeilin Co from manufacturing and selling medicine under the nameof Dr Simmons Liver MedicineZeilins answer to our bill said the medicine was designed as cheap negro medicine for the negroes of the Mississippi Valley And Zeilins manager testified in thecase and Zeilins advertisements said thatall the Liver Medicinethey make is made bythe same formula What more conclusiveevidence could there be that all their LiverMedicine is cheap negro medicineAgain the United States Court in theZeilin case at Knoxville Tenn enjoined theold proprietors of the article now calledBlack Draught from perpetrating fraudby using the words constituting our tradename and Black Draught was not knowntill after 1876 yet they falsely advertise thatit was established in 1840 and filch our tradeby allowing their customers to untruthfullyrepresent it as the same as our genuine article they giving color of truth to the deception by
