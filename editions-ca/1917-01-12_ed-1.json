United States Consul W. J. Yerby,
reporting to the Department of For
eign Commerce, Washington, D. C,
fnlm Dakar, states that the greatei
part of the tobacco imported Into that
territory is in the natural leaf form.
Although statistics as to its source
are not available, it appears that at
least 95 per cent of it originates In
the United States. In 1915 imports of
leaf tobacco into the French colonies
amounted to $881,614 in value, against
$529,369 in 1914. Imports into the
British colonies totaled in value ?2,
126.515. against $l,372i717 in 1914.
Practically all of the manufactured
tobacco imported is of cigarettes,
hermetically sealed in tins. The na
tives take readily to the cigarette,
and their preference for them to the
leaf and pipe is growing rapidly, it Is
said.
The only representative of Ameri
can tobacco in West Africa is at
Dakar, where a large American export
ing company has a branch in which
from 30 to 40 natives are regularly
engaged in "retreating" the tobacco
consumed in Senegal. The market
seetms to be present still further op

leaf tobacco.

I WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. In themosc
! sweeping of all decisions upholding
prohibition laws, the Supreme Court
j Monday held constitutional and valid
the Webb-Kenyon law prohibiting
'shipments of liquor from "wet" to
I "dry" States. The court also sustain-
j 'ea west irgmias recent, araenuraeni
$3 'to her law prohibiting importation in
interstate commerce for personal use.
After being vetoed by President.
iTaft, who lield it unconstitutional, the
I Webb-Kenyon act was repassed over
jhis veto and the law Monday was sua
itained in the Supreme Court by a
jvote of seven to two. Leaders ot the
prohibition movement regard tne law
as second in importance only to the
proposed constitutional amendment.
Lawyers for the liquor interest, who
heard the decision, admit that it up
holds and applies the law "in its full-
Icau aciiac.
It was announced that Justice Mc
Reynolds concurred in the decision,
but not completely m the opinion.
Justices Holmes and Vandeventcr
were the two dissenting justices.
"The all-reaching power of Gov
ernment over liquor is settled," said
the Chief Justice in announcing the
decision. "There was no intention of
Congress to forbid individual use of
liquor. The purpose of this act was
to cut out by the roots the .practice
of permitting violation of State liquor
laws. We can have no doubt that
Congress has complete authority to
prevent paralyzing of State authori
ties. Congress exerted a power to co
ordinate the National with the State
authority."
Wayne E. Wheeler, counsel for the
Anti-Saloon League of America, who
with Fred Blue, State Prohibition Com
missioner of West Virginia, argued the
case before the Court made this state
ment on the Court's decision:
