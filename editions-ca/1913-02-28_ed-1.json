at the head ,of the Battle Creek Club
ofthe Southern Michigan League, con
templates cominR to Paris to do a Dart
of his SDriug traininc before the open

Leaeue.
In a letter written to Edw. Doyle
of this city, McKernan expressed a de
sire to come to Paris and spend a
cduple ot weeks with his men fitting
them for the approaching season, and
asked that tentative arrangemenc be
made with the management of the
local club to that end. Mr. Doyle has
communicated the facts to the Paris
management and it is likely McKernan
will reachia decision in a few days as
to whether he will train here or have
his men report to Battle Creek.
It is planned by McKernan to bring
practically all the members of his
team to Paris and put them through
the initial training stunt and have
them -ready before they go to Battle
Creek, where it is said unseasonable
weather preventB early spring practice
and from the fact that the" season
there opens early jn May it is neces
