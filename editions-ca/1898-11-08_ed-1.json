Eye Massase
Whenever your organs of sight feel
weak do not claw at them with tho
knuckles so to express it You must
not massage your eyes the same way
yon would the stronger parts of the
body They need help from the hands
but this help must he administered in a
very gentle and delicate method
John Quincy Adams had a way of
treating his eyes which it is said
preserved their vision to old age with
out the help of spectacles
This was to place his thumb and fore
finger each upon an eyelid and gently
rub them toward the nose a number of
times each day The action encourages
circulation of blood in that locality
does away with the tiny spots that
sometimes float before the vision and
prevents that flattening of the lenses
which causes dimness of sight at a cer
tain focus
It is wonderful how much good can
be done the eyes of people of all ages by
using this simple exercise 10 or 15 min
utes each day
If you are where it may not be con
venient to measure time as in the dark
it is well to count the number of passes
made by the fingers over the eyes until
you have reached the number that you
have demonstrated by experiment that
time will allow New York Ledger
Her First Order
She was newly married and did not
know a little bit about either house
keeping or shopping and she was giv
ing her very first order It was a crush
er but the grocer was a clever man and
was used to all kinds of orders and
could interpret them easily
I want ten pounds of paralyzed sug
ar she began with a businesslike air
Yesm Anything else
Two cans of condensed milk
Yesm
He set down pulverized sugar and
condensed milk
Anything more maam
A bag of fresh salt Be sure its
fresh
Yesm What next
A pound of desecrated codfish
He wrote glibly desiccated cod
Nothing more maam We have
some nice horse radish just in
No she said It would be of no
use to us We dont keep a horse
Then the grocer sat down and fanned
himself with a patent washboard al
though the temperature was nearly
zero New York World
Iviraicss
In some portions of Germany the
kirmess or church mass formerly
danced in honor of the dedication of a
church is now observed with the special
character of a harvest home It marks
the close of the years labors and is cele
brated by three days of music feasting
and dancing with partners chosen or al
lotted according to degrees of
ness at the preceding May festival
In southern Germany the end of the
harvest is marked by the sickle feast
The last sheaf is carried in triumph to
the barn and placed on the floor while
the younger couples dance around it
One half of it is then decked with rib
bons and hung aloft while the other
half is burned Its ashes are treasured
as a remedy for rheumatism and are
sometimes used in making amulets or
charms The peasants leave for Wodan
or the old one a few ears of corn
and a small number of apples it being
considered unlucky to strip either field
or tree entirely bare Lippincotts
Letters and Trade

affinity between letters and trade

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Crvil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of cmlized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to- North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and the Buell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers botfremanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The tcwalk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the- latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its- ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit-
