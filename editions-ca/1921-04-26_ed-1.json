The protracted meeting which
has been in progress at the Methodist
church for the past three weeks'
closed Sunday night. It was perhaps
the most successful revival ever held
in Millersburg. Evangelist Xendall
took possession of his audiences in the
hperinnins of the meeting, and .was
able to hold their attention through
every service. His audiences contin
ued to grow larger from the first, and
during the last week of the meeting
all of the available space of the audi
toriiijm and lecture room was occupi
ed. As the meeting drew nearer to
a close his v sermons became more
forible, and larger numbers responded
to various invitations. His sermons
on Sunday on "Baptism of The Holy
Soirit" and again on Sunday night
Ion "Soul Restoration" were perhaps
the most forcible sermons ever de
livered in MHlersburg. Sunday was a
:
husv dav in church fifoinc here. Sun
day afternoon Song Leader Parker'
delivered an interesting address to a
large audience n the church on
"Home and the Bible." Saturday
evening at 7:00 the Booster Choir
under the direction of song leader
Parker, gave an interesting enter
tainment as a prelude tp the regular
church services, which was enjoyed
by all who heard him. They received
encores on several nupnbers. When
the meeting closed Mr. Parker had a
larger choir doing good wrok. Dur
ing the past week there were decided
gains in the cottage prayer meeting,
which will be .kent un once a week.
ThP first, meetine will be with Mr
J. T. Toadvine to-day. There were
also large gains in the business
men's prayer meetings, which closed
Saturday morning at the Farmers
Bank with jmore than seventy pres
ent. On the whole, this revival per
haps was the most far-reaching ever
held in Millersburg, as it seemed to
take hold on all classes. A large
thank offering was taken up on Sun
day for the evangelists, and quite a
large number of new converts will be
added to each churcn. Evangelists
Kendall and Parker leave Millersburg
with the good will of all our people
who wish them unbounding success
wherever they go.
Ebenezer Presbyterial will con
vene in the Millersburg Presbyterian
church Tuesday afternoon at 2:30.
Tuesday night Mr. Grafton, of China,
and Mr. Erickson, of Phelps, will be
