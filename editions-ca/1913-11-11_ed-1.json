Our town was .shrouded in dark
ness Saturday night. About 5 o'clock
the electric lights went -out, and it
was impossible to repair the plant so
as to use it during the night. The
fault was found to be in the pump,
which refused to work properly.
However, it was placed in good condi
tion Sunday and the lights are now
working admirably. The plant was
installed in January, 1911, and Sat
urday was the first night that the"
consumers have been without lights.
On one occasion some months ago
the lights were out of commission for
about an .hour, and with these two. ex--ceptions
they have not given one bit
of trouble, since the plant was in
stalled. There are few small towns
that cab, lay claim to such a good rec
ord. Mrs. E. M. Ingels entertained. Sat
urday afternoon, from 2 to 5, a num

The color scheme was pink and white
which was nicely carried, out. Pink
carnations were in great profusion
iri all the roomr. There were four
teen tables tof rook, and a number
who did not indulge in the games
were present. Six games were play
ed, .but no prizes were given. At the
close of the games ice cream, choco
late bon-borfs and egg kisses were
served. Mrs. Ingels was assisted in
entertaining by her daughter, Miss

How to Dieted the;
Alum Baking Powder l
II
"Which are the alum -baking powders;
how can I avoid them unless they are named?'
asks a housekeeper.
, Here is one way: take the can of a low?
priced powder in your hand and read the
ingredient clause upon 'the back label The
law requires that if the powder contains alum
that fact must be there stated. If you find
one of the ingredients named alum, or sul
phate of aluminum, you have found an alum
baking powder.
There is another and a better way. You
don't 'have to know the jiames of the alum
powders. Use Royal'Baking Powder only;
that assures you a cream of tartar powder,
..and thevpurest and most healthful baking
powaer Deyona question.
leaf tobacco quantity
Report is delayed.
The Census Bureau has completed
its canvass of the quantity of leafto-
acco on hand on October 1 last. As
yet, however, the Bureau has been un-
able to announce the result, but tabu-
nations are proceeding and it is staled
.hat the statistics will be .made public
probably November 15.
Director William R Harris of the
Census Bureau, said today tha much
iifficulty is being experienced in the
collection of the data because many
dealers either intentionally or wilfully
neglect "to "make the ensus reports un
til they are repeatedly reminded of
the requirements of the law, and in
some cases it has been necessary to
threaten to enforce the penal provis
ions. The law requires that these-reports
shall be made to the Govern
mentApril 1 and Octoberl eachyear.
When the law first became effective
" wncs nrnorv to spnd special agents
ino the field to enforce compliance,
ny ueirtyt a the work and also en
tailed much expense of an unneces
sary nature. "Recently, however, the
dealers and manufacturers have
shown more willingness to comply
with the law. ,
SAVING THE DAY.
"A bad mess," declared the junior
partner. "Lot of urgent mail to be

"The office boy is always fooling
