A largeiiumoer or tne twenty-three oldbeneficiaries did not seek assistance"u,u " j.uuu iur me next year.There is a very regretable tendencyon the partjof many beneficiaries toleave school before they have finished their work, even in the localHigh Schools of the county. Veryfew, indeed, are persistent enough tofinish in our colleges. No doubt thebenefactor, Mr. Garth, intended toeducate bright boys thoroughly,So we think it would be the part ofwisdom to encourage young men tocontinue their studies until graduation frcrn a standard college. Thedearth of laborers on the farm andin every line of work has, we think,caused many benefactors to quitschool, being attracted by the highwages now paid tc the unskilled.One thoroughly educated man isworth more to the country than ascore of the half-educated and inefficieni. The cry of the world isfor intelligent, capable, educatedmen and women."Those recommending applicantsshould be sure of the mental, moral-and financial status of the boy.The Commissioners very often haveno other way of judging of theworthiness and fitness of applicantsexcept as they are recommended tothem by friends and neighbors.

Liuse and registration fees alone last year amountedto 554,700,000, and practically allthis sum wai, unvoted to road maintenance and construction. The highway officials estimate tbat there are2,475,000 miles of highway in thecountry, and a simple long divisionproblem shows that theie are threecars to every mile of highway.Aalabapna, Arkansas, Mississippi,Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma,South Dakota and Wyoming havene car or less for every mile a'nd ahalf of their roads. But RhodeIsland brings up the average by producing pnore than twenty cars to emile. Massachusetts has thirteenjnd two-tenths cars to the mile andNew Jersey's average is only slightly less. California has seven and, eisaUlenllifc cars to the mile.WASHINGTON, August 5. Increases in freight, passenger, Pullman and other railroad rates approximating an unofficial estimate of$1,400,000,000 have been approved by the Interstate CommerceCommission, effective on five daysnotice by the carriers to the commission and the public.The advance is 40 per cent in railroad freight rates in the East; 25per cent, in the South; 35 per cent,in the West, and 25 per cent, in theMountain-Pacific territory.Passenger fares were increased 20per cent, the amount asked by therailroads to help in absorbing the$600,000,000 wage increase grantedby the Railroad Labor Board.A surcharge of 50 per cent onrates for sleeping and parlor carswas granted together with a 20 percent increase in the rates on excessbaggage and 20 per cent in the rateson milk.The freight increase total is estimated at $1,134,000,000 on the basisof 6 per cent, on the $18,900,000,000 placed by the commission on theproperties of all the roads. The increase of 40 per cent, in the East isestimated to yield approximately$750,000,000.The 25 per cent, granted Southernroads is estimated to yield about$100,000,000, while the Western andMountain-Pacific roads will get anincreased return of about $284,000,000 on freight rates.This total is about $200,000,000less than the amount for which therailroads asked to absorb the $600,-000,000 wage award by the RailroadLabor Board and to bring their netincome to the 6 per cent, providedfor in the transportation act.To the increase of $1,134,000,000to the nation's freight bill will beadded an increase in passenger ratesaggregating $232,827,989; an increase in Pullman rates aggregating$43,639,344; an advance in excessbaggage rates approximating $1,420,999 and an advance in milk rates ofabout $5,000,000.The increases granted are designed to give the roads a net of 5 percent, on one-half of one per cent, tomake what the commission describedas "appropriate provision for additional improvements, betterments orequipment of a character chargableto capital account.The commission also gave electricrailway lines permission to increasetheir freight rates by the same percentage as were approved for trucklines in the same territory. The commission added that this was "not tobe construed as an expression of disapproval of increases, made or proposed in the regular manner, in thepassenger fares of electric lines."Coastwise steamship lines wereauthorized to increase their freightrates "to the same extent as hereingranted the railroads operating between the same points or in the sameterritory." The commission ruledthat in construction of rail-and-lakerates the present parity between Chicago and Duluth should be maintained. In arriving at the increases thecommission placed the valuation ofthe railroad properties at $18,900,000,000 as against the $20,616,000,000 estimate of the railroad executives. The increases may become effective on five days' notice given by thecarriers to the commission and thepublic and they must be put into effect before January 1, 1921. Sincethe government guarantee to theroads expires September 1, it is generally expected that the advances willbe put into force before that date.The commission authorized the application of the general increase tothe rates on commodities. Specialrates have heretofore prevailed andthe charges therefore will be increased according to percentage ordered in the various groups.In their original application for increases, tne roads divided the country into three groups Eastern,Western and Southern. They askedfreight rates increases of 39.75 forthe Eastern, 32.63 for the Westernand 38.91 for the Southern.The commission divided the Western group into two, the Western andthe Mountain-Pacific, the latter taking in the territory lying betweenthe .Pacific Coast and the easternbase of the Rocky Mountains.The commission also, on its owninitiative, applied the general increases to all special services performed by the carriers. It explainedin its decision that the railroads hadnot included this provision in its proposal, but stated that this was due toa misunderstanding.It therefore authorized the increases to apply to switching, weighing, diversion, reconsignment, lighterage frontage, storage and transferand such separate charges as may bemade against the shippers for anyother special services.With respect to the prevailingrates on commodities which aretransported under special traffic arrangements, the commission orderedthat the general increases should beadded to the present freight charges.SOCIALISTS F0UN3? GUILTYCHICAGO, Auguest 5. WilliamBross Lloyd, millionaire Socialist;and nineteen other members of theCommunist Labor party, haVebeen found guilty by a juryof conspiracy to overthrow the government of the United States.Lloyd was given a sentence offrom one .to five years in the penitentiary and a fine of $2,000. Theother nineteen defendants receivedsentences ranging from a year in jailto five years in the penitentiary. Afew received fines in addition.The sentences are for the statepenitentiary and the Cook Countyjail.The defendants were charged withconspiracy to advocate the overthrowing of the government byforce; conspiracy to publish or distribute printed matter advocatingoverthrowing the government byforce; conspiracy to belong to an organization advocating it, and conspiracy to attend meetings at whichoverthrowing the government byforce was advocated.A motion for a new trial was madeby the defense, and the court willhear the motion September 25.Maclay Hoyne, state's attorney ina statement issued after the verdict,called it a "signal victory- for the entire United States.""In this trial Red radicalism wasdriven into the open," said the statement. "One important issue decided bythis jury is that the red card of theI. W. W. is international and notAmerican, and that the only cardrecognized as American is the card ofthe American working man in theAmerican Federation of Labor."The defendants were indicted under a new Illinois law against criminal syndicalism. They were amongthree hundred suspected radicalstaken in a raid in Chicago by State'sAttorney Maclay Hoyne last January,which was made the night precedingthe nationwide raid, instituted byAttorney General A. Mitchell Palm-,er.The trial began on May 10, andnearly nine weeks were consumed inelecting a jury.The state centered its attack onLloyd the most prominent of the defendants and the son of a Bostonphilanthropist. He was charged withopenly advocating a revolution of themasses against the government andwas alleged to have said in speechesthat "banks should be blown open toget money to finance the revolutionand armories should be rifled forammunition."Several newspapermen who reported speeches made by Lloyd wereamong the witnesses against the millionaire and his associates andMayor Ole Hansen, of Seattle, alsotestified. Masses of documents issued by the Third Internationale atMoscow, the Industrial Workers ofthe World and similar organisationswere introduced as evidence.The defendants' chief defense wasthat "they were exercising the rightof free speech," when making thevarious alleged seditious statementsand that they had in no way violatedtheir rights "as citizens of a free republic." Three women, indicted at thesame time as Lloyd and the othersnow are awaiting a separate trial.They are Margaret Prevev, of Akron,Ohio; Helen Judd, of Chicago, andClara Rcfsky, of Chicago.For SaleA spring wagon, in good condition.
