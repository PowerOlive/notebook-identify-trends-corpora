A dispatch from Cincinnati says:
"Miss Myrtle Wat kins, a young girl
from Cynlhiana, Ky., won the lenien
cy of the Police Court in Cincinnati
today by her tears and her request
that she ba allowed by Judge Bode to
take her child to her Kentucky home
to live. The child was abrndoned by
the mother when she was discharged
from a hospital in Cincinnati.
She returned here last week and told
the court officials that she had meant
to return for the babe. Today she
stood before Judge Bode and told him
that the child's father had promised to
marry her and care for her as soon as
he could find work. The judge took
compassion upon her and took the case
under advisement until March 13. In
the meantime he will have a letter
written to Cynthiana to learn if the
father really intends to marry her."

Mixtures made in imitation of baking powders, but containing alum,
are frequently distributed from door to door, or given away in grocery
stores. Such mixtures are dangerous to use in food. In England,
France, Germany and some sections of the United States their sale is
prohibited by law. Alum is a dangerous mineral acid, and all
physicians condemn baking powders containing it.
