accomplishedby that portion of the populationwhose skin contains the greateramount of coloring pigment BookerT Washington who may at the present time be regarded as their representative man although there are manyothers as able but not so well knownbelieves that while holding firmly andsecurely to everything guaranteed bythe constitution of the United Statesor that is fundamental to citizenshipthe colored people should make everyeffort possible to secure the friendshipconfidence and cooperation of theirwhite neighbors in the south Theyshould not be trucklers but act firmly rom principle and gain and retainrespect They should endeavor to obtain the friendly interest of the southern white man thus inducing him tohelp make laws that will in the truestsense elevate the negro He advisesthe latter to do more and more of hisown thinking and in a modest temperate manner exercise his political rightsinstead of being led by political bossesor demagogues Mr Washington further believes that a permanent cure forof our present evils will cometo both races This will cut off a Largenumber of ignorant voters now provingsuch a demoralizing factor in politicsBut through the industrial development of the negro the greatest resultswill comeEducation along this line will makehim an intelligent producer ofcould learn and work their own wayhe walked and worked his passage tothat point where he found himself surrounded by an atmosphere of businessChristian influences and a spirit of selfhelp that awakened every latent faculty and brought a realization of whatit meant to be a man instead of a pieceof transferable property On finishinghis school course in 1881 he began atTuskegee Ala what he intends to behis life work Without a dollar in achurch and small shanty with oneteacher and 30 pupils he established aschool which with its spirit of workand industrial thrift aided by the stateand by some people of the north hasdeveloped into an institution of 1000students 81

a dirt floor breathing afervent prayer to heaven that MasaiLincoln might succeed and that someday she and I might be free Afterthe close of the war Booker Washington went with his brothers to West Virginia where they worked in the coalmines for pay in money One day onseeing a negro laboriously spelling outi newspaper paragraph to a group ofcolored people who gazed at him withopen mouthed wonder

chipped andcracked in many places clearly the CasinoBaglioni needed repairs At the end of theball was a spiral staircase whose stonesteps worn to a hollow in the middle by thepassing and repassing of feet marked itsgreat age Up this narrow stairway I followed the man until we reached a corridorhung on each side with rusty suits of armor and old and tattered banners Theplace was very damp and there was a mustysmell about it as if no pure air ever camethat way ll was evident that the cavaiierewas on the alert for a man was on guardhere armed like those below with swordand arquebus To him my guide

scratching at the wood No answer however came to the knockKnock again 1 said a little impatiently and this time a deep voice called outEnter1 placed my hand on the door to open itwhen the sentry spoke with unexpected civility1Take care of the beast signoreThe beast what beast 1 asked pretending not to know anything of Plutos ex-istenceHis excellencys bear do not fear itelse it might injure you

tinkling of shivered glass andthe bear dropping on its fore feet shambledback into the room 1 was considerably6tartled and not a little angry but concealing these feelings stepped boldly into theroom keeping my drawn sword still in myhandThe Cavaiiere di Baglioni I inquiredAt the Cavaiiere di Savellis serviceand a tall figure rose from a lounge chairand surveyed me 1 confess that my heartbegan to beat a little fast when 1 saw theman against whom I was to pit myself Hewas far above the middle height and proportionately broad His grizzled hair parted in the middle hung down straightly tohis neck and a thick gray heard and mustache bid his mouth and chin A cruelhooked nose almost Hebraic in shape wasset between a pair of small and piercingeyes lis complexion was deathly pale andby tli light which fell from the barred window 1 saw beneath the skin the little redbnes ol swollen veins which marked an intemperate life At a small table beside thehair was a pack of cards and a is halffilled with red wine the bottle from whichthe wine was taken was lying in fragmentsat the door where it had fallen and 1 rokento bits aft r being flung at Pluto The bearwas now beside bis master facing me hishuge he 1 hed down and swaying from sideto side We remained for half a minutestaring at each other and then Baglionispoke again with his deep Bneering accentIs it usual for the Cavaiiere di Savelli topay visits with a drawn sword in his handIs it usual 1 replied for gentlemen tobe receive i by having a savage beast set atthemOh Pluto and lie touched the bearPluto was t set at you man you won

you canput back your sword It would avail youlittle he grinnedit cost me an effort but 1 did as I wasbidden and Baglioni sank back into hislounge the bear still standing and keepingits fierce eyes on me Its master howeverkept ru Ins hand up and down itsBhaggy coat whilst he asked in his measuredvoiceWell and to what do I owe the honor ofthis visitYou would prefer no beating about thebushIt is my wayWell then cavaiore I have come fie 1 spcei bject and that is toask you to change sides aid to use your inflm nee with your cousin Count Carlo to dolikewisei follow the head of my boutExactly You are aware that His Holiness - over 70 years of agehe laud bin 01 Cod AlexandWell he cannot go on forever and if hewere to die it is an end to thelie Iio he laughed it is an end tothe Borgia Cavaiiere

for a low bornbastard eh Ho ho break Cesare NotyouStronger trees have fallen signore remember we have France and the Florentines on our side and g0 under Trelille and Trevulzio are not 20 miles fromyoui was playing a risky game If I did succeed in inducing this man to listen to myproposals and he actually persuaded hiscousin to do likewise it would be a terribleblow to the Borgia On the other hand iran the immediate 1 tsk of being arrested andkept a prisoner or killed outright But itwas the only way to gain time and lookabout me and whilst U ivelystroked his strange pet making no reply tomy last speech I glanced cautiously butcarefully around the room Like the passageoutside the wall- were hung with old armorand old flags Time had defaced the pictures on the ceiling and such furniture asthere was was old and the coverings of thechairs ind tables moth eaten and winestained The stale odor of wine mingledwith the must of a long untouched room andeverywhere on the tables on the chairsand strewn here and there on the floor werecards Evidently the cavaiiere had a weakness in this direction and like lightning itflashed upon me t hat if he were a gamblerthe game was probably in my hands and 1would drop policy and turn to the cardsIy thoughts were interrupted by Laglioniwho broke the silence What evidencehave you to show you are the person yourepresent yourself to be1 can offer you none In matters likethese one does not carry evidence aboutbut if you like to send a trusted messengerto Rome to the Cardinal d Amboise seethereception he will get or nearer still to TremouilleAnd why come to meBecause of your influence with yourcousin and because you are a man who willplay for a big stake and 1 risked the shotHis eyes flashed and his hand stopped in itsmovement through the fur of the bearMy influence with my cousin is thathe snapped his fingers but a big stakeyes 1 like playing for big stakesI stooped and picked up a card holdingit idly up between my finger and thumbThis what I propose is a bigger stakethan you could ever get on the king cavaiiere and with a twist of my wrist 1 sentthe card from me it hit the wall oppositewith a smart tap and then floated slowlyand noiselessly down to the floor of theroomThe mans eyes followed the card and hemuttered as if to himselfA big stake yes Carlo gives me nothingI am his jailer I who in a single nighthave lost two lordships to Riar have nownot a ducat to iling in the air except whatthe niggard allows me1 did not like the part I was playing butI knew enough of the state of affairs to becertain that D Amboise would richly rewardthe person who could detach Baglioni fromthe Borgia I said no more than the truththerefore -when I added quietlyYou would have another lordship or twomavbe to stake if my proposal were carriedoutCospetto he said it is uselessThen I am sorry 1 replied rising as ifto depart but must wish you good dayDiavolo Cavaiiere you are not goingwithout some refreshment Ho withoutthere and his deep voice pealed out like agreat bellThe bear which had stretched itself onthe floor rose with a grunt but Baglionipressed its head down and it sank back andbegan to hum itself between its paws likean enormous bee or rather with the sounda thousand bees might makeAfter a little delay there was a knock atthe door but apparently as usual the person outside whoever he was did not feeldisposed to come in My host rose in angerand stepped across the room followed byhis beast the latter passing unpleasantlyclose to meThere was an altercation at the door myhost went out with his pet and for a minute or two I was left alone 1 moved myseat nearer to the small table beside Baglionis lounge and taking up the pack ofcards began to shuffle and cut themThe cavaiiere came back very soon a flaskin one hand and a glass in the otherBlood of St John he exclaimed as heset them down with a clink on the tablethose rascals 1 will have their ears cutoff they fear this poor lamb and hefondled the great bear which rose on itshind feet and began muzzling its master1 am not surprised Corpo di BaccoThe king again and I flung down the packin apparent disgustDown Pluto and Baglioni

heavier the purse thebetter for meA favoi I cannot play with that beastnear me could you not send him awaySend him away my familiar he saidwith an awful smile Xo ro Di Savellibe is my luck but 1 shall

strike the moment he heardmy whistle When I came back 1 was relieved to find the bear fastened by a chainto a ring in the wall The chain itself wasweak and could have been snipped withease but the animal made no effort to strainat it and lay down as contentedly as a dogBaglioni bad pulled a table into the centerof the room and was seated at it impatientlyruffling the cardsBack at last be said

not a very formidable foeIn a few steps we reached the door howanted and Baglioni after knocking oncesimply turned the key and pushed open thedoorLooking over his shoulder I saw a smallbut well furnished room and standing in themiddle of it in startled surprise at this sudden intrusion the figure of Angiola Quickas thought I made a warning gesture andalmost at the moment Baglioni turned

SeedThe prevalence of yellows amongpeaches makes their propagation bybudding a danger in spreading the disease It is in the sap and if any treewhich the knife cuts into to make aplace for the bud is affected with yellows the taint will be retained by theknife and spread the yellows to all thetrees inoculated It is quite easy to besure that a rich luscious peach is notaffected with yellows especially ifgathered from the tree The pit fromsuch a peach ought to produce a valuable seedling and free from disease Thelow repute of seedling peaches datesfrom the time when the natural frnilwas about the only kind grown Puteven then some valuable seedlings werefound in every seedling producedAmerican CultivatorThe Feed anil tle CowsThere is considerable in a cows possibility to give a good quality of richmilk but it is easy to have that possibility ruined by poor feed and care inbringing up and developing On theother band no amount of food and carewill induce a cow that gives thin poormilk to turn about and give milk whichis rich in solids Good feed and goodcare will help develop many cows thathave been neglected but if there is anydecided improvement it will be madewith cows that are born to be gocdbut have not had the opportunity Toget the most out of any cow good orbad good feed and care are necessarybut it lo the good cow that gives thebest returns when well fed and
