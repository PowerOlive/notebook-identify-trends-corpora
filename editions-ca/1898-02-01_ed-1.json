SHORT WORDS
Slitey Are tlie Best When the Thought
Are Worth While
A dozen or less newspaper men were
collected together when somebody said
somefckiettf abont Rudyard Kipling
1 notice in the papers said an
other that he is the best paid writer
in the world at present
The Pall Mall Gazette people say
they paid him 750 a poem for all they
printed of his ventured a third
And why not put in a fourth
He is the best writer of English prose
or verse sow writing That one line of
his A rag and a bone and a hank of
hair describing a vampire woman
couldnt be stronger I think
Good and strong commented a
fifth but Kipling is not the only man
who has chosen monosyllables to give
emphatio expression to his thought If
you will remember Pope in his essay
on Criticism remarked And ten low
words oft creep in one dull line and
before and after him there were others
who as he were scaroely dull and sel
dom crept Hymn writers are strong in
this Take Watts in that well known
hymn for instance
Are there no foes for me to face
Must I not stem the flood
Is this vile world a friend to grace
To help me on to God
Shakespeare found one syllabled
words good enough for him and you all
know that passage of Youngs
The bell strikes one We take no note of time
gave by its loss etc
Baileys Testus that makes its
reader feel as if he had eaten of the in
sane root that takes the reason prisoner
has many examples and this one you
will recall
We live in deeds not years in thoughts not
breaths
We should count time by heart throbs Hev
most lives
Who thinks most feels the noblest acts the
best
And the Bible the greatest of books
m filled with the short words Right at
the beginning of things we find And
God said let there be light and there
was Jight and at the end of things so
to speak For the great day of his wrath
iscome and who shall be able to stand
and still further along And the gates
of it shall not be shut at all by day for
there stall be no night there
Oh Kipling is all right He knows
he has plenty of authority for seeking
short words When he wants strong
ones Washington Star
A DARKYS PRIZE MENU
But1 His F lends Werent Betting Against
a Sure Thing
Three negroes not long ago made a
bet among themselves that each could
name a supper that would be better than
the others could name They put up 1

dishes that would constitute the best
supper should take the 3 They drew
straws as to which ones should be the
first and the last to make up the menu
