Cassius M. Clay, .of Bourboncounty, were passed at a meeting .ofthe Board held in Lexington Tuesday. It is with sincere regret that theBoard of Trustees" of the State University of Kentucky, record the severance of their official relations withHon. Cassius M. Clay by his voluntary resignation of the office of Trustee which lie held by appointment fornearly twelve consecutive years. Hiseminent ability, his fine education,broad, liberal thought; his high character for honor and integrity, himdistinguished reputation for patriotism and practical statesmanship, andhis unswerving loyalty to the best interests of the Commonwealth, allcombine to make him a Kentuckianand an American of the highest type.During his long connection with theBoard of Trustees, Mr. Clay gave dignity and prestige to its proceedings,Hils straightforwardness, his manliness, his well defined opinions uponorganization and policy, his utter impartiality and the energy and earnestness and intelligent breadth of graspwith, which he expressed his convictions never failed to make a deep impression on his colleagues. By all liesaid and did the conviction was bornein upon all, here is p, just man and agreat -man in whom justice and truthi are me impelling anu controlling elements of Iris being.During the forty-eight years of itsexistence, the State College, now theState University of Kentucky, had nomore distinguished director of its organization and management, no morescolarl guide in framing and conordinating its policies, and no moreimpartial arbiter in difference whichemerged in relation to its activitiesand control.The untimely death of this distinguished man a'dds poignancy to theregret felt because of his voluntaryseverance of his relations with us.Not the State University only but hisState and the Nation are distinctlypoorer today because of the passingof such a .man. In the language of theLatin poet whom he loved so well,"Quis desiderio sit 'pudor aut modusTarn cari capitis."When jVIilton bewailed the untimelydeath of Lycidas, Lycidas was young,Mr. Clay, though somewhat advancedin years,was young in spirit, full ofintellectual vitality and vigor, in fullaccord with all his"-efforts to advanceand elevate mankind. In him wasyouth matured by experience, butj youth still. With equal sorow and re-gret we may paraphrase the languagetof Milton:i"Lycidas is dead, dead while in hisprime,Who would not 'mourn' for Lycidas?"DEAFNESS CANNOT BE CUREDHas Giver Away Near '$400,000,000,Keepi"g Only $25,000,000 ForI Change.Andrew Carnegie and poverty areterms that it would seem could hardly be used in a co-relative sense.And yet the famous ironmaster is,comparatively speaking, a poor man.lCarnegie s passion for philanthropyhas brought his immense fortunedown withn striking distance of thei$25,000,000 mark.Carnegie, it was learned recently,!hag given away nearly all his millionsupon millions "pf United States SteelCorporation bonds.

There is only one way to curedeafness, and that is by constitutional remedies. Deafness is nearly,always caused by an inflamed condition of the mucous lining of the Eustachian' tube. When this tube is inflamed you have a rumpling sound opimpaired hearing, and when it is entirely closed, deafness is the result,and unless the inflammation be taken out and "this tube restored to itsnormal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever; nine cases out often are caused by Catarrh, which isnothing but an inflamed condition ofthe mucous surfaces.We will give One Hundred yDollars for any case of deafness (causedby catarrh) that cannot be cured byHall's Catarrh Cure.

Thecatarrh wasjso severe inJhis easelthat his lifeseemedthreaterled.As he expresses ithimself, hehad "onefoot in thegrave."Of coursehe tried toget relief.Many practition erswere ' consulted and acatarrhspecialist inSt. Louis was tried. He got so weakand thoroughly run down that he declares he could not walk more than,a hundred yards without resting.Few people understand that catarrh,is a constant drain on the system.The discharge of mucus which,, togoing on- in such cases is largely composed of blood serum, and is a greatwaste. Sooner or later it will weaken,the strongest man.According to VcDorts received from.I Mr. Johnson, he was in a desperatecondition, out ne round relief, from,his trouble.

Thebeautiful sentiment expressed in the celebration of this day enters intoall our hearts. Peace and Good Will are not idle words to be idly spoken.Let our hearts utter them as well as our tongues, with a full understandingof what they mean, and a determined effort to convey that understanding inevery sense of the word, and the resultant happiness will well repay the effort.A pleasure shared is a pleasure multiplied, and a kindly word is a seed thatproduces a plant prolific. May the spirit of Christmas be with you and fillyour cup of happiness to the brim.For some little time Santa Claus has been receiving letters from childrenall over the land. These sacred little epi.tles of love and confidence shouldbe encouraged. They typify the childish idea of Santa Claus as a sort of asuperior being, lovingly listening to their little appeals and granting themwhen possible. There is nothing that tends stronger towards the uplift ofboth children and older folks than devotion to an ideal.The splendid work which this magazine section is accomplishing is illustrated by the following letter which has been received from Mr. John W. Newman, Commissioner of Agriculture of the State of Kentucky. Mr. Newmanhas made the uplift of agriculture his life work, and the results of his effortshave proved of the greatest possible benefit to the agricultural community.DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURELabor and StatisticsFRANKFORT. KENTUCKYJ. W. NEWMAN.Mr. A. Bart Horton,Cincinnati, Ohio.My Dear Sir: In reply to yours of November 10. permit me to say that I am very muchpleased with the magazine section that you are issuing as a supplement for the countryweekly papers. This publication i3 attractively printed and the subject matter that it contains is such as will be of material aid to those farmers who read it. Let me urge you tomake of this section practically an up-to-date farm monthly. Nothing could be of morevalue to the readers of the average weekly newspaper, and I believe such a magazine asthis to be of more interest to them than a lot of detective stories, "Sketches from Barneo,"and other useless reading matter that is often found in the magazine sections of newspapers.In other words, you are on the right track, and if you would develop this maga7ine intoa great supplement principally devoted to farm matters. I am sure you will have the heartysupport of the country newspapers, as it will be appreciated by their readers. So heartilydo I believe in this that from time to time I will contribute such matter as is within mypower to prepare, free of cost, in order to help the good work along.Wishing you every success, I beg to remain.Very truly yours.J.

NEWMAN, Commissioner of Agriculture.Would $35.00 Per Week Interest You?Would you like to be engaged in a business, inwhich you could not only make the above sum, or more,if the proper time and energy were devoted to the work,but in which you would be your own boss and could bethe sole judge as to how your time could be employedmost efficiently?We want agents in your locality to represent theoldest Kentucky Old Line Life Insurance Company,which has more than fifty thousand policyholders inthis State alone, and we have Supervisors who willinstruct you in the work free of charge.

Y.iTHE MONTHLY MAGAZINEChristmas at Pleasant ValleyA Homely Story of a Family of Five HundredBy A. Bart HortonPLEASANT VALLEY was in a state of excitement. Christmas Day was the day ofall days in the little town and this was anunusual -Christmas Day. Long years ago thepowers that ruled over the destinies of PleasantValley decreed that Christmas should be celebrated by the town as one large family, and thiscustom had been followed by father and son,mother and daughter to the present day. In thepioneer days of the state, when the chief pleasureof the Indians, resenting the intrusion of thewhite settler, had been to kill and slay, it hadhappened that the little band of settlers of Pleasant Valley had been threatenedby a band of Indians. Tortureand death seemed imminent onthe dawn of Christmas Day. butrelief came unexpectedly andprovidentially. Since then, eachChristmas Day, the entire community gathered at one place,and these gatherings, growingas the town grew, took on newpleasures and devised new plansfor the celebration. The spiritof Christmas spread throughoutthe year and the spirit of peaceand good will prevailed universally. In short Pleasant Valley was about the happiest littlecommunity in the United States.Of course, it had its sicknessand death and resultant sorrows, but Doctor Johnson wasits refuge in these cases. It hadoccasionally its little tiffs, butJudge Johnson settled them andappeal from his decision was anunheard of proceeding. Sometimes there was want and Farmer Johnson was then usuallycalled on.The Johnsons were descendants of three of that little pioneer band and Dame Fortunehad dealt kindly with them inmany ways. Their farms werelarge and prosperous, but theirfortunes were no larger thantheir hearts, and one of themwas always on the "Christmas Commission" atPleasant Valley. Every year at the celebration amember of this commission was elected to servefor a term of three years, and no member couldbe elected more than once during that period.Thus new ideas and different plans were devisedeach year, but there was always the big dinnerin Farmer Johnson's big barn, and the big Christmas tree, with gifts for every one of the fivehundred, big and little, rich and poor who livedin Pleasant Valley, and though these were theprincipal features of the day there were indoorand outdoor athletic events, and speaking andmusic, good and bad, and a big dance in theevening winding up with a Virginia Reel. Theturkeys and little roast pigs that were grownespecially for the occasion, and the pies an'dother good things for the dinner were preparedwith the utmost care, and nobody was allowedto tell who contributed this or that to the feast.The "Christmas Commission" was by far themost important official body at Pleasant Valley,and for many months previous to that day theywere making preparations. Children broughtthem pennies, older people saved a little here andthere and sent them the savings and the wealthierresidents contributed large sized sums, and no onebut the commission knew what anyone gave.This particular year there was an unusual gift tobe given and there was just enough mystery inconnection with it to excite all Pleasant Valley.Every one who could be depended upon knewthat Farmer Johnson was to be the recipient,excepting Farmer Johnson, who thought it wasfor someone else. Several years before an agri-n j vcultural expert had been employed to give thecommunity the benefit of his knowledge. The result of his effort proved so largely beneficial thatevery one felt grateful and the expert himselfdelighted with the people and their methods, haddetermined to make himself one of them and hadpurchased a farm as near to them as he couldget. He and Farmer Johnson had gone up tothe State Fair a few months before and returnedenthused over the merits of a young Jerseybull. Then and there some of the leaders determined that this was an opportunity for them toshow in a measure the love and gratitude of thecommunity for the Good Farmer. So the matterwas taken up with the "commission" who weredelighted with the idea and the bull was boughtforthwith. Everybody gladly contributed to thespecial fund raised for the purchase, even FarmerJohnson himself, for when the "commission" calledon him, he was informed that it was to be presented to the Agricultural Expert, "Certainly,Gentlemen. I will gladly contribute for he hasdone us lots of good, and that is a present fitfor a king, for that bull is a wonder." So theFarmer wrote them a good sized check whichthe commission pocketed with sly winks at eachother and many indications of suppressed smiles.Then to further the innocent deception they selected Farmer Johnson to make the presentationspeech, and he accepted the honor with intensepleasure. It was his chief delight to make aspeech. He was a good talker and he knew it,and furthermore wanted everybody else to knowit. An event of this kind with the sentimentalways surrounding Christmas gave him a splendid opportunity for the displayof his silver tongue, and he setabout preparing the speech ofhis life.Christmas Day dawned brightand beautiful at Pleasant Valley. The white blanket of snowspreading to the slopes of thedistant hills, glistened in thesunlight. At Farmer Johnson'shouse there was the usual celebration. All the members ofthe family gathered at the headof the stairs and Farmer Johnson with his youngest daughter,a fair haired tot of three, on hisback led the procession downstairs and into the big parlor,where stood the Christmas treewonderfully decorated and surrounded in the room by thepresents of the family. How allthe Johnsons, big and littleloved that ceremony, how thelittle ones arose early and sawthat every one else arose early,how they hastily dressed andanxiously awaited the appearance of their father and mother,and how they each sought theirown iittle pile of gifts and expressed their pleasure and appreciation. It made indeedworth while all the trouble andwork done by the Good Farmerand his wife. At the breakfasttable, Tom Johnson, the eldestboy, home Lorn college for the holidays, saidto his father. "How's the speech, Father?""Ask your mother, my boy," and his eyes shonewith the anticipated pleasure before him. AndMother Johnson, to whom it had frequently beenrehearsed, and who knew of her good husband'sweakness, answered, "It's splendid, son, the bestI ever heard." The Farmer looked at her lovingly, "And don't you except one, my dear, oneI made to you in the long ago?" And she answered him, "That was not a speech; that wassacred music." After breakfast the Johnsonhousehold got busy, for soon the corps of helpersengaged from a nearby city would arrive, andfarmers, and farmers' wives and farmers' childrenwould drive in from the outlying farms in Pleasant Valley. Their own big kitchen was muchtoo small for this occasion, and out in one endof the big barn a kitchen had been constructedlong ago for these occasions.At half past ten the athletic events startedContinued on page 12.)THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEMenus and Hints for the Christmas DinnerAs the dinner plays the most important part in the celebration of that feast of all feasts CHRISTMAS these few suggestionsand recipes might help the housewife solve the dinner problemIt should not be overlooked that the attractiveness of the table adds to the enjoyments of the dinner.

Bryant, Supt.EDITOR'S NOTE This is the fourth of a series of articles onThe Kentucky Agricultural Experiment Station and Its "Work.GREAT efforts are beingmade by the differentstates in the eradicationof hog cholera. Kentucky's annual loss from this disease hasbeen between one and two million dollars in recent years.Every state of any consequencein swine production now has astate laboratory for the production of anti-hogcholera serum. Just a few years ago the UnitedStates Bureau of Animal Industry invited theExperiment Station authorities of the variousstates to visit the government laboratory atAmes, Iowa; first, for the purpose of familiarizing the state authorities with this new discovery, and indirectly to have them go beforethe legislature of their respective states in behalfof the swine industry. Their policy was right.It was not long before the principal hog raisingstates were dispensing this protective serum. Theevolution and growth of some of these laboratories have been remarkable.Anti-hog cholera serum is the defibrinatedblood or blood-serum obtained from immune hogshighly immunized against the disease by repeatedinjections of hog cholera virus. The blood isdrawn from the tails of hyperimmune hogs under as nearly perfect aseptic conditions as possible, defibrinated and placed in sterile bottles.It is then immediately put in a large refrigeratorwhere it is kept until tested, and expressed toparties desiring it. Drs. Dorset and Niles areresponsible for the discovery of this serum. Itis called the Dorset-Niles Anti-Hog CholeraSerum.PROGRESS OF THE WORK IN KENTUCKYIn 1910 the Legislature of Kentucky appropriated $2,000 for the production of anti-hogcholera serum. This money was expended inerecting a small frame laboratory, and the workof producing serum to combat hog cholera inKentucky was started in this building with fiveProgress of Hog Cholera SerumWork in KentuckyRobt.

The production of serum is governed bythe rules and regulations of theBureau of Animal Industry.METHOD OF VACCINATING HOGSQuarters of Hyperimmunized Hogs, with a Capacityof 300 Hyperimmune HogsTesting for Tuberculosis Before Using Hogs for SerumProduction. All Tubercular Hogs are by thisMethod Eliminatedhyperimmune hogs. In a short time the demandsfor serum from farmers over the State increasedbeyond the capacity of this meagrely equippedbuilding, and in 1912 an additional appropriationwas made, which resulted in the erection of anew and modern laboratory at a cost of $11,000.This laboratory, which should meet the demandsof Kentucky swine raisers, has a capacity of300,000 cubic centimeters of anti-hog choleraserum per week, or a sufficient amount of serumto inoculate 15,000 forty pound pigs. We mightsay the insurance of $75,000 worth of healthyporkers at a nominal cost of $2,000 to the farmers. Farmers pay the cost of production for theserum, i. e., one cent per cubic centimeter.The new laboratory proper is so arranged andequipped that all serum is handled in one roomin separate containers from that of the virus,and every possible equipment has been installedto prepare a highly potent serum. With such alaboratory, and the cooperation of the veterinarians, Kentucky should make a good record inhandling this problem. The administration of theserum is confined to graduate veterinarians andto those nongraduate men who prove efficientin this work. Only experts are allowed toThere are three methods ofvaccinating hogs, namely: (a)The Serum Alone Method, (b) The Serum Simultaneous Method, (c) The Combination Method.SERUM ALONE METHODAs the name suggests, this method consists ininjecting serum alone into the animal at pointspreviously indicated. Hog cholera can not possibly be introduced or transmitted by serumalone. This method immunizes hogs from a fewweeks to two months.SERUM SIMULTANEOUS METHODThis method consists in injecting the sameamount of serum as recommended in the serumalone method, but in addition a small amount ofhog cholera virus (blood of a hog suffering fromcholera), is injected, before the hog is released,in the opposite thigh or opposite side of theneck from which the serum was injected. Severetransitory effects may follow the use of thismethod and occasionally a very susceptible pigdevelops the disease from the inoculation anddies. The average loss is about one or twopercent. Hogs vaccinated by this method areimmune to the disease of cholera from sixmonths to life; usually for life.THE COMBINATION METHODThe Combination Method consists in first using the serum alone, followed by the injectionof serum and virus in ten or twelve days. Thismethod has the advantage of preparing the animal for the serum-simultaneous treatment, andpractically removes all danger of loss followingthe serum simultaneous treatment. It should beused especially in valuable herds where the lossI lull Sf Hvl IhIUIlfr Pits' i H B !B.

Showing "Turkey Egg"Appearance.of one or two animals would more than pay theentire cost of the vaccination.HOW TO DETERMINE THE METHOD TOUSE IN VACCINATING A HERDThe method to be emplo3red in vaccinating aherd is, at times, no easy matter to determine.The following mode of procedure will aid theveterinarian and farmer in reaching a decision.First, a complete history of the herd should beobtained. This history should consist in determining first of all if the herd is diseased or ifany of the animals on the place have died andfrom what cause; the prevalence of hog choleraon adjoining farms or in the immediate vicinity,and the time which has elapsed since the lastout-break of hog cholera on the premises. Thehistory of all newly purchased hogs should alsobe obtained.Before a method of vaccination is decidedupon it should be ascertained beyond a doubtwhether or not the sick animals in the herdare suffering from cholera. In order to do this,the temperature of a sick hog should be taken,after which he should be killedand a post-mortem examinationmade. If sufficient lesions arenot found for diagnostic purposes in the first post-mortem,other sick animals should bekilled and subjected to postmortem examination so that theoperator may determine whether the disease is or is not cholera. No one should attempt tovaccinate hogs until he is qualified to definitely diagnose hogcholera from the symptoms andthe post-mortem lesions. Animals that have died are notgood subjects for post-mortemsas there is danger of the operator contracting blood poisoning through abrasions in theskin of the hands, and, moreover, the natural color of theorgans is soon altered afterdeath.It may or may not be profitable to vaccinate hogs in a herdaffected with cholera. The serum is a preventive and not acure, and if all or the greaternumber of hogs in the herdshow visible symptoms of thedisease of cholera, it is uselessto vaccinate. However, if thedisease has just started, a goodly number of the hogs showingno visible symptoms of cholera may be saved.In such a herd the serum-alone method shouldbe used and all the inoculated animals allowedto run on the infected ground. By this method,those hogs that have not already picked upsome of the infection in the natural way, areliable to do so later. This will result in moreor less permanent immunity. In other words,the result will practically be the same as ifhealthy hogs had received the serum-simultaneousinoculation. The temperature of each animal should be taken and recorded. Some animals may appear to be in a perfectly healthycondition, and yet may be incubating the disease.Such animals may show temperature far abovenormal, however, often as high as 108 degrees F.Animals showing a temperature of 105 degreesor lower, may be saved sometimes by the useof serum alone in infected herds. There may beeven some chance of saving those showing highertemperatures provided there are no visiblesymptoms of the disease.

In young hogs a temperature of over 103.5 degreesF., or over 103 degrees F. inmature hogs, indicates fever, especially so, if the history of theherd indicates infection withcholera. If an apparentlyhealthy herd is located near aninfected herd of hogs, the simultaneous method may be used.No one but an expert, however,should attempt this method ofvaccination. Great care must beexercised by the operator in determining that the disease is notalready in the herd, in the incubation stage. If it is present,no virus should be used, for ifemployed, it would simply addto the infection already presentand result in the loss of animals.The simultaneous treatment canbe given to animals in such aherd showing no clinical symptoms of the disease and not registering a temperature over 103degrees F. for mature animalsand 103.5 degrees F. for pigsand shoats. Individuals havingtemperatures higher than thisshould be given serum alone.If the weather is warm, thework should be done early inthe forenoon and late in theafternoon.THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEThe serum-alone method should be employedon all recently infected farms or on farms thathave had more or less permanent infection foryears. All young pigs should be given serumalone before they are ten days old, and a secondinjection of serum alone on or about weaningtime.Sows that are suckling pigs should never begiven the serum simultaneous treatment, butboth sow and pigs should be given serum alone.After the pigs are weaned, the sows and pigsmay be given the simultaneous treatment provided they all look healthy and show normaltemperatures.The serum alone method should be employedon animals that are about to be shipped on a showcircuit. If the circuit extends over a few weeks,it might be well to re-inoculate such a herdfour or five weeks after the first inoculation.Pigs from dams that have been immunized bythe serum-simultaneous method before beingbred, may be given serum and virus when theyare from ten days to three weeks old. Such pigsderive considerable immunity from their damsuntil they are of this age, and hence stand thesimultaneous treatment well. To secure permanent immunity, they should again be vaccinatedby the serum-simultaneous method when theyare weaned. It should be borne in mind, however, that pigs from immune dams and immunesires are not permanently immune. The methodmentioned above is the one employed in immunizing the Experiment Station pigs and hasbeen successful so far. The premises on whichthese pigs run must be considered permanently blood, used in hyperimmunization, is located oninfected, inasmuch as the building for housing the same grounds.virus pigs for the production of the cholera It is unwise in extremely warm weather toLung Showing Hemorrhages Characterise:of Hog Choleragive a healthy herd of hogs the simultaneoustreatment in a non-infected territory, simply forthe reason that one or two of the pigs may comedown with the disease and thus become a sourceof infection to neighboring farms.NEED FOR ADOPTION OF A SANITARYCODEHog cholera has cost the American farmermillions of dollars, and everything indicates thatit will continue to toll a heavy loss until everystate in the Union passes rigid sanitary lawsgoverning diseased herds and infected premises.Hogs should have clean quarters in which tosleep. The houses should be dry and well ventilated. The troughs and floors from which hogsare fed should be kept scrupulously clean anddisinfected once a week. The lack of quarantinelaws for cholera herds and premises in Kentucky allows this disease to spread rapidly. Thenegligence of owners in disposing of choleracarcasses and in properly cleaning and disinfecting cholera premises, has resulted in a widespread of the disease on farms, stock cars andon public highways. Cholera carcasses shouldbe burned or buried deeply and covered withquick lime. Burning is greatly to be preferred.Virulent outbreaks of hog cholera have developed from carcasses that have been buried forseveral years; therefore the man who buries cholera hogs on his farm is in constant danger ofhog cholera.Farmers needing serum should get in touchwith the laboratories of their respective statesand lend their efforts to ultimately eradicatethis disease.PureMilkBy R. M. AllenHead of Food and Drag Department, Kentucky Agricultural Experiment StationAN interesting, difficult, and most importantpure food question is that of pure milk.From the standpoints of anatomy, chemistry, bacteriology, preventive medicine, the practical production of milk and the making of butterand cheese have claimed the attention of a largecorps of workers and the general public. Thefirst questions inquired into were as to the anatomy and physiological formation of milk in theudder of the animal, and its chemical composition. These were studied in connection withboth man and manjr animals. The milk comesfrom the blood. A duct leads into a gland whereit divides into smaller ducts, and these into stillsmaller, until the smallest duct is reached, aroundthe end of which are clustered several pouches.Each of these pouches is lined with epitheliumcells, and in the walls of these pouches are capillary blood vessels which bring the blood nearthe cells, and thus the milk is formed.Smaller animals, such as the Jersey cow, produce milk having a larger percent of fat; largeranimals, such as the Holstein cow, or the elephant, produce milk containing less fat and morecasein and mineral salts. Fat is one of the foodswhich nature produces more abundantly againstthe rigors of cold weather. The elephant givesmilk containing less fat than does the animal inthe polar regions. It is climatic conditions andabundance or scarcity of food which influenceslarge or small types, in the same classes of animals, and such influences determine the qualityof the food which the animal supplies to itsyoung. The study of such matters has been ofgreat practical value in the selection and breeding of those dairy types which produce maximumquantities of milk of a maximum percent ofbutter fat.The long search for the actual constituents ofmilk and the work to devise methods of analysiswhich can be used by dairymen themselves constitute one of the most interesting chapters inthe science of chemistry. It was of much practical importance to know the amount of fat contained in milk, and to devise simple methods bywhich it could be determined. The chemistslearned that a certain dilution with sulphuricacid would dissolve the casein and other solids,and liberate the fat. A simple process for collecting the fat was the problem. Finally Dr.Babcock, of Wisconsin, combined the well-knownprinciple of the centrifuge on the one hand, andthe knowledge as to the action of sulphuric acidon the other, with the well-known Babcock testas the result. With this test, and the weighingof the milk, the dairyman had an easy and practical farm method for determining the value ofa cow for dairy purposes. This knowledge hasrevolutionized the dairy industry of the wholeworld.Pure food workers first applied chemistry tothe adulteration of milk. By determining thefat and the solids not fat in the milk, with respect to different breeds of cows, so as to establish a standard, they were able to know whetherthe milk in the market came up to the recognized standard. These standards, however, werenecessarily made low so as to include all breedsof animals, and resulted in probably more watering and skimming of milk than existed before thelaws were passed and the standards established.In other words, the milk trade started out toconform to the legal standards established whichwere necessarily lower than the actual standardof the dairy herds. It became evident, that themilk was modified by water, skimming, andskimmed milk to the "legal" standard, so theFood Department of the Kentucky AgriculturalExperiment Station changed methods and followed a suspicious sample through to the dairy,making a herd test, and gauging the milk soldin the market by the standard of milk from thedairyman's own herd. Comparing the conditionsfound in 1900 with the conditions found today,it will be seen that the pure food work has addedmore than twenty percent to the butter fat content of milk sold in the cities of Kentucky, and iskeeping out, annually, thousands of gallons ofwater. In money values, the work is eliminatingannually, on the most conservative estimates,more than $500,000 worth of fraud from the market milk supply. Preservatives are entirely apractice of the past.The chemical examination of milk was followed by sanitary inspections and bacteriologicalexaminations. The dairymen already knew fromexperience that clean conditions and icing wouldkeep the milk from spoiling. Some of them knewfrom use that formaldehyde could accomplish thesame results. The pure food laws took formaldehyde away from the careless and the unclean.The experts undertook to find the number and8THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEkinds of bacteria in milk and their sources. Milkfrom the teats and udders of cows was examined.There was some dispute as to whether the milkfrom the udder was or was not sterile. Finallyit was agreed, barring germs from diseased udders, that the milk comes from the udder, for allpractical purposes, in a sterile condition, and iscontaminated in the barn, by the milker, by beingplaced in unclean utensils, and so on. Agricultural bacteriologists working in the interest ofthe dairy industry, made the majority of inquiriesof this character. Prof. Russell, now director ofthe Wisconsin Experiment Station; Prof. H. W.Conn, bacteriologist of the Storrs, Conn., Station; Prof. Hunziker, of Cornell University, wereamong those who studied the bacteriologicalproblems of milk from the cow's teat throughinto the market, helped to classify several hundred kinds of bacteria, to show that clean conditions and clean production of the milk insure alow count, and that reverse conditions alwaysshow a high count.Accompanying bacteriological investigations,such men as Prof. Pearson, who started withthe Dairy Division of the United States Department of Agriculture, was later professor dairyingat Cornell University, and now president of IowaState College, made a study of the equipment andmethod necessary in the dairy for the productionof sanitary milk. Inquiries were made by the Federal Dairy Division into the market milk suppliesoi cities. Health officers, such as Dr. Woodward,of Washington, D. C, undertook systematic studies and finally, in 1906, all the experts of theFederal Government were brought together bythe United States Public Health and Marine Hospital Service to collaborate the practical andscientific facts with relation to the milk supplyand its proper control. Thus it was that a fundof accurate and important information was established which, while still leaving many importantproblems for investigation, was extensive, accurate, and practical enough to revolutionize thesanitary condition of the dairy business, when theeducational effort and enforcement of the lawshould put the information into the hands ofthe health officer, the dairymen, and the milktrade, and require every-day compliance. Theaim of the Kentucky pure food work is to obtain such results.Up until 1904, effort under the pure food lawof Kentucky was directed towards eliminatingwater, artificial coloring, skimming, and preservatives like formaldehyde and boracic acid inmilk. There were several statutes against contaminated milk, the enforcement of which wasnot lodged in any particular officials. The evilsof the slop dairy were extensive and dangerous,especially in and around Louisville. For severalyears the health officer had been fighting to havethese closed. Farm dairymen made assessmentsto help, and employed counsel, cheap swill milkbeing a competition which they could not easilymeet. The slop dairies were really for the purpose of fattening worn out and diseased cows,shipped from the farms into the stock yards, withmilk as a by-product. Cows, chained like thegoose, were fattened and milked in filth. Finallythe health officer secured indictments. A casewas taken to the Court of Appeals, and, on December 9, 1903, Chief Justice Burnam sustainedthe old statute of the State against the sale ofmilk from cows fed on slop or liquid distillerywaste. With this backing, the health departmentrenewed another year of attack. Attorneys forthe dairymen, however, raised a new point. Theycontended that the swill statute had been repealed by the later pure food act. because thelater act applied to all foods, and particularlyto the sanitary conditions of foods. The lowercourt so held. The question was, had the legislature intended by the pure food statute to repealthe protection of the former law, or had it intended to supply a new remedy in the purefood law.Physicians, consumers, and the health officerin Louisville appealed to the pure food workersat the Experiment Station, and we decided tomeet the new point which the dairymen hadraised with another point that if the legislaturehad repealed one statute, it had intended to coverthe subject in the later act. It was necessaryto reinvestigate unsanitary conditions becausethe new law would apply to the filthy conditionsand not the feeding of the slop. The dairymenclaimed that the slop could be fed without filth.Several dairies were designated for the experiment. The result continued to be unclean andunsatisfactory conditions, with which human labor could not successfully deal. The dairymenwere notified in the spring of 1906, that after thecows were sold their business must not be startedagain in the fall. The majority of the distillersfurnish slop only in the cooler seasons. Without exception, the dairymen again opened in thethe fall. Without exception they were againbrought before the magistrate. Large fines andjail sentences were imposed. The jail sentenceswere held up for several months to allow thedairymen to dispose of their property. April 1,1907, was set as the date to end slop feeding. Asthe date approached, pleas and pressure fromalmost every part of the State were brought tobear in behalf of the continuance of the practice.The county attorney, the health department, themagistrate, the committees from the consumers'clubs, the physicians, and the Louisville pressstood firm behind one standard, and swill dairying, as an established industry, was forever abolished from the State of Kentucky.We continued the sanitary inspection of dairiesout into the farm districts. Milk depots, retailers' ice boxes, shipping cans were also lookedinto, and many cases prosecuted. The sanitaryequipment and method in practically all thedairies of the State were several times surveyed.New barns, new milk houses, and awakened interest in sanitary milk production followed. Finally, the department secured funds to utilize theaccurate methods of bacteriology. A travelinglaboratory was put into the field for the purposes of showing local health departments, consumers, and dairymen themselves, just how thework was done. Once, twice, tree times themilk supply of the whole State was gathered forbacteriological investigation, and the problem ineach city studied. Some of the dairymen, withthe conservative information just published bythe bacteriologists, argued that the high countsdid not mean bad bacteria. To all present-dayworkers high counts mean careless and uncleanconditions. The task, therefore, is to convincethe dairymen; and, so, during the past two yearswe have not only been making general countsof the number of bacteria in the milk, but havealso been centering on one particular class ofbacteria, namely, those of the B. coli group, bacteria which originally come from manure. Adairyman in Lexington, supplying one of thehospitals, had a general count of 3.000,000 and50,000 bacteria of the B. coli group per teaspoonful of milk. We took the sample box outto his dairy, took samples of manure dust fromthe barn floor, washings from the cows' udders,a section of the strainer rag from the can, beingfilled in the barn, and a sample of the milk fromthe can. This showed him where the B. colibacteria came from and how these and other bacteria came into his milk, from unclean conditions during milking and the filling of the can inthe barn. He corrected conditions, put down aconcrete floor, washed the cows' udders, installed a sterilizer for utensils and used coveredpails: and his count dropped to within severalthousand, and the B. coli disappeared. This ismentioned to illustrate the particular characterof pure milk work now in progress in Kentucky.Results are necessarily slow because the force islimited. If the means were at hand to keep suchdemonstrations in progress in every dairy community throughout the State, pure and wholesomemilk, throughout, would result in but a few years.Along with such effort, the knowledge of physicians and bacteriologists that typhoid and diphtheria epidemics have been frequently due tocontaminated milk, that the rate of infant mortality is raised or lowered in proportion as themilk supply of a city is contaminated or inspected,and the certified dairy, a method established byphysicians in order to have pure milk as the bestmeans for treatment in many cases of infant intestinal diseases, have been compelling forces forpure milk. In fact, it may be said that thesecertified dairies, under commissions composed ofphysicians of exceptional ability, and wide experience in practice, have been a tremendous influence both in educating consumers and as examples, here and there, of the equipment anddairy method necessary in the production of puremilk. An able committee from the medical association at Lousville helped us in the abolishmentof the swill dairies and we, in turn, helped themin the establishment of certified dairies. Somesix or seven dairies have been in constant operation there since 1906, and, during all that time,their average result has been within the standardof ten thousand bacteria per cubic centimeter;their herds have been constantly tested for tuberculosis; their water and feed supply examined;their dairies and the health of employees constantly inspected. It was these dairymen whofinally taught us in Kentucky the practical technique of sanitary milk.The proper methods for the production of puremilk, so thoroughly demonstrated in the certifieddairies in and around Louisville have spread toother cities. In Lexington, two dairies, one withall the buildings, equipment and managementwhich money could buy; the other with a buggyshed and a log cabin cleaned up and concreted,undertook to put their milk within the certifiedstandard. The establishment of the larger dairywas interesting and important in that it broughtto the practical production of pure milk the brainsand backing of one of the nation's greatest captains of industry. If the production of puremilk can be a source of pride and pleasure toa man of such means and varied interests, itshould be of similar interest and pleasure tothe regular dairyman. The smaller dairymandemonstrated that milk of a low bacteriologicalcount is easily within the reach of every dairyfaim in Kentucky. To a cleaned-up shed andconverted cabin he added a covered pail, a simple cooler, a steam boiler, and a sterilizing cabinet. In addition, the owner of the smaller dairydid a part of the milking and thus brought tothe actual operations an interest and watchfulcare, difficult to employ. What this smaller dairyman did can be done by all.At Cornell the dairy workers studied and undertook to establish a sanitary milk supply forIthaca by applying the score card list of equipment and method for dairies. The experimentwas allowed to lapse, and, after several years,the dairies lapsed to former unsanitary conditions. A recent Cornell report points out thatpure milk will not be made practical until consumers pay the price. The other, and priorfundamental truth, however, is that consumerswill not pay the price until the pure milk hasbeen made practical and public confidence established. The trouble at Ithaca was that the workwas allowed to lapse before fixed public appreciation had been established.

A row of locusts hedged the trail,the low-hanging limbs shaded the ripening fruit.Down the path, the rustle of Polly Dean's skirtssent a covey of quail brushward."Don't let me disturb you," laughed the girl, asshe dropped her bucket with a rattle. "I comein peace; all I ask is a square deal. These berries are mine by right of discovery and ancientownership. Ned and I staked our claim yearsbefore you were born."Sinking down on an uplifted root, she pushedthe ruffled bonnet back from the face, a youngface, not from years so much as from heart andexperience the youth that wholesome environment nourishes and purifies, just as the violetthat blossoms in the shade retains its freshness,while those exposed to the sun wither and perish. Yonder, where a spring of vivid waterburst from its limestone bed, a group of highbred colts lifted their heads and whinnied inrecognition."Ned," she repeated reflectively, digging thetoe of her boot into the soft earth, "Ned. Nowonder he never took me seriously in pokeberry war-paint and chicken-feathered trousers."The girl's merrj' laugh rang out. "What a miserable little tag-cat I was in those da3rs!" shedeclared, as she rubbed the nose of a friendlycolt. "I wonder if he has ever discovered thesun does not rise because he crows? I usedto believe it did truly would have sworn itam not so sure I would not swear it now. Poorold Chanticleer! I wonder what life holds forhim? It held everything then, everything thatseemed worth while; but, now, I wonder?"A stealthy crackling of vines made the girlspring to her feet. Looking through the lowundergrowth, she saw two childish eyes, roundand solemn, fixed on her. The owner wore aglorious Carib-suit with feathered-trousers."Is these yours?" demanded the boy, as heheld two chubby fists streaming with overripeberries up for inspection. The crimson juiceflowed freely; but the boy held firmly, as if hemeant to keep his precious treasure at all hazards. "Yours, you blessed cherub, just as many asyou want.""Does they 'long to you or God?" asked theboy, solemnly.The girl caught the child in her arms andkissed the stained cheek."Everything belongs to God." she said, "everything, everything the birds, the trees, the berries, the colts, the little boys, the little girls, themama's ''"O no." cried the boy, his ej'es growing roundand wise. "Papa said the devil owns most ofthe world. He said he was taking me away fromthe devil when he brought me down here. Papasaid this was God's own country, and, if he ownsthe berries and the grass, I think it must beIn the city, where T come from, the policemansowns the grass and the market mans the berries. Papa said God owned the little boys andgirls, but he didn't say nothin' 'tall 'bout mymama."The girl looked at the child with puzzled eyes."Where did you come from, and who broughtyou?" she asked in a breath."I come from the city in a bi-plane." he saidcoolly. "Papa dropped me here and flew away.He showed me the house up yonder, and saidone of God's good angels lived there, and forme to stay there under her wing, until he camefor me. He said it might be a long, long time;but for me to stay with the angel. Does youknow the angel, and does you think she wouldmind a little boy like me?"Again, the girl caught the child in her arms,and held him close."No one would mind a little boy like you,"she cried. "But but what does your fatherknow of me?""You?" cried the boy in astonishment. "Hedon't know nothin' 'bout you! I wish't he did.Then, he might' a' left me with you. If youdon't mind, I'll stay with you, anyhow. I'skinder 'fraid uv the angel. One uv them comeone dark night and tooken my little sister away,her did, and didn't bring her back; so I'll juststay with you." He tucked his head trustinglyagainst the girl's shoulder.Polly smothered the hair back from the temples, looking deep into the eyes. "If you wantto stay with me," she said, "you will have totell me your name, your father's name, and allabout yourself.""You don't know?" he cried in surprise. "Itdon't look like you know nothin'. His nameis Pa"pa and I know him just as easy!"The girl laughed aloud in spite of complications. "I like to see you laugh," said the child. "Itmakes such a funny round hole in your face.Show it again," he demanded, as he reached upand inserted a stained forefinger in the softcheek."Listen, Cherub," said Polly, as she caught thelittle hands between her own; "what is his realname? What do others call him?"A perplexed look came into the eyes; then,the brow cleared."O, I know what you mean! They call him'Your Papa', everybody does except Mama. Shegenerally says, 'Your Father there.' "Again the dimple shone in the cheek! again,the boy cried out in delight; but the hands wereheld tightly bjr two stronger ones and could notfree themselves."You can at least tell me your name?" persisted the girl, bent on solving the mystery."You are so funny," declared the child, openlyamused. "You sure don't know nothin'. Butpshaw! you's just playing like. You called myname as soon as you seen me. Most'n everybodycalls me 'Cherub' sepin' Mama, and she callsme 'The Brat'. Papa says 'The Blessed Cherub',just like you did." He looked into her eyessolemnly for a moment; then, he asked in atone of command that reminded her vaguely ofsome one that had passed out of her life: "Whatis your name?""My name?" she repeated. "My name? JustPolly.""Poll'," he cried, his face beaming with delight. "Poll'? My sister's name was Polly.Papa called her Polly. My. but I missed herwhen she went away! She ain't been gone buta little bit. and I thought mebby Papa wuz going after her when he started up in the air."A thoughtful look came into the child's face ashe turned his eyes to the sky. "We went sofast at first." he continued, "that I thought itwouldn't take no time to catch up with her: butPapa said we just never, never could. . . .Don't you guess Papa has gone on to hunt herby hisself, and just left me here because I gotso cold and hungry?""You poor little lamb," cried the girl, catching the child up in her arms and holding himclose, "here I have kept you hungry, while Iasked questions."She bore him lightly along, her strong, youngarms flung about the baby form, her cheekpressed against his."Your mother," suggested the girl softly, "hasshe gone in search of Polly, too?""O, no!" declared the boy "she ain't got time,she's so busy with parties and things. She didn'tsee much of Polly and me. She were gone thenight Polly died. Polly got to coughing and justchoked to death. Wa'n't nobody with her sepin'me. Papa said she just flew up to God, 'causethere wan't no fit place for her to stay. Whenwe started this mornin', I asked Papa if he weregoin' to take me up to God, too; but he said:'No, I'm just going to take you away from thedevil!'"The girl's heart was beating painfully, herpulses throbbed and the blood surged throughher veins. Whose child could this be? Whywas he thrust into her arms? What a picturehe had drawn in his childish innocence! Whata mother; or could she be given the sacred name?What a soft, cuddling armful he made! Whata mere baby he was, and yet, how old! He hadtold her things, in his childish innocence ofwhich she had heard, but never believed thingsthat to a warm, wholesome nature seemed impossible. The figure relaxed and crumpled up softly onher shoulder; the berry-stained fingers loosenedtheir hold about her neck; the blackened lips,breathing softly, spoke of slumber.Through the door, swinging hospitably wide,she bore him above-stairs and laid him gentlyon her bed. She drew a chair close and heldthe little hand. What a soft, helpless, littlehand it seemed! The fingers closed over hersfirmly, and a faint smile curved the baby lips.With that smile, a fleeting memory swept thegirl. Could it be? Impossible It was simplythe feathered trousers that were the same.There was no likeness, absolutely none. Shebent forward and slipped the shoes and socksfrom the feet, the baby dimples were still abovethe toes. With impulsive maternity, she kissedthe little foot. Again, the smile curved the babylips. It was like the echo of a beloved voice.In the days that followed, there were manybattles fought in Polly's bosom. That the boywas Ned's child, she was convinced Ned, whohad dropped as completely out of her life, as ifthey lived and moved on different planets. Hehad gone his way when a mere boy, with hismoney, and the friends of his money; and shehad remained here on the old farm her fatherhad left her, with the pigs, the chickens andthe cows to her a sacred trust, and right loyally had she held it. Of the old playmate withhis well filled pockets, she never heard, but oftenwondered, wondered with a tender feeling in herheart that would not die.The first few days, she feared the father wouldnot come; then, she began t fear he would. Sheread the papers assiduously, thinking she mightsee something about the child; but nothing appeared. As time passed, as night after night sheheld the child in her arms, the fear and dreadTHE MONTHLY MAGAZINE10of separation became almost acute. What alonely life had she lived since her mother died,and how empty her arms had been! But nowshe knew the full sweetness of a dear littlenestling form how could she give him up?Sometimes, in the stillness of the night, pityfor the unknown mother would sweep over her.Then, the words of the boy would reassure her:"She's busy with parties and things." Pollywould cry out in an agony of resentment: "Sheshall not have him. He's mine, mine." Withwide eyes she would lie awake, the little warmbody pressed close, her lips against the curlyhead. How was it possible for God to makesuch a mistake? He had given the mother thechild. What was His plan? He surely had aplan. The child belonged to the mother, wasgiven to her for some purpose. What purpose?Was she a party to a crime in withholding himfrom her? Then her mood would change. Whatan unnatural mother! She should not have him!Days lengthened into weeks, weeks intomonths, but still no word, no message. Finally,one blustering autumn night Polly was startledfrom her sleep by the persistent ringing of thetelephone. She opened her eyes with a terrifyingsense of impending crisis. The little warm figurenestled close; the chubby fingers were closedfirmly on her sleeve. Lovingly, she unclaspedthe baby hand."Blessed Cherub." she whispered.From the telephone another summons camequick and imperative. As she took down the receiver, her hand shook like a palsied member.The howling of the wind, the stillness of thehouse, the darkness of the room, the lateness ofthe hour and the sudden insistent call from theouter world made every nerve tingle."Hello! Yes. . . . This is the Dean residence," she faltered. "Yes, I am Polly Dean.. . . What did you say? . . . Mother coming for child. . . . Not fit? ... I don'tunderstand. Not let her have him, did you say?Who's talking? Who? Hello! Hello! Central,give me the connection again. . . . Must havethe connection. Long Distance, put them on theline again. Why, why did you cut me off?"The girl walked the length of the room wringing her hands. What was she to do? If themother came, how could she keep the child?The message said she must not, should not, havehim. She lighted a lamp and turned it high, sothe light fell full on the child's face. Not fit.and the mother of that child? How could Godhave made such a mistake? But the voice?With a bound of the heart, Polly rememberedthe voice. It had come to her with a dear, familiar note. It was his child his. All doubtwas swept away. She dropped on her kneesbeside the bed and pressed the soft hands toher lips. She knew now why he had worn thelittle Carib-suit. Ned had remembered, as wellas she."I'll lie, I'll steal! She shall not have myCherub." she sobbed. "Save me, O God," shewhispered, "for the waters come into my soul.I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing:I am come in deep waters where the floodsovercome me."Strengthened by the brief prayer, Polly arosewith calm determination. Quietly, she lifted thechild and carried him up the narrow steps thatlead to the little garret room, where the dollsthat she had loved in her childhood still sleptin their cradles. When she came down, herarms were empty, and there were traces oftears on her white cheeks."Until I know His plan," she said. "God nevergave a mother a child without a purpose."Quickly, she made a toilet and prepared tomeet whoever might come. The old servant,she would not disturb; she had better face thisproblem alone. If sin there was, she only wouldshare it with Ned.Polly turned the light low, and sat in semidarkness, listening, listening. For a long time,there was no sound except the mourning of thewind, as if sobbing for some lost soul. Suddenly, the telephone began to ring as if it meantto wake the dead. With a nervousness that wasalmost unendurable, Polly crossed the room andtook down the receiver."Oh, it is you, Doctor Burton!" There wasintense relief in the tone. "Of course. Bringher right here. How dreadful! I'll have everything ready."The message was from the crossroads, a quarter of a mile away. There had been a fearfulaccident some automobile, "joy-riders," the Doctor said, a woman badly, perhaps fatally hurt.Although Polly realized keenly the horror ofthe message, she felt personally as though shehad been granted a reprieve from a sentence ofdeath. She hurried away to make ready for theinjured woman, and the physical activity gaveher nerves relief.Very soon, she heard voices coming up thewalk. As she opened the door, the cold nightwind rushed past her into the house. The figurethey bore silently up the steps seemed limp andlifeless. In a fresh, sweet room, they laid herdown. Polly took the cold hand and chafed itgently. The ministering angel in her had awakened. The Doctor looked at Polly."Am afraid this is an imposition," he said ina short, dry tone that made Polly look at himin surprise. "I should not have brought thiswoman here. It is not fit.""Oh!" cried Polly, with indrawn breath, holding the long, slim hand firmly in her own. "Notfit? What do you mean? She is a woman,perhaps a mother, who knows?""Who knows?" repeated the doctor, as he took'the woman's wrist between his fingers. "Whoknows?"The eyes of the woman opened wide andlooked about. From the doctor's face, theyturned to Polly, then wandered restlessly aboutthe room, as if in search of something, untilthey rested on a Madonna and Child. A lookof pain swept the face; but the eyes were rivetedon the picture, which held them as by a spell.Her lips moved, but the words were unintelligible. The girl bent over her with quick sympathy. "What is it?" she asked. "Is there something?" "The picture, the child," the woman muttered,"take it away. I I can not stand it. Takeit away." Closing her eyes firmly, she coveredher face with her hands.The doctor beckoned Polly from the room."Call some one to take your place here," hesaid. "I will have to leave. There is nothingmore to do; it is merely a question of time.'One more unfortunate,' that is all."At his words, Polly's pent-up feeling gave wayin a burst of tears. The doctor patted hershoulder."Never mind, little girl," he said, "I shouldnot have brought her here. The passing of sucha woman is not to be regretted; you will learnthis when you know more of the world.""Learn to be hard, and cold, and unjust? Godforbid!" cried Polly, as the tears streamed unrestrainedly down her cheeks. "If it were aman who had sinned, as she has sinned, wouldyou speak of him as you do of her? Thereshould be only one standard. Before God thereis but one. How dare we set up a standard ofour own."The doctor turned impatiently and for a moment stood again beside the bed, then, with afew directions, left the house. Polly was gladwhen he had gone. She had never seen himlike that before. With brimming eyes, she returned to the room, and looked at the figure onthe bed. How graceful she was! What soft,well-formed hands!Polly suddenly became conscious of eyes fixedon her face."It is good of you to cry," the woman saidsimply, "I scarcely deserve it."Polly fell on her knees and buried her faceagainst the bed. The woman put her hand tenderly on Polly's hair."What did you do with the picture?" she asked."The picture?" said Polly. "I put it away. Didyou want it?""Yes," she whispered, "put it back; it kinderlights the room, and and 'I don't want to gohome in the dark.' I will look at the picture andtry to feel that I have my little one in my arms;my arms that never yearned before, how hungrythey are now! I always hated children Don'tstare like that; it is the truth but now, now itis too late, I feel their light breath on my cheek,and O, I love it so!""Children!" cried Polly, something clutching ather heart. "Have you children?""I had two blessed cherubs," she said; "but Iwas not fit, not worthy. God knew it and tookthe little girl away; she has gone, but the littleboy His father brought him down here andleft him with a friend near the old home. Wasin search of him when this happened. God knewI was not seeking him for love, but for revenge,and so He laid His hand on me; but, in this hour,the love has come, the love I had not knownbefore. Now my arms are empty and there :sno hope, I cry for mercy: 'O Lord hear; O Lordforgive.' "The voice grew faint, the lips ceased to move,the eyes closed. Polly rose and went softly fromthe room. In a moment, she reappeared withthe sleeping child pressed to her bosom. Intothe arms of the sick woman, she placed the littleform. With motherly instinct, they closed abouthim. The child nestled close with a sigh ofcontentment, and placed a chubby hand in themother's hair. She opened her eyes and lookedat the child. There was no surprise in the face,just the glory of fulfilment."My little boy," she whispered, the mothernote in the voice. She pressed her dry lips tothe unconscious head. "Cherub 'The BlessedCherub his father was right.""God's plan," breathed Polly, "God's plan."The woman lifted her eyes and looked straightinto Polly's face. There was peace in those eyesthat was past understanding."You are Polly," she said, quietly, "the loyallittle girl of whom I have always heard. AskNed to forgive me, and never let the little oneknow. . . . Take his arms and place themabout my neck, won't you? Ah, that is good ofyou. 'The night is far spent, the day is at hand:let us therefore cast off the works of darkness,and let us put on the armor of light.'

While it has become recognized as the song of the Southland, it is almost as well loved in the North, andhas become recognized as one of our nationalanthems. Strange, indeed, that this song thatsends the heart of the Southerner bounding andbeating and inspires him with patriotism such asno other song does should have been written bya Northern man. Stranger, too, that this songthat is so full of that kind of music that inspiresand thrills was not written, as most other greatnational songs have been written, through inspiration. Years before the war, when Negro minstrelsywas the most popular form of entertainment andwhen the bones and the tambo were instrumentsof delight and the end man was an importantbeing, Old Dan Emmett, as he was lovinglycalled, the author of "Old Dan Tucker," rankedhigh in popular favor. He wrote "Dixie" as hehad written "Old Dan Tucker," with a desire togive his audience something catchy and he certainly succeeded, for "Dixie" will remain as aneverlasting monument to him. It's inspiring tonenever failed to awaken enthusiasm.In 1904, one of the great hotels in New YorkCity included it in its nightly program of music,for the reason that many Southerners were constantly guests there. On June 28th of that year,as the orchestra struck up "Dixie," the crowdedroom expressed its intense pleasure. While thistribute was being paid to "Dixie," the old minstrel author, forgotten by the world at large, laydying in his humble home at Mount Vernon,Ohio.Daniel Decatur Emmett was born in Mt. Vernon, Ohio, October 29, 1815. His grandfatherwas a soldier in the Revolution, fighting underMorgan at the Cowpens. His father, who was ablacksmith, fought in the War of 1812, in -theregiment commanded by Lewis Cass. Dan as aboy would "blow and strike" for his father inthe latter's smithy. At intervals between hiswork he ran errands or played the fiddle for thevillagers. He managed to pick up an elementaryeducation, and when thirteen years of age entered a newspaper office as compositor. The result of his experience in printing offices is saidto have been shown in the careful punctuationof his manuscripts. He still was working "atthe case" when, at the age of fifteen or sixteen,he wrote "Old Dan Tucker." A year later heenlisted in the United States Army as a fifer,and during his service also learned to drum.More than sixty years later, after his death, therewas found among his manuscripts one entitled"Emmet's Standard Drummer," which is a complete school for fife and drum "according tothe 'Ashworth mode.' "After serving a full enlistment he traveled withvarious circus bands. At that time negro minstrelsy was as yet unknown, although there wereindividual Ethiopian performers, like Dan Riceof "Jim Crow" fame. Emmett had traveled withRice whose performances possibly suggested thenegro minstrel idea to the young drummer. Asin all such cases, various claims to priority areadvanced, but it is certain that early in 1843. inNew York, Emmett organized a string quartet,with violin, banjo, tambourine and bones andnamed it the Virginia Minstrels, first carefullylooking up the word minstrels in the dictionaryto assure himself that it could be applied appro-Its Author and Its HistoryBy Rebecca R. Laughlinpriately to the new organization. The costumeconsisted of white trousers, stiped calico andblue calico coat with exaggerated swallowtails.It was not until some years later that the regulation evening dress was adopted as a costumemost suitable to the mock dignity of minstrelsy.Emmett's troupe showed successfully in various American cities, but when it adventured atour of England it promptly stranded. Its organizer returned to New York, found that hisidea had been utilized by others, and eventuallyjoined Bryant's Minstrels. From that time onand until he returned to Mt. Vernon, his occupation was Negro minstrelsy. His retirement wasdue to his age and to the fact that changes inthe style of minstrel performance had made hima "back number." As composer of "Dixie" hehad long since been forgotten. He actually hadbeen overshadowed by its popularity.Dixie's adoption as the war song of the Southoriginated in the excitement it caused when sungon the stage of New Orleans Varieties Theatre,in the spring of 1861, when Mrs. John Wood wasappearing there in "Pocahontas." A feature ofthe performance was a Zouave march which wasintroduced into the last scene. A catchy tunewas wanted for this, and Carlo Patti, the leaderof the orchestra, after trying over several pieces,decided on "Dixie." He little knew what thatdecision would mean for the song. When theZouaves marched on the first night, led by MissSusan Denin, singing "Dixie," the audience wentwild and demanded seven encores. From NewOrleans it seemed to flash over the entire South;the Washington Artillery had the tune arrangedfor a quickstep and the whole section of thecountry rang with it. Pickett ordered it playedbefore his famous charge at Gettysburg. Thusthe anomaly was presented of a song written andcomposed by a man who was born in the North,and who as a matter of fact sympathized withthe North, becoming the war song of the South.General Albert Pike and others wrote additionalverses, and these form the only foundation forthe claim sometimes advanced that Emmett wasnot the author and composer of "Dixie," whereashis name has appeared on the copyrighted titlepage of the song even since its earliest publication. General Pike's words to "Dixie" first appearedin the "Natchez Courier," April 30, 1861. Hereare some of the characteristic stanzas:Southrons, hear your country call you!Up, lest worse than death befall you!To arms! To arms! To arms, in Dixie!Lo! all the beacon fires are lighted.Let all hearts be now united!To arms! To arms! To arms, in Dixie!Chorus.Advance the flag of Dixie! Hurrah! Hurrah!For Dixie's Land we take our stand, and liveand die for Dixie!To arms! To arms! And conquer peace for Dixie!To arms! To arms! And conquer peace for Dixie!Hear the Northern thunders mutter!Northern flags in South winds flutter!To arms, etc.Send them back your fierce defiance!Stamp upon the accursed alliance!To arms, etc.Fear no danger! Shun no labor!Lift up rifle, pike and sabre!To arms, etc.Shoulder pressing close to shoulder,Let the odds make each heart bolder!To arms, etc.How the South's great heart rejoices,At your cannon's ringing voices!To arms, etc.For faith betrayed and pledges broken,Wrongs inflicted, insults spoken,To arms, etc.Another version that was very popular withSouthern soldiers began:Away down South in de fields of cotton,Cinnamon seed, and sandy bottom!Look away! look away! look away! lookaway!Den 'way down South in de fields of cotton,Vinegar shoes and paper stockings!Look away! look away! look away! lookaway!Emmett wrote "Dixie" while he was a memberof the famous Bryant's Minstrels which he hadjoined in 1857. He was known already as thecomposer of "Old Dan Tucker," and he was engaged by Bryant not only in the capacity of astrge performer, but also to compose Negro songsand walk-arounds. The performance alwayswound up with an est-mble called the "walkaround," which was (or was supposed to be) agenuine bit of plantation life. The compositionof fetching walk-around-:, was a knack with Em-n-ettthat made him a valuable acquisition for aminstrel troupe. Moreover, he had a good voiceand played many instruments, but especiallyviolin and flute.On Saturday night, September 17, 1859, afterthe performance, one of the Bryants told Emmettthat a new walk-around was wanted in time forrehearsal on Monday. The minstrel replied thatwhile the time was very short he would do hisbest. That night after he reached home he triedto hit upon some tune, but the music wouldn't.come. His wife cheerily told him to wait untilmorning; he should have the room to himself sothat he could work undisturbed, and when hehad finished the walk-around he could play it forher as sole audience. If she liked it, the Bryantswould, and so would the average listener.Next day was rainy and dismal. Some yearsbefore, Emmett had traveled with a circus as adrummer. In winter the warm Southern circuitwas a popular route with circus people, and thosewho were obliged to show North would saywhen the cold weather would make them shiver,"I wish I was in Dixie." The phrase was infact a current circus expression. On that dismalSeptember day, probably the beginning of theequinox, when Emmett stepped to the windowand looked out, the old longing for the pleasantSouth came over him, and involuntarily hethought to himself, "I wish I was in Dixie." Likea flash the thought suggested the first line for awalk-around, and a little later the minstrel, fiddlein hand, was working out the melody which,coupled with the words, made "Dixie" a genuinesong of the people almost from the instant itbegan with a verse which was omitted at the performance. The minstrels were very careful not to(Continued on page 13.)12THE MONTHLY MAGAZINEChristmas at PleasantValley(Continued from page 3.)with all Pleasant Valley present. BigGeorge Wells, who as town marshal,had little to do but draw his salary,but whose importance as livery stable owner was excelled by his position as clerk of the "Commission"and ex officio member thereof, wasthe marshal for the events. Uponhim was devolved the duty of supervising the big dinner, and to himwere brought all the good things prepared for that occasio . The youngmen worked hard in these events.Their sweethearts and mothers andfathers were there, and the inspiration brought out the best that was inthem. These events were concludedwith a "tug of war" between the townboys and the farmers. The friendlyrivalry between the factions was intense and everybody enjoyed the funand sport. The victors accepted victory with modesty, the vanquishedtook their defeat in the same generous manner, and cheered their successful opponents. And then aftereach event there was the anticipationof the enjoyment in the event tocome. At twelve o'clock there weresandwiches, cider and real milk foreverybody, and at half past twelvethe prizes were awarded. At halfpast one the doors of the big barnwere thrown open and everybody wasgiven a sight of the long dining tablesand the big Christmas tree. As eachname was called by Judge Johnson,he or she stepped forward and SantaClaus presented the gift marked andthe recipient passed down to his seatproudly exhibiting his gift to all.When the gifts were all distributedand eveiyone had been shown to hisplace by Marshal Wells and his assistants selected for that duty, the funand noise stopped for a moment whilebenediction was pronounced. MarshalWells gave the signal and the waiter started in with the turkeys. Therewere twenty-five royal birds, roastedby their donors, and warmed in thebig ranges in the barn kitchen. Theseweie followed by the roast pigs.The tables were apportioned off insections of twenty-five, with twocarvers at each section. Only thoseof known skill were selected for thisenviable position, and they all proudlyrose and the music of twenty-fiveknives against as many steels filledthe room, and the dinner began. Atone side of the center of the bigtable was a smaller table where wasseated the youth of Pleasant Valley.When the age of fifteen was reachedthe youths of the community wereentitled to sit at that table and theyall longingly looked forward to thatage to entitle them that privilege.The first chapter of many a sweetlittle love story was written there andthe life history of many a happy family seated at the big table, commencedat the smaller one. When the stagesof the pumpkin and mince pies andplum pudding had been reached andpassed and the dinner finished, JudgeJohnson introduced the orator ofstate wide fame who was the guestof honor of Pleasant Valley and forhalf an hour he led them throughpathos and humor, tingling theirblood with thrills of patriotism to aclimax of beautiful simile. He toldthem the story of the pioneer band,and its providential escape, of thetrials of their forefathers in the earlydays, of their part in the early gloryof the stars and stripes. The valorof an unconquered nation had unfurled that flag to the whole world asthe emblem of "Liberty." "Let usmarch," he said, "forever onward withthat glorious flag to the front, readyand willing for any sacrifice for thecommon good of the greatest nationon earth." It was a great speech, andPleasant Valley applauded him untilthe barn rang with their appreciation.Then there was music from PleasantValley's prize quartette, and thencame Farmer Johnson's turn. Hetook an American flag from his pocket and waved it in the air and everyone arose. Then as they took theirseats again, he told them of the earlydays when the farmer was the soldieras well, and told them how muchtheir country depended on such communities as theirs. Realizing this theGovernment at Washington had givenunusual attention to the developmentof agriculture. Experts had beentrained and taught to assist them.And then he told of the services rendered them by one of the best in thatprofession and how they had determined to show their appreciation.The Farmer was in his element andhis eloquent words ended in a beautiful period. He turned towards thedoor of the barn as the bull was beingled in. When he caught sight of thelittle yearling that was brought in hewas dumb-founded. His bewilderment added only to the laughter thathad arisen, for he had described inglowing terms the merits of the gift."There is some mistake," he shouted."No, my dear Farmer," said JudgeJohnson, arising, "there is no mistake, that is the gift intended for ourdear friend of expert agriculturalknowledge. We decided that whilethe best is none too good for him,that there is another member of thiscommunity who has given his bestservices to us daily, weekly, and yearly, all during his life, who is deserving of our love and appreciation, andevery good thing you have said of theother man applies to him." At thispoint. Marshal Wells entered the barnproudly leading a magnificent youngJersey bull."Farmer Johnson," resumed theJudge, "in behalf of Pleasant Valley,who from the oldest to the youngestloves you dearly, I present you withthis token of our regard, and mayGod bless you and keep you with usfor many, many years."After the .dinner came the children'shours, when everybody took a handin their games and sports. And thenas dusk drew on the second floor ofthe big barn was lit up and dancingbegan. That night Farmer Johnson'sgood wife said, "Did you have a goodtime, today, father?""Bully," he answered.fi33li3jAp()yILPLAYING CARDSGOLD EDGESFor Social PlayDainty, beautiful artbacks in full color.

He included them insome of his manuscript copies of thesong, but the version generally knownbegins with the familiarI wish I was in de land ob cotton,Old times dar am not forgotten;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!In Dixie land whar I was born in,Early on one frosty mornin',Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Chorus.Den I wish I was in Dixie! Hooray!Hooray!In Dixie's Land we'll take our stand,to lib an' die in Dixie.Away! away! away down South inDixie.Away! away! away down South inDixie.The stanzas which followed underwent slight changes from time totime. In their final shape they are:Ole missus marry "Will de weaber;"Willum was a gay deceaber;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!But when he put his arm around her,He smiled as fierce as a forty-pounder;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!His face was sharp as a butcher'scleaber!Bu4- dat did not seem to greab her;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Ole missus acted the foolish part,And died for a man dat broke herheart!Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Dixie," the Song of the Southland(Continued from page n.)Now here's health to de next oleamissus,An' all the gals dat want to kiss us;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!But if you want to drive 'way sorrow,Come and hear dis song to-morrow;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Dar's buckwheat cakes an Injin batter,Makes you fat or a little fatter;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Den hoe it down an' scratch yourgrabble,To Dixie's Land I'm bound to trabble;Look away! look away! look away!Dixie Land!Mrs. Emmet had suggested plain"Dixie" as a title for the song, andher husband had adopted it. Butwhen the song was published in 1860,it was called, "I wish I was in DixieLand," a line which does not occurin it. Afterwards it was published as"Dixie Land" but to the public itsimply is "Dixie," which shows thatwhen M-s. Emmet suggested thatone word for a title, she knew whatshe was about. Emmett himselfstated that he had received five hundred dollars for the copyright of"Dixie," and that what he had receivedfor all his other songs put together(which, it should be remembered, included his popular "Dan Tucker")would be fairly represented by onehundred dollars; so that during a lifetime of eighty-nine years his receiptsas a popular song composer amounttc six hundred dollars and obscurityin a little "Western town!When he was eighty years old heat last had a taste of what it is to befamous and one season of it wasenough for him. He went out with aminstrel troupe in the supposed roleof venerable figurehead. But whenat the first performance the orchestrastruck up "Dixie," he rose and, withold-time gestures and in a voice tremulous with age, sang the song.Throughout the South he was the object of ovation after ovation. He wasgrateful, but he also was amused, forhe could not help thinking of thehumble origin of his song and howfar it had gotten away from its original purpose and his own sentimentswhen it became a war song.However, he enjoyed the tour, butwas content to go back to MountVerncn, Ohio, where he remained until his death. There his little hut, agarden patch and some chickens afforded him a sparse livelihood. Shortly before his death The Actors' Fundof America, when informed of hiswhereabouts, gi anted him a small pittance. He sometimes received paltrysums with requests for his autographor manuscript copies of "Dixie." Oneof the most touching examples of hisobscuiity is that not even his townspeople were aware that he was thecomposer of the much loved "Dixie"that has been and is destined to beenjoyed f. r generations to come fromone end of the country to the other.That Emmett was deeply religious isevidenced by the fact that he couldoften be seen sitting outside his doorreading the Bible This assertion isstrengthened by the further fact thathe left among his many manuscriptsa set of prayers, of which he is theapparent author. He was endowedwith a rare spirit of resignation and"ndifference to all that is material inlife. And now that he has left us, hisfellow countrymen, who were contentto have him live ii poverty and obscurity in the little cottage at MountVernon, are desirous of paying hismemory lie debt of reverence andgratitude! The most consoling feature of this is that he little cared, butthanked God daiiy for "this frugalmeai and all other meals Thou haspermitted me to enjoy during my pastexistence."perience is that the milk supply ofpractically all cities is constantly improving, and that systematic sanitary methods are also accompaniedby business efficiency in breeding,feeding, and the selection or disposalof animals according to their capacityfor profitable production.The very extensive experiment inmilk control which we are conductingin cooperation with the LexingtonCity Board of Health is showing better results than yet reported for acity's entire milk supply.
