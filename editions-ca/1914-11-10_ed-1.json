decided which he will take up.
. Receipt of turkeys for the Thanks
giving market began yesterday at the
jens of Chas. S. Brent & Bro., at
;P&risf Carlisle, Millersburg and Flem
ingsburg." Twelve cents per pound
-an foot delivered at the pens, was the
opening price.
TurKey raisers will not receive as
much by 20 per cent, for their turkeys
.this year as they did last year. There
iare numerous reasons why the price of
turkejs this year will be lower than
lasi. year. The output all over the
cDcntry is unusually large. The early
drouth was favorable to the young
"birds, and the thousands of young
-turkeys that usually succumb to the
-cole chilling rains got a good start and
vill be fat and fine for the holiday
-trade.
With a big output of well fattened
turkeys in good condition, the country
3s face to face with a hesitating niar
ket, due to the lack of employment in
-.the East, the scarcity of money and
everywhere a desire to economize
Five million pounds of dressed tur
keys were carried over in cold storage
from last year. This great bulk of
cold storage turkeys would have been
reduced to the minumum if not entire
ly" wiped out in feeding passengers
rtraveling to and from Europe, hut the
-war put a stop to ocean travel and
tthe cold storage stock camfe in com
petition with the fresh killed stock.
Tor this reason the price of turkeys
mil he the lowest in years.
In Boston, New York, Philadelphia
and other large cities the price of
.turkeys last year went up to 28 cents
;per pound, whereas in the same mar
kets this year choice turkeys are sell
ing at 20 and 22 cents per pound,
i dressed. Buyers and dealers in dress
,ed turkeys throughout Central Ken
' jtucky have been advised of the situa
tion and they say that the market in
.this vicinity will hover close to 12
wcents per pound for the best birds,
with .No. 2's selling at ten cents per
