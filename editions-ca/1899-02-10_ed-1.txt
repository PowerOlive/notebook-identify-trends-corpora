of theenemy still offer desultory oppositionthe main body of the rebels is in fullretreat and utterly routedOf the hordes of troops originallydrawn up in battle array against theAmericans fully one third are alreadyincapacitated and the others are scattered in every directionThe terrible loss of the rebels maybe gathered from the fact that 160 ofthem were buried in one rice field onMonday near Pasas and that 87 wereinterred between Paco and SantaAnnaA converted river gunboat did terrible execution among the rebels sweeping both banks of the river with herGatling guns and her heavier batteryHundreds of Filipinos undoubtedlycrawled into the canebrakes and diedthereThe Americans are working nobly intheir efforts to find the wounded and arebringing hundreds of suffering rebelsto the hospitals for treatment Thenatives are unable to understand thehumane motives which prompt the victors to succor the wounded of theenemyA press correspondent is informedthat members of the hospital ccrpshave made the startling discovery thatthere are several women in male dressand with hair cropped among thedeadThe chief of the Ygorates the Filipino natives who fought so gallantly in the face of our artillery fire with their bows andarrows is in a hospital with a shattered thigh He admits that henever saw modern artillery and was ignorant of its effects until he and hisfollowers met the disastrous fire ofSunday morning The chief is bitterlyincensed against the Tagalos for placing the Ygorates in front of the American battery under the pretense thatthey were sent to occupy a po6t ofhonor and he intimates that the Y gorotes will avenge this treachery whenthe survivor return northIt is regarded as a significant factthat many of the Filipino officials ofthis city disappeared from Manila assoon as hostilities commenced Someof them are supposed to be still hidinghereHundreds of women are pouring intoManila from all districts as the vilages around Manila have as a rulebeen destroyed by the troopsThe further the Americans extendtheir lines the aiore the need ofmeans of transportation increasesThe American commanders have already been compelled to impress horsesand vehicles on all sides to the inconvenience naturally of the civiliansAll the public conveyances at thiswriting have either baen impressed orhave disappeared in some manner orother Street car traffic however hasbeen resumed and the cars are runningregularly though the streetsare almost deserted There are a fewnative stores open and white flags inthe nature of towels pillow slips andaprons tied to bamboos adorn thewindows of the native residenceseverywhere But in spite of theseemblems of peace scores of Filipinosunder the cover of the darkness firedfrom these same windows Mondayevening on the American patrolAt 9 oclock Monday night therewas a general fusilade in theQuipo and Binon districts The inhabitants of the city generally beJieved that a battle was raging atFirst That peace and friendly relationswith the Americans be broken and that thelatter be treated as enemies within the limitsprescribed by the laws of warSecond That the Americans captured beheld as prisoners of warThird That this proclamation be communicated to the consuls and thst congressorder and accord a suspension of the constitutional guarantee resulting from the declaration of warAguinaldos proclamation of Mondaysays the outbreak of hostilities wasunjustly and unexpectedly provokedby the Americans refers to his manifesto of 8 publishing the alleged grievances of the Filipinos atthe hands of the army of occupationand the constant outrages and tauntswhich have been causing misery te theMnilans and refers to the uselessconferences and contempt shown forthe Filipino government as proving apremeditated transgression of justiceand libertyThe rebel leader also refers to theformer losses of the Filipinos but saysslavery is bitter and calls uponthem to sacrifice all upon the alter ofhonor and national integrity He insists that he tried to avoid as far as possible an armed conflict but claimsthat all his efforts were useless before the unmeasured pride of theAmericans whom he charged as having treated him as a rebel because Idefended the interests of my countryand would not become the instrumentof their dastardly intentionsAguinaldo concludes with sayingBe not discouraged Our independence was watered freely by the bloodof martyrs and more will be shed inthe future to strengthen it Remember that efforts are not to be wastedthat ends may be gained It is indispensable to adjust our

returned fromBoston 7Just this miuute sir replied theoftice boy Hes in the back room getting his mailDr Lampkin entered the office andtt diown in one of the sof t leather-coveredchairsA moment later the detective entereda package of unopened letters in hishandOh he ejaculated Hello giad toee youLve been wondering What had become of you said the doctor as he roseand shook the disengaged hand of hisfriend Every time 1 dropped in jouroffice boy told me he was expecting youon the very next trainDelayed from hour to hour for nearly two weeks frowned HendricksThen he laughed The joke is on meold man 1 had really plumed myselfon the reputation 1 was going to makeover there to get even with the Bostonpapers for sneering at New Yorks bigdetective as they called me but loand behold just as 1 was about to stirup the phlegmatic old village by showluff jriv hand uiv man made a cleanbreast and gave himself up to the police Did you ever hear of such luckLampkin laughed as he took a cigarfrom the detectives boxAnything ou hand hereot a blessed thing 1 might forgetmy awful humiliation if I could plungeinto work heels over headAs the doctor smoked Hendricks began to open his letters He had castaside three and was beginning on thefourth when his visitor saw him startgrasp his beard and pull on it excitedlyBy Jove he cried and his big grayeyes seemed to expand as they staredat the sheet before themWhats up now questioned thedoctor leaning forwardThe detective seemed not to hear Hefolded the letter leaned back in his revolving chair anu made a clumsy attempt to prop his feet up ou the edgeof his willow waste basket but thefraii thing turned over and his heavyheels struck the floor with a hollowsoundLampkin studied the strong featuresof his companion with pleasurablecuriosity He was almost sure that he-had detected just the faintest suggestion of horror in his friends expression which was indeed a rare thingThen Hendricks shrugged his shouldersgave a half defiant dogged laugh andproceeded to open another letterHe had scarcely drawn it from its envelope however when he dropped itand musingly took up the other againThere was silence while he perused itThen he askedLampkin have you ever heard thename of Weldou CaruthersHavent you returned the doctora note of surprise in his voiceIt seems farmiliar to me and yet 1cant exactly place itHe is one of the ultra swell set replied Lampkin I met him once he isvery well-to-do a thorough society manmember of the Van Derwenter cluband all that sort of thing 1 know a lotof interesting gossip about himHendricks fixed the speaker with hissharp eyesI presume you heard of his beingmurdered in eold blood said the detective tentativelyMurdered Surely you dont meanitYes let me see Hendricks deliberately consulted the date of the letterin his hand and even more slowly examined the postmark on the envelopeYes this writer informs me that thecrime was committed in Caruthers4apartments in the Palace hotel just aweek ago to nightThe doctor took a deep breathOh its a hoax a mistake hesaid in relief I noticed in this mornings paper that Caruthers was in hisbox at the Horse Show last night Iwas running over the list of men whohad the most conspicuous places and remember seeing his nameWhat paper did you see it inLampkin thought he noticed the peculiar twitching about the corners ofthe detectives mouth which usuallyindicated suppressed excitementThe World I think yes Im positive1 was looking over it at breakfastHendricks1 features seemed to settleinto rigidityAre you quite sure he said mechanically and he leaned forward andtapped the bell on his desk Lampkintan that his thoughts were a thousandmiles away nevertheless he answeredAs sure as I could be of anythingbesides you dont suppose a man ofCaruthers prominence could have beenmurdered in the cwellest hotel in NewYork without its being known for aweekIt dos look that way acquiescedthe detective but there was still a reserve in his manner and tone that puzzled his friendThe office boy came in and stood atthe end of the deskBring me this mornings Worldthe detecthe orderedXot satisfied smiled the doctorHendricks made no reply He left hischair and began to walk back andforth across the room nervously stroking his beard He turned when theTHE BOURBON NEWS PAK1S KY FRIDboy laid the paper on the desk Heopened the paper signaling to the boyto leave the room and began to turnthe leaves with fingers which seemedtoo clumsy for useHang it find it for me he said abruptlyLampkin opened the paper at theplace devoted to society news and puthis finger on a paragraphThere you are he said Theresyour man who has been dead a weekXow what are you frowning aboutOne would think Caruthers was a rivalof yours that vou want put out of thewayHendricks drew a deep breath andhanded the letter which had so disturbed him to his friendRead it he saidWhat the doctor saw was a sheet ofcrisp blue linen paper and on it thefollowing typewritten wordsMinard Hendricks Detective New YorkCityAstute SirIf you will take the trouble to go to thePalace Hotel to night after you receive thisand will inquire for Mr Weldon Caruthersyou will be told that he is out of town butif you will insist on going to his apartmentson the second floor you will And there hisremains He has been murdered and the jobhas been done so well that the chief actorin the game has not the slightest fear of detection and takes this humble opportunityof pitting his wits against yours now socelebrated You are a great detective Hendricks and they say you have never failedBut this my dear sir shall be your WaterlooLampkin laid the letter down andturned to Hendricks who stood at hiselbowIt is plainly an idle joke he saidI am astonished at your being disturbed over itDo I look disturbed asked Hendricks absent mindedly and turning toa large lounge he threw himself on itI am absolutely worn out for onething and thenHe paused It was plain to the doctor that the detectives mental excitement had crippled his faculty for putting words togetherLook here said Lampkin drawinga chair near his friend and sittingdown I say whats the matter withvou anyway VHendricks laughedI may as well tell you the wholetruth and unburthen myself he began The fact is doctor I have neverin all my experience had but one thingto really trouble me and this lettersomehow seems to be connected withthat particular thing I have nevermentioned it to a single soul except mymother but she never talks of my affairs although I really believe that happening has added ten years to her ageTo make a long story short about threemonths ago after Kola that East Indian friend of mine and 1 had beenhard at work all day in my libraryover some papers connected with theIlilburn murder case 1 sent him offand joined my mother at dinner Ialways sat at rhe bead of the table ina high backed chair upholstered in softleather something like the material onthis lounge That night when 1 satdown I heard in the deep seat of thechair a fizzing sound like a rocket getting ready to mount and smelt theodorof burning powder With what littlepresence of mind the good Lord hasgiven me 1 sprang up and kicked thechair from me half across the roomIt lay there and spluttered for a secondand then the little cloud of smoke disappeared from itMy mother almost fainted andI had to look after her but Ireturned to the chair in a fewmoments and carefully carried itout into the coal house Lampkin itcontained the biggest most deadlybomb you ever saw It was a roundpolished brass ball about three inchesin diameter of a make I have neverseen before My quick action and thewarning the burning fuse gave mesaved my life I carefully drew out theupholsterers brass headed tacks andsaw the contrivance to fire the fuse aspring affair to strike a match when 1sat down Doctor that thing sends acold shudder up my spine every timeI think of it and I think of it too oftenfor my peace of mind 1 tell youI should think it would worry yousaid the doctor It certainly was anarrow escapeIt shelved that I had an enemywas the detectives reply And thisanonymous communication after threemonths of silence on his part Showshe i still alive and inventiveAh I see You tlunK tnai ieneiwas a trick to lure you into a trap bysome oneIt has that appearance The letterwas delayed by my absence from townAs 1 was expecting every hour to getback I did not have my mail forwardedAnd your absence perhaps savedyour life again added LampkinHendricks nodded and gave a grimsmileThat letter was not written by afool doctor but I must not think of itI I must get to work Keep your seatIll be through soonHendricks as he spoke rose and wentto his desk again Lampkin smiled inadmiration when he saw his friendsface clear as he plunged into his correspondence Presently however hecaught Hendricks glance asit roved absently round the roomCome come ohided the doctoryou are thinking of that lefctetr andthebomb againNot that exactly the detectivesaid but ail at once it has occurredto me that I havent given my anonymous correspondent a fair showingHe says Caruthers has been murderedand we havent really a bit of actualproof that he is lyingBut cried Lampkin remonstra tangly the letter was written a week agoand to days paper says he was at theHorse Show last nightPapers are not infallible saidHendricks tapping his call bell Something in the general tone of this communication makes me think that thewriter really meant to furnish me witha grewsome exhibition in Caruthersapartments My invitation comes latebut I am going to acceptThe office boy came inBring me to days Herald quickHendricks commanded with quite achange of toneThis time as the detective took thepaper and began to open it all his customary calmness and deliberateshrewdness seemed to settle on himFor a moment his penetrating gazerested on the Notes of the HorseShow Then he grunted significantlyas he took up a pencil and drew a circlearound a short paragraphThere he ejaculated You seethis paper says Caruthers did not occupy his box last night that as he wasout of town the box was courteouslyextended to Count Bantinni and hisparty Miss Huntington her aunt andother ladiesLampkin rose an incredulous expression on his face and leaned over thepaper He started to speak but Hendricks had suddenlj dropped his handon the call bell with considerableforceWhat is it sir asked the boy fromthe portals of the door leading into theante roomTo days Sun said the detectivegiving his friend a strange lookWhen the boy had brought the paper Hendricks looked over the HorseShow news most deliberatelyXo mention of Caruthers here whatever he said finally Doctor whattime is itEleven oclock said the doctorDo you want me to leaveThe detective reached for his overcoatCome walk over to the Palace hotelwith meAre you going to make inquiriesthereI shall at least find out if Caruthershas returned rejoined Hendricks re-IT LAY THERE SPLUTTERINGflectively just a touch of evasion in histone You see he may have an enemywho really intended to harm him insome way a week ago and in such amatter a man ought to be put on hisguardOf course answered LampkinYou are quite rightThe detective thrust his hand into hispocket for his gloves and drew themout in a disreputable wadId like to ascertain too if this letter was written by my avowed enemyYou see Id go a good many lengths toget even the faintest clew to his identityAs the two friends turned into sightof the twelve story hotel they saw infront of it a long line of fashionablecarriages from which were alightingmen and ladies in evening dressSwell blow out commented Hendricks Doctor we ought to have onour swallow tails and white necktiesI have almost given up that sort ofthing replied the doctor My principal amusement nowadays seems tobe watching you at your work If thateastern chap Kola hadnt won yourheart so completely Id have given ipmy own aims and tried to become yourright bowerYou arc that already old man returned the detective But Kola cantbe depended on When it suits him heworks with me like a prairie on tirebut often when I have the most important matters on hand I find him in hisold rat hole of a den drugged to hiseyes in the suffocating smoke and odorof incense and moving about in hisgray robe and cowl like a half-mummifiedmonk Ugh he gives me the alloversYou have never told me much abouthim said the doctor The time 1 methim during your investigations ot tneBenton murder case he interested megreatlyHendricks shook his head1 dont go much on what cant be explained to my full satisfaction and Jcant explain Kola When I ask himto turn the light on his queer mode oflife he grins shakes his head and saysit would take 20 years of study andascetic living in the east to comprehend even the rudimentary part ofhis outlandish philosophy I didnt tellhim I was going to Boston and he mayfeel miffed at me but hell get over itBy this

in that district and Jack thoughtit a capital idea that he should accompany Mr Casey the engineer who hadundertaken to open the businessMr Casey divided his men into gangsand sent them out to familiarize themselves with the woods and to report onlimber lands With Jacks assistancehe felt equal to the task of getting upsteam Scarcely had the water beguno bubble when one of the men returned to ask Mr Casey to examinesome fine timber close at hand andi he engineer left the mill At the mosthi would not be gone more than 20rinutes and he had every confidencei Jack who had been about machinethopa ever since his infancyThe steam had generated with unexpected rapidity and the quiveringrange showed a pressure of 110 poundslie remembered having heard Mr Caseyay that the boilers test was 100emds and he knew that he resultthe present state of affairs was aexplosion He made a franticive for the open door but as hejumped he slipped in his great rubberxots and fell sprawling on the floorHis outstretched hand gave the door arap and to his horror he heard thesharp click of the spring lock that declared him a prisonerHis one chance was to open thesafety valve He approached the roaring boiler and looked for the valve Hesaw where the trouble lay The valvewas fastened down with rust which thecleaners had overlooked He felt surethat he could wrench the valve openbut as he was about to grasp the supply pipe to heist himself to the propeJlevel a fearful spectacle caught his eyeCoiled about the pipe was an enormotis rattlesnakeWith a frightened scream JacHijumped backward to the floor only tofind that he had stepped on a softurithing mass Then it all flashed upon him The snakes had crawled inothe walls of the disused mill in searchof winter quarters The heat hadawakened them from the lethargy fanu hich they commonly passed the coldermonths and they had come out of theirhiding places hungry and viciousLying on the shadowy floor not ayard from him a wicked looking blackhead was lifted threateningly andpair of green eyes glittered in the darkInstinctively he reached out his handand to his delight it touched an ironbar leaning against the wall He shuddered as he grasped it for the boilerseemed to be making frantic lunges inhis direction so great was the vibration Yet in a moment he masteredhimself The snakes were his present foes and there arose within him awild desire to encompass their destruction The upraised bar came down withgreat force on the head of the snakethat had attacked him He felt itsbody yield and break with the blowand he burst into a savage laugh Asecond stroke brought death to thecreature he had trod uponYet all the time he knew that thereal fight would come between himand the reptile that had coiled aboutthe supply pipe The creature was becoming infuriated at the jarring of itsplace of rest and was prepared to ventits venom on JackAs he approached the creature unwound a couple of coils and darted itshead out at him threateningly Thewily snake would not allow him tocome within arms length and he couldget no opportunity to aim a blowJack saw that the intense heat wascompelling the reptile to leave the supply pipe It might be possible yet toopen the valve and avert the explosionThe gauge was showing 120 poundsHe began to ploy fast and loose withthe snake tormenting it daringly withhis iron bar and apparently throwinghimself in its way His wiles had thedesired effect The great creature aggravated past bearing dropped heavilyto the floor and began to coil for thefatal springThe bar came down with a flail likesound and the snake lay dead amongitc kindred while Jack at last reachedthe supply pipe and with one mightyblow knocked off the safety valve andlet the cloud of vapor rise skywardMr Casey saw the

wardepartment being taken from thecommissary stores at Atlanta and Savannah Prof Wiley reports that all thesample were in good condition Acareful chemical examination failed todisclose the preseiu e of either borax orsulphites or sulphu ous boric salicylicor benzoic acids The only preservatives found were salt and saltpeter thformer in about the sane and the latterin a smaller quantity toau would havebeen used in private families for preservative purposes Neither lead norzinc was found in the cans the soldering having been done in such manners to prevent the solder coining in contact with the contents of the canIn conclusion Prof Wiley emphasizesthe fact that preserved foods especially meats are not preferable to the fresharticles where these can be procuredHe urgently recommends that somecompetent supervising agent be alwayspresent to inspect the packages whenopened to detect any failure of complete sterilization in their preparationor any evidences of incipient or advanced decay in their contents Whenthese precautions are observed saysProf Wiley there is no reason to believe that the ingestion of preservedmeats as an article of food in properquantities and iu properly balancedratios will in any way interfere withthe health or comfort of the person consuming them Prof Wileys examination has no direct relation into the investigation of the army supplies by thearray investigating commission butwas ordered by the secretary of agriculture in view of the important exportand farming interests that might be unfavorably affected by some of the testimony before that

becomes sore and swollen andthe grunt or squeal is hoarse The appetite is lost and swallowing causesgreat pain As the disease advancesthe breathing becomes very painfuland the pig usually sits on its haunchesand breathes through its half openmouh with a wheezing sound In aggravated cases the animal mav die infrom one to three days Affected swineshould be placed in dry comfortablequarters and fed entirely on sloppyfood An emetic at the beginuingmaycut the disease short but owing to thedifficulty in swallowing it is dangerous and must be given in food If medicine is given alone the amount

getting orders asto what hij regiment thouid do that afternoon and without waiting for Hancock to give directions he went on tostate that in his opinion as the commander of the regiment in the
