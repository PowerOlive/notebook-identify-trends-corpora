Block Island
The hum of the spinning wheel is
still a familiar sound on Block island a
quaint and interesting resort in summer
and a miniature world in winter in
which the habits and customs are those
of 150 years ago The island is 15 miles
off the Rhode Island shore and almost
directly south of stormy Point Judith
There are times during the winter
when the wind sweeps across the tree
less land at a velocitv of 84 rmlrR an
Monday Young I hour and women take their lives in
their hands when they venture out of
doors The isolation of the island is al
most complete
John Schofield established the first
woolen mill in Connecticut near Oak
dale where the carding was done by
power cards In 1798 the Block island
ers began to send wool to the mill to bo
carded into rolls and generation after
generation have kept up the practice
Formerly many bags of grain accompa
nied the wool and grist and woolen
mills were kept running day and night
while the fishermen and farmers enjoy
ed themselves in the quiet Connecticut
village until the work was done New

THE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY JANUARY 5 1897
AN INJUSTICE
Shortly after Mr Boyds return to West
Point he missed sums of money brought
from home but said nothing about it In
the class with Mr Boyd was a man who
had entered Wast Point at the avowed age
of 25 though undoubtedly much older as
his appearance indicated During wartime
the extreme of age for admission there
which before and since was and is limited
to 22 years had been extended to 25 This
Was done in order to permit young men
Vrho had achieved distinction in real war
fare the opportunity of acquiring a milita
ry education So this man named Casey
had entered at the acknowledged age of 25
He was absolutely without money and
belonged to an Irish family in humble cir
cumstances and his superior age and cun
ning unfitted Mr Boyd to cope with him
Mr Casey was compelled to procure mon
ey at all hazards Before entering West
Point he had married That fact if
known would have dismissed him at once
from the academy in accordance with the
laws governing that institution whieh
permit no cadet to marry In the academy
at that time were several cadets sons of
very wealthy parents who contrary to
West Point rules kept in their rooms at
barracks large sums of money That was
Caseys opportunity for he had constant
need of it with which to silence his wife
who had threatened his exposure
So great was the confidence of the acad
emy classmates in each other that the
money was simply placed in a trunk to
which all the clique had access and used
as a general fund Tho government sup
plies cadets with all necessary articles so
that only luxuries need be purchased
Even to those generous young men the dis
appearance of money in large sums be
came puzzling and led to inquiries which
developed into suspicions and a plan was
formed to mark some of the bills and thus
discover the evildoer
Mr Boyd by reason of his unpopulari
ty was unaware of those movements and
he had told no one of his own losses The
cadets had informed their immediate com
mandant that money was constantly be
ing stolen in the corps Aghast at such a
state of affairs he had authorized and Fe
lected a committee of eight two from
each company to find and punish the
thief In an unguarded moment the com
mandant had said If you find the offend
er you can deal with him as you deem ad
visable
The most prominent member of the
committee was Casey himself the real
culpriAftpca perfunctory search through
quartera occupied by other cadets they
reached Mr Boyds and found nothing to
reward their efforts At that juncture Ca
sey glanced upward at a pile of books ly
ing on some shelves and said Let us look
at that large dictionary
Caseys room was directly opposite that
occupied by Mr Boyd who roomed alone
because of his unpopularity Mr Boyds
room was unguarded and accessible so no
doubt Casey had frequently entered it and
taken money from tho man he now public
ly accused The search took place at noon
when the main body of the corps were at
dinner On Mr Boyds return to his room
he found it filled with cadets whomadly
accused him of the crime White with hor
ror and shame unspeakable he answered
their charges in a way which would have
convinced any judge of human nature that
he was entirely innocent Sinking to his
knees and raising his eyes to heaven he
cried By the memory of my deadJinoth
er I- swear I knew nothing whatever of
this money
But the supposed culprit was in the
hands of Philistines No thought of mercy
impelled them I now quote from a pub
lished account by an eyewitness the scene
later in the day It was a cold sad blus
terless day The air was full of snow and
the cold was bitter Orders were given to
fall into ranks in the area of the bar
racks for undress parade The cadet adju
tant commanded Parade rest Af ter a
pause he continued Cadet captains will
place themselves opposite their respective
company fronts and arrest any man who
leaves the ranks There was an interval
of the most profound stillness Then above
the winds howling came the sound of
tramping feet
Across the broad porch of the barracks
and down the steps came four cadets bear
ing between them a mans form They ad
vanced along the battalions front As
they turned the adjutant raised his right
hand and forthwith the drums and fifes
beat and wailed out in unmelodious and
unearthly harmony the terrible tune of
the Rogues March On they came and
noW I saw affixed to that mans breast a
large white placard and on it the words
Coward Liar Thief The face above
the words was marblo white as the face of
the dead but the wild staring blood red
eyes seemed to wail and shrink in their
horrible misery The four cadets passed
along the full length of tho battalion and
with their victim turned down the slope
beyond the buildings and disappeared
General Cullom was then in command
at West Point On that particular evening
he was returning from tho dock toward
which those heartless cadets had driven
Mr Boyd when he met the young man
face to face
The generals first and natural thought
was that Mr Boyd had dressed himself in
civilians clothes and was stealing off the
post in search of amusement but a second
glance showed him a face full of grief and
shame He took the young man at once to
his own quarters questioned him and
found to his dismay that the cadetsbad
perpetrated a most unprecedented and
cruel outrage General Cullom determined
that the matter should be sifted to the bot
tom
The court of inquiry later instituted by
General Cullom resulted in a verdict of
not guilty In the eyes of the cadets
whose insensate cruelty had warped their
judgment it was simply a Scotch verdict
of not proved and though acquitted
the defendant was thenceforth a disgraced
and dishonored man Exchange
