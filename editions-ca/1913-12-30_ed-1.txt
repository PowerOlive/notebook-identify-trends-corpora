Thai in large quantitiesthis is true is an undoubted fact, ashas often been tested.Some years ago the writer was quitehorrified upon going to the barnyardone afternoon to find a dozen ormore fine hens lying about dead. Inlooking for the cause of this suddenmortality one of the cow's messeswas found to be uneaten, and a closeexamination showed .that the attendant, either through Ignorance or carelessness, had dumped upoiTit a pint ofsalt too much to be relished evenby bossy and after the cattle hadbeen turned into the pasture, thechickens, that had free range, discovered the bucket of bran, and ate fromit freely, and so rapid was the actionof the salt that some hens died buta few feet away. An examination ofthe crops confirmed the suppositionthat it was the heavily salted branthat liad proved fatal, says a writer inthe Farm Progress.That food salted to the human tasteis not, however, injurious or repellent to poultry of nearly all kindsIs proved by the avidity with whichthe latter eat and thrive upon thetable scraps, which include, besidesbread and meat, all kinds of vegetables, and bits of pastry. Close observers contend that chickens, especially, seem to need small quantitiesof salt in their food, and when givena chance, will prefer this to unseasoned grain.What the exact effects of the slightly salted ration might "be on the general health and productiveness of henswas made the subject of experimenttwo or three years ago at the NewYork experiment station.The feeding trial was made upon adozen mature hens, especially to ascertain the approximate limit of thefeeding. For one lot of hens salt wasmixed in the food in increasing quantities, day after day, until it was fedat somewhat more than six-hundredthsof an ounce per fowl, or about onehalf pint per day for 100 hens. Morethan this produced diarrhoea in somewhich disappeared when the excess ofsalt -was withdrawn. v,The test was made at the unproductive time of the year, but an unexpected and gratifying result wasthat double the number of -eggs werelaid by the hens fed on rather oversalted food than by any other dozerfowls fed on unseasoned grain andother rations.GEO.

Toascertain the correctness of this theory a series of experiments was madeby theBureau of Animal Industry ofthe United States Department of Agriculture at .the experimental dairy'farm at Beltsville, Mdi Six cows wereused in the experiment; three werefed a grain ration of corn meal, branand cottonseed meal; the other threewere fed a grain mixed of five partscrushed oats and one port cottonseed,meal. A number of samples of milkfrom the cows fed these rations weresubmitted to various persons in thedairy division and they were askedto indicate their preference. In all50 opinions were passed -on varioussamples. Of these, 16 showed a preference for the 'milk from the cows fedon crushed oats, 25 preferred thatfrom the bran and corn rations, while9 expressed no choice. The resultshows that in these rations, -not onlywas there ho marked difference infavor of the crushed oats as a feedto improve flavor, but, if anything, theration containing bran and corn, wasmore successful in producing a fineflavored milk.mrs.

E-70FARMERS' WELFARED'scussed ByRepresentatives of 25Nations.In connection with the great exposition at Ghent, Belgium, during thepast summer, there was held the regular session of the Tenth International Congress of. Agriculture. Thiswas followed by the Third International Congress of Associations ofAgricultural Women, and the SecondInternational Congress of Housekeeping Instruction. A recent issue of theExperiment Station Record gives aninteresting account of the doings ofthese congresses.The Congress of Agriculture provides an opportunity to the nationsfor a free discussion of the everchanging problems in country life and anexchange of views on the subject.There were twenty-five countries represented at the recent session atGhent, and some very interestingconferences took place, althoughman; of the questions consideredwere of application exclusively 'toEuropean countries rather than tothis country. The United States' delegate to the Congress was Dr. A. C.True, 'of the Office of Experiment Stations of the Department of Agriculture. The main topic selected for discussion in the Congress was rural de-jftopulation. The French representative presented statistics to show thatthe farmer was leaving the farm insuch numbers as to diminish thewheat and beef production of theworld to a considerable degree. Theremedy for the depopulation of farming districts, in his opinion, lay inincreasing attractiveness of rural lie.Considering the closeness of relations between European countries, itis very important that agriculturalmatters concerning all be discussed incongresses of the sort just held. TheUnited States, although k our .cona'i--itions of country life" are differentfrom those in Europe, may learnmuch from these discussions, and especially may see the importance ofstudying agricultural conditions in ajbroad manner, with a 'view toshaprngthe development of our farm1hg9.communities along permanently satisfactory lines.

Theincrease is explained in many ways,but the favorite theory is that the recruits believe that, due to possiblecomplications with Mexico, they willhave some chance of seeing activeservice. When a war threatens, thiscountry can easily enlist 1,000,000men, but, in ordinary times, the dullroutine of garrison life appeals butlittle to the young men of America.HEALS ITCHY ECZEMA.HOBSON'S OINTMENTDR.The constantly itching, burningsensation and other disagreeableforms of eczema, tetter .salt rheum,and skin eruptions promptly curedby Dr. Hobson's Eczema OintmentGeo.

The custom of three sales a'--week, kas gone on uninterruptedgimoe the opening of the season sev-'rs3 weeks ago, during which time alarge amount of the product of Bour"boa as well as .that of adjoiningcomities has gone under the hammerat prices that astonished the mostsanguine, established a record for thelocal market, and eclipses any market1 Central Kentucky, and perhaps intli State.Since the opening of the season3re than a million pounds have beensold. For the same period of lastyear a little more than half of the.amount was disposed of, and the general average of the entire sale forthis season is nine cents higher thanthat of last season.Included in the averages of the local house there has been every gradeof tobacco placed on the floor. Theprices ranged from $1.50 to $42 per 'Jiundred pounds, the latter, the top;prfce, being received at the last salefeefore the holidays. Twenty dollar 'tobacco is not infrequent, this gradeseeming to be in demand.The management of the BourbonTobacco Warehouse Company have innowise attempted to deceive the public by coloring up the house averages"by eliminating the low grades fromthe figures of the general average. Itis said upon good authority that themanagement of many houses in Kentucky are doing this to boost the salesand to make a good showing. Thepractice of putting all grades in theaverage has had the effect of reducing that of the Paris market, but withtkis it is far above any in this section. The figures show that an immenseamount of money has been put in circulation since the opening of the ParS market, and growers who have hadconsignments on the floors are morethan satisfied with the prices received. The producer should look tothe best market to secure the bestprices for his tobacco, and he can dono better than by bringing it toParis."MORRIS-HIGGINS,News of the marriage of Miss Hazel Morris and Mr. Thomas Hteerins.at Terre Haute, Ind., a-few days ago,came as a distinct surprise to thefriends of the couple, although theirengagement was an open secret.The bride is the attractive daughter of Mr. and Mrs. R.

I am willing for the law tcake its course, : n i you can have mbody."Dr. McDonald gave it as his opinionhat Schmidt "is a man of super'ontelligence" and that he has shammed insanity much more cleverlhan an ignorant person could havedone.He also thought it possible that thefour alients of the defense had beendeceived by the accused, and that Dr.Herrman, who examined him for theRoyal Court of Munich, Germany, alsoad been imposed upon by the simulations of Schmidt.Dr. Geo. H. Kirby said he hadfound the prisoner's mind to be working rapidly, but that it had given noindication of. abnormality. In hisODinion Schmidt's mind is rational s'oubtp'l the truth of Schmidt's assertions that he had visions.That the accused had answered allquestions readily and correctly whenhe examined him last October wasHie testimony given by Dr. Allen R.Dieffendorf, another of the State'salienists.

Henry W. Savage issending practically the same companyand exactly the same production inscenery and mechanical effects to theLexington Opera House January 1, 2cnd 3, with special matineee NewYears day and Saturday.Since the performance in Lexington last year, the company has notbeen idle a single week, day or night.The tour led by special train to the!farthermost limits of America andhas included practically every largecity in the United States and Canada,During the summer long engagementswere played in San Francisco and LosAngeles and in the early autumn thecities of the Puget Sound countrywere given a chance of enjoying thesingular play.Last year the critical point of thecity was unanimous in conmmending"Everywoman" not only os a powerfulstage presentation, rich in color andsound but as an appeal to reasonwhich no clear-thinking individual canafford to miss. It was for manyweeks the sole theme in shop and factory and mill and drawing room, andthe many who were unable to secureseats to 'see it last year will welcome this return engagement.Mr. Savage promises an evenstronger portrayal of the salientpoints of the play than last year. Thetwo organizations which were presenting the play in different parts ofthe country then have been united,and in every instance the strongerdelineator of a character was retained for the single company which ispresenting "Everywoman" this year.Thus he has been able to secure anorganization which is particularlyflawless.'The title role is played by ThaisMagrane, a young woman of dramatic force, who combines with her art abeauty of face and figure particularlyilluminating to the role. Miss Magrane played this character in theEastern organization last season, andappeared in it for four months inChicago. She is said to possess aquality that reaches out over thefootlights. She brings to the roleyouth, experience, a delicately shadedexuression and a sure poise.A large symphony orchestra is carried by the company.(26-2t"Peg O' My Heart."A notable attraction is promised forthe patrons of the Ben Ali, Lexington,January 1, 2, 3, in "Peg O' My Heart"the comedy of youth by J.

The Danville Messengerhas been told that som .friends ofthe noted and most belojed evangelist have put a plan on foot to havethe bodies exhumed and brought toDanville for interment, the wish ofBrother Barnes to that effect havingbeen heard expressed a short timebefore his death.No Kentucky evangelist ever accomplished so much good as did this famous old minister. While he wasaffiliated with no particular church,yet his pleadings had the effect ofcausing many to place their names onchurch rolls. With a little organ, heand his daughter, Miss Marie, madesweetest and most appealing musicever heard at an evangelist's meeting.Many of our citizens recall the greatinterest his meetings caused here,and the melodious hymns sung asonly the Barnes' could sing them.DEAFNESS CANNOT BE CUREDBy local applications, as they cannot reach the diseased portions of theear. There is only one way to curedeafness, and that is by constitutional remedies. Deafness is nearlyalways caused by an inflamed condition of the mucous lining of the Eustachian tuhe. When this tube is inflamed ypu have a rumpling sound orimpaired hearing, and when it is entirely closed deafness is the result,and unless thd- inflammation be taken out and this, tube restored to itsnormal condition, hearing will be destroyed forever;-nine cases out often are caused by Catarrh, which isnothing but an inflamed condition ofthe mucous surfaces.We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of deafness (causedby citarrh) that cannot be cured byHall's Catarrh Cure.Send for cir-CUlai free,F.
