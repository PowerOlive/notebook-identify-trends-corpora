psk animals are forPorto Rico and will not be unloadeduntil they reach thereMovements of troops will be veryrapid from this time Gen Miles is astrong believer in the idea of plentyof men He lias from the start favored preparations to overpower theSpaniards with numbers His plansfor Porto Rico contemplate an armyof 25000 to occupy that island 95 mileslong and 35 miles wide It is probable however that Gen Miles willstart from Santiago with a force of 15000 men expecting- the 10000 additional to follow as soon as the transports can be sent back for themIt will be necessary to draw on thecamps in this country for 25000 mento make up the army which Gen Milesdeems sufficient for Porto Rico andleave enough troops with Gen Shafterfor further operations in SantiagoThis widening of the field

immediately that the flagshipMaria Teresa was getting a terrible baptism of fire It was frightful The Texas and the Brooklynwere just riddling her and in 15 minTites I saw she was on fire The Iowaand Oregon were firing on the Oqeundo and as yet I had not been badlyhit The Brooklyn was a half milecloser to us than any other ship and Idetermined to try and ram her so thatthe Colon and Oquendo could get awayand I started for her She was a goodmark with her big broadside and as Istarted I thought surely Iwould get her but she hadevidently seen us and veryquickly she turned about and makinga short circuit came at our port sideso that I thought she would ram us Imoved in toward shore so that I couldavoid her and then I saw that theOquendo had gone ashore also hersteam pipes evidently having beensevered by a shell The manoueverof the Brooklyn was beautiful Weopened a rapid fire at her with all ourbig guns but she returned it with terrible effect The Oregon also hit usseveral times but the Brooklynsbroadside crashing into our superstructure simply terrorized the menWe worked all our guns at her at onetime and I dont see how she escaped us She simply drove us into shore at one time fighting us at1100 yards One shell went along- theentire gun deck killing half the men-on it and wounding nearly all the restA shell from the Oregon hit the superstructure and it was then that themen were wounded and knowing wecould not get away I struck the flagand started for the beachThe Mines Ordered RemovedWashington July 13 The secretary of war has ordered the removalof all the submarine

being-projected to extend outward fromthe shore for a distance of four and ahalf miles and it has been under construction for more than a year Thework has been attended with greatdifficulty About six weeks ago therewas an explosion of gas in the shoreend of the big hole which killed eightmen and injured a number of othersSoon afterward a large pocket ofquicksand was struck and work wasstopped for some time The contractors then asked for permission todeflect the course of the tunnel fromthe route fixed by the city engineersbut was refused Work was finallyresumed and had progressed uneventfully until Monday evening- when thislatest and most horrible accidentcameThe explosion occurred at a few minutes before 7 oclock Monday eveningbut nobody will ever be able to tellwhat caused it or how it happenedfor every witness is dead and the bodies of all are lying- where they fell6000 feet out under the lake Theonly man in the tuunel who escapeddeath is Con ODonnell a lock tenderwho was stationed 3700 feet from theshoreHe heard the explosion or series ofexplosions He says there were ten ofthe shocks and the concussion wassomething- terrible for it threw himoff his feet and for hours he was insuch a dazed condition that he couldscarcely remember what had happened He finally groped his way outand told what had occurredTwo men Patrick Vonseer and Martin McCauley were the first to venture in the tunnel after the accidentoccurred They made their way to alock 6200 feet from the shore but werethere overcome by the gas and fell tothe floor When they failed toreturn a young man named JamesClements son of one of the menwho was killed and who was employedas a mule driver went to their rescueHe found them almost unconsciouslying over a mule cart and succeededin helping them to the wTell at theshore end of the tunnel The wouldbe rescuers say that all the lightswere out beyond the 5000 feet lockand that they could not go anyfurtherA second rescuing party was madeup of Patrick Gaytons Mike McGauley Dan Rogers Barney Hughes andEd Corbett It failed utterly in accomplishing anything as the tunnelwas filled with foul gas and smoke Inan interview Ed Corbett said Whenwe got out 5100 feet we foundthe electric lights were not burning from there on out Thegas and smoke were terrible We hadwet handkerchiefs over our noses andmouths and went 200 feet further intothe pitchy darkness but the gas andsmoke almost overcame us and we wereforced to return Nothing can be accomplished in the way of getting thebodies until the tunnel is lighted andthe sulphur gas and smoke are clearedout It is sure death to try to reachthe bodies now As far out as we gotthe base of the tunnel was covered tothe depth of a foot with substance resembling snow in its appearanceSHAFTERS

dontprofess to say though I dont knovwhat it will do to the Spaniards Hut ilis doing some funny things to usAmericans anywayWhen 1 was on my way down hereI met a man on the train met him inthe smoking room where he was sitting reading- a New Orleans paper 01course we began to talk Avar and 1asked him what JSTew Orleans people hadto sayOh theyre ready for a fight hesaid just as ready to fight under thestars and snipes to day as they were tofight again it 35 years ago Ive seensome pretty strange things since thiswar broke out but when T was down inXew Orleans a week ago I saw something that beat all the rest for beingqueerThere was a regiment of southernvolunteers expected to pass through thecity and it seemed as if the whole population men women and children hadturned out to see em go through In away it was a prettj sad experience tothe old timers who remembered thewar sad because it brought back thememory of privations and terror andheartaches of those days When thefirst company appeared in their UnitedStates army uniforms it might havebeen the signal for a wave of bitternessHut it wasnt The crowd cheered theofficers cheered five flag and cheeredthe ranksThat wasnt the strange part of itthough Most of the men as T say worethe regular army uniform A few ofthvm were not fully equipped havingbeen ordered out in a hurry but thegeneral effect was all right Suddenlyhowever a company came along andupon my soul I rubbed my eyes andlooked twice to see if I wasnt dreaming Every man of them wore an oldconfederate uniform The crowd Avasas if every man of them had beenstruck dumb Then in a second itbroke into a yell that made the buildings rockThe man stopped a minute andpufFed at his cigar before he Avent onIt seems thai the company hadntbeen able to get regular army uniformsbefore they started so they had beggedand borrowed a Jot of old confederateones and had come right along Theydidnt mean to be going back to oldprejudices in doing that T dont

trim off all that dves notbelong to it such as horns tail bonessinews and meat then spread the hideout Ipftving no wrinkles in it and beingcareful to get legs and heads spread sothat salt can be sprinkled on themsays the Nebraska Farmer Thensprinkle salt evenly and freely on everyXart of the hide putting on about threegallons of salt on a large hide audsmaller ones in proportion and neverspread hides in the sunHides taken care of in this mannerafter hing three or four days in saltcan be shipped almost any distance andin anj kind of weather and go throughin good condition and with very littleif any shrinkageFor shipping always tie your hidesone in a bundle as they often becomeloose in transportation and when morethan one hide is tied in a bundle therailroads deliver the proper number ofbundles but not always the propernumber of hides Always write theperson to whom you ship notifyinghim the date you shipped givingweights and number and statingwhether horse or beef hides All ofthis will be very little trouble and willsave a great deal of trouble and possible mistakesSheen for Clearing1 LandWherever woodland is cleared afiock of sheep is extremely valuabie tokeep the cleared soil from being overgrown with the bushes weeds andshrubs which usually come up in following years It is desirable to get thecleared land in grass as soon as possible When it is once seeded down itmay be pastured with sheep all throughthe summer not only without injuringthe grass but positively benefiting itas the sheep will devote most of theirtime to trimming down the bushes andeating the leaves which shade the landTo make more thorough destruction ofthe shrubbery an excess of sheepshould be put in the cleared lot andthese must be fed some grain so as tomake their browse diet

milk thenext best feed is something that willproduce the most milk in the animalthat is bran But bran is very pooron fats He has to add the necessaryfat and he can obtain that with linseed or corn To

whose facewhile it was decidedly pleasant to lookat bore witness that she was a sisterDf the clinging vine variety sadlydevoid of strong purpose or will powerShe was one of those atoms of womanhood whom even a woman is inclined tcembrace upon the shortest acquaintance and the men well she was of astyle that is simply irresistible to thesterner sexThe calm woman smiled half amusedlyas she watched her bright faeethe very picture of innocence and sweetness Suddenly the calm womanfrowned and drew herself together withthe faintest possible shudder Foithere on the white pique skirt of heipretty neighbor was a small greenworm humping its way across the immaculate surface She leaned forwardintent upon informing the young girlof the monsters presence but drewback again realizing the xossible results If there was one thing that thecalm woman loathed and abominated itwas worms in general and green onesin particular If she called the attention of the shy little woman oppositeher to the fact that she was at that moment being traversed by a worm thegirl would scream of course and whiskthe objectionable reptile off her owrskirts on to those- of her informantThe calm woman who was rapidljlosing her calmness under the nervousstrain inspired by the sight of theworm decided she would nor- risk interference All the- way downtown shewatched the hideous thing a movingblot upon her neighbors immaculateapparel She felt for the girl but darednot tell her of her predicament Meanwhile the girl remained in blissful ignorance At length the green streakmoved up to the girls gloved handwhich reposed in her lap Fearing lestthe creature should crawl up her sleevethe erstwhile calm woman who pridedherself upon her self possession underordinary and even sometimes extraordinary circumstances leaned forwardand said almost hystericallyI beg 3our pardon but but thereis a worm on your handThen she drew away shudderingly scthat she would be safe from the anticipated result of the girls excitementAAThat was the calm womans surpriseto see the weak sister with scarcely achange of feature pluck the worm fromher glove with her other ungloved handand as the car came to a standstill dropit gently to the street Then she turnedto the calm woman and sweetly thankedher Chicago Inter OceanHELPS FOR HOUSEKEEPERSSome Items of Information AboutVarious Small Matters inthe HomeMuch better
