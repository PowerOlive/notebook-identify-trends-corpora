PHOENIX HOTEL CASE
ENDS IN FAYETTE COURT.
The Phoenx Hotel bird case which
has attracted attention throughout
State was finally decided yesterday
when in the Fayette Circuit Court a
fine of $380 and costs on the four in
dictments. The caso was first tried in
the Fayette County Court in Novem
ber, 1912, and a fine of $600 was im
posed on the Phoenix Hotel Company.
The case was appealed to the Circuit
Court and a fine of $150 was imposed
by the verdict of the jury trying the
case. Then the case was taken to the
Court of Appeals and in January, 1913,
the decision of the lower court was
reversed. On one indictment the
company was again tried and after a
verdict of guilty the case was again
carried to the Appellate Court, which
again reversed the decision of the
lower court. At the trial yesterday a
plea of guilty was entered and the fine
stated above was imposed. The case
has been of much interest throughout
the State. The Phoenix Hotel Com
pany was indicted, at the November,
1912, term of the Fayette Circuit
Court for selling quail, in violation oc
the State law. The indictments were
the result of an investigation by State
Agent Quincy Ward, of the Fish and
Game Commission, who has been vig
orous in his prosecution of the case.
