We all know the "story of Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr.
Garnegie, or Schwab, or any of our other great fortune
builders. They began by PUTTING THEIR MONEY
IN THE BANK. Not because they had too much
oh. no! They wanted that money in the bank so it
would be safe and so it would be there to grasp the
first good BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. None of
them dabbled in get-rich-quick schemes peddled
around by smooth strangers.

and contented as a little child, a won
derful translation from this life to a
