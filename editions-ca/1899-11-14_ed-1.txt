Ladysmiths latest dateis November 9 While nothing averseis heard from the latter point andconfidence is felt in Gen Whites ability previous experience having- shownthat tne Boer artillery is not very effective it is beginning to prove thatthe acquisition of artillery which hasdestroyed the former mouility of theBoer forces has also failed to givethem any compensating advantageOn the contrar3r the reverse is the caseIt is held here that if the Boers hadnot been hampered by the transport ofheavy guns and their rescue from tightplaces Gen Joubert might ere thishave been in Pieterinaritzburg Unless the Boer heavy artilleryjustifies itself by reducingLadysmith it will again hamper himin the eventual retreat from Natalwhen Gen Buller sends the relievingforce It is believed that the Boer retreat will be made over the Drakensburg range into the Zoutpansberg district where every preparation for provisioning and maintaining the Boersis said to have been made for the laststand and where it will be difficult todislodge them Already it is rumoredthat they are in straits for food aroundLadysnith and may therefore beobliged to abandon the siegeDispatches from Estcourt say it haabeen ascertained that the British havelaid concrete beds for firing thelyddite naval guns showing that thereis no foundation for the fear that thelyddite ammunition at Ladysmith hasbeen exhausted It is also reportedfrom the same quarter that some fireshave been seen in Lad7smith indicating that the Boer bombardment hasbeen to some extent effective Aspecial dispatch from Cape Town confirms the earlier report that it wasGen Buller who ordered the Britishevacuation of Stormberg and Naauwpoort as he considered the frontierline too weak and too much extendedIt is understood however thatNaauwpoort will be occupied again assoon as the a vance from Queenstownis ordered Strong bids are beingmade by the Boers for the support ofthe Cape Dutch but without much success although it is believed that theDutch farmers especially in Picquetberg district are armed with Mausersand are watching the course of eventsbefore joining the Boers From Stormberg it is reported that the Free Slateforces are working slowly towardDordrecht With a view of attackingQueenstown and cutting off the townsin the northern districts of Cape Colony The wounded are recovering ina remarkable manner The Mauserwounds are small and heal rapidlyMany of the wounded apply for permission to return to the frontThe fact that the latest two officialdispatches were received from Gen SirForestier Walker and not from GenBuller seems to indicate that the latter may have already left Cape TownA Brussels telegram asserts that hehas actually reached Durban This iscertainly premature but he may havestarted-An

He has held a mot difficult position and I think he has handled it well Of course he could haveslashed in and laid the islands wastewith fire and sword but to do thiswithout an effort first to show the natives that the United States wished togive them a fair just and liberal government would have forever preventedAmerican relations and it would havebecome a question of exterminationand recolonization The islands aretoo far away for sush a policy evenif humanity and self interest did notforbidIn my opinion a force of 75000 to100000 men is needed to promptly andsuccessfully settle this This forcefill have to be retained until tnose whoare friendly and take the oath of allegiance to the United States are strongenough to protect themselves otherwise the natives will come down

to get gold and now Lm alone inthe world You havent told me howmy brother died When was thatThe mate gave him all the detaisthis time truthfully for he had heardthem all at Merrivale When he hadfinished Capt Scott saidDid you never hear Tom speak orme Why did he never write When 1left the ship in your charge I gave youa letter to mail to him telling him thatI vvas going up in Alaska after

have notid it but forhis own great grief but he managed tosayAll straight capnToms father was silent a momentand Obed Riders thoughts were anything but pleasant His braiu was in awhirl and he feared that any momenthis tongue might betray him to the manhe had wronged so deeply He was athis wits end for the best course topursue when suddenly his companionsettled the matter at once by exclaimingI have only one thing lef to live fornow I have more money than I knowwhat to do with and Ill see that mypoor boy is buried properly in FriscoThen Ill do the square thing by everybody that was good to him there andthenHe broke off suddenly and set histeeth hardThen Ill put 20000 reward up forthe wretch who killed himEider shuddered involuntarily as thecaptain spoke but he made no replyseemed to

NOVEMBER W 1899are that theyll go east at once and Ican work my little scheme withoutanyone to hinder me Perhaps its thebest thing after all that I met him Ifthe youngster is dead the old man willnever hear what I told abour him unless he goes to Merrivale and be aintlikely to go there now he has no folksthere He wont go near no shippingfirms to hear it not if hes richHe was beginning to feel more easy inhis mind when he was interrupted byCapt Scott who saidWhat brought you out here ItiderO I got the gold fever iike the restGoing to the Klondike regionYes I suppose soTake my advice and doui Its onCanadian ground and you cant do sowell Ill give you a tip that is wortha fortune to you Go to the Copper riverand you wont regret it Ill give youthe lay of the ground and a note to aGd chum there who will set you rightHow are you fixed for moneyKider hesitated Scoundrel as he washe could not find his tongue for a moment in reply and the miner saved himthe trouble by addingNever mind Kider I see how it isbut you neednt be bashful 111 see thatyou have enough to start in with thebest of them A good outfit is half thebattle up there and you want ail thegrub you can take in Im going tomake a rush for that steamer now hefur1 I gt t left Ill see you again ifthere is time before the boat leaves Iguess my partner will go toHe wrung Riders hand heartily disappeared into his tent and came outwith a plump bag of gold which lie laidby Riders side without further comment then started for the beach withlong swinging strides that took himto the waters edge in very few moments while the mate looked at thebag with glistening eyes and said tohimselfHes got a heart big as an ox butIm in too deep to back out now and Illneed all I can get to keen out of hisclutches if he ever finds out the truthThe steamer sailed the followingmorning but before he left the returning miner saw that Kider wanted fornothing He gave him the benefit ofhis experience in the wilderness madea list of the necessary articles of out-lit and paid a penniless unfortunate tolock after t he mate and his horses untilthe former was able to do it himselfTbe return voyage went well for twodays then the steamer broke down andit was nearly a week before she wasable to proceed The following nighshe ran on a small island causing another weeks delay It was over threeweeks before Capt Scott reached SatFrancisco and was r iven to the dockwhere the Seabird still layOld Capt Coffin was on deck arJToms father accosted him at onceIs this Capt Seth CoffinThats my nameWell my name is Scott My soncame out with you andWhat Are you his father interrupted the old skipper Yes I can seethe look Give us your flipper Wonthe be disappointed Its too badHis visitors weather beaten faceturned ghastly pale and he gaspedDisappointed What do you meanIs he notAboard Xo confound it he started up north a week or ten days agoCHAPTEK VIGREEN TURNS DETECTIVEWhen Tom Scott opened his eyes toan understanding of what was passing around him he gazed curiousaround his poorly furnished roomThen as his eyes fell upon the secondmate of the Seabird reading by the window he said in a faint whisperMr GreenDown went the paper and the honest sailor hastened to his side exclaiminglies come to at last You mustntask any questions Mr Scott The doctor gave me my orders just now Youllbe all right in a day or twoBut where amBelay was the firm response asthe watcher placed his broad handgently on Toms mouth I aint going against orders Lay right still anddont talk Here take this stuff Youwas to have it as soon as you got yourreckoningAs he spoke he held a glass to Tomslips with one hand raising the patienttenderly with the other with a deftness that told of considerable practiceTom was too weak to resist and ilowed the medicineas he was bid Thenhe was about to try to speak againwhen his nurse raised his hand warningly Tom would have made anothereffort but he felt an overpoweringsense of drowsiness and a momentlater he was forced to yield Hishead fell back and he dropped into arestful slumberWhen he again awoke the secondmate was dozing in his chair Tomshead was clear now and he feltstronger As he watched the sleepingman the events of the fateful nightbegan to come back to him and as heremembered hLs loss he could not helpmuttering an exclamation of despairOjt OilJ -It was the watcher who replied anas he spoke he came quicklj to thebedside sayingI must have dropped off a minuteBow do you feel nowPretty weak was the faint response and Im hungryGood Youll do Youll be allright in a week Ill soon fix thatAs he spoke a portly man entered theroom and the sailor addedHeres the doctor now Ill leavehim to see you while I run down to thevessel and tell Capn Coffin youre allright aloftWhen the doctor left Tom he saidbrisklyYou are all right now young manEat all you want and youll be able totravel in a week or two Its only weakness now and that is soon mendedHe proved a reliable prophet andTom fi it his strength return each dayIn a day cr two he was out and at theexpiration of the week he felt perfectlywell with the exception of a slightlanguor which still remainedHe said nothing about the loss of thepapers at first but when he learnedfrom Capt Coffin how the second matehad offered to spend his hard earnedsavings and give up his cherished planof going to the mines he determined tomake him his confidant and offer toshare with him if they could find theparties to whom he had been directedAfter carefully thinking the matterover he was convinced that the robberwould probably place no reliance on therude will even if he took the troubleto read it It was more than probablethat he had thrown both papers awaywhen he rifled the belt paying attention only to the tidy sum he had se- jcured by his crimeIn this case it would only be necessary to find the old miners friends andtell the truth to which the second matecould certify There was another precaution too which might be taken andthat was to obtain a sworn statementfrom the captain of the Seabird as tothe identity of both Tom and the second officer together with the fact thatJohn Avery was the formers roommateand had died at seaTom easilv obtained this in writingand he then told his secret to Greenwho listened in open mouthed amazement but with a kindling face thatshowed he had no doubt of tiie absolutetruth of what he heardNow concluded Tom thats thewhole story It may be a wild goosechase but there it is Will you go inwith me and share and share alike Iknow the papers by heart and they areprobably lost so we will be all rightWhat do you saySay Why what would any mansay Im with vou as long as I have adrop of blood left Of course Ill gobut 1 have hanged little monDont talk money to me interrupted Tom quickly I know what you didfor me before you knew I had a cent Ihave 4000 left and the first thing is foryou to take half of it Ill feel saferthenDont you think anyone knew youhad them papers asked his new comrade after awhile Sure you nevermentioned them or showed themSure replied Tom I did not mention them to a single person and theymkNo he started up north a week or tendays agowere never out of the belt except when1 was looking at them alone by myselfWas the money you lost in the belttooYes no come to think of it I had itin my pocket that night It was luckyI put the most of it in the safe thatvery dayWhat made vou do thatCapt Coffin advised ms to repliedTom a little surprised at the persistency of his friends questioning Whydo you askBecause was the thoughtful replyIm figuring up how many folks couldpossibly have seen those papersI tell youBelay a bit broke in Green Letme finish my calculation Two headsare bettern one The old man gave thepaperstoyou aboard ship in your stateroomTom nodded and the other went onNow who could have seen themwhen they was in jour room Letscount up The capn the mate and meis the only ones that had any chancecause no one else is allowed in thecabin beside the cook The cook wentto sea long ago which he wouldnt doneif he had any money to buy rum norany such papers as them in his pocketWe know Capn Coffin didnt slug youfor he aint that kind and if he was hewouldnt have told you to put yourmoney in the safe and felt so bad overyour hurtWhat are you driving at askedTom rather amused at the businesslikeway in which the sailor was checkingoff his points on the ends of his fingersThen theres the mateGreen paused and looked triumphantly at TomThe mates room was next to yournHe might have seen them He was inhis room when you came out and saidthe old man was dying He skipped outthe same day you was hurt and give nonotice He never come nigh you at allHeWhat do you mean demandedTom starting to his feet as for the firsttime the others meaning began todawn upon himHe hated you like poison andYes Yes I see it all cried Tomclenching his fists I see why he leftso sudden h 1 had a ticket in mypocket by an excursion train for Seattle It was only good that day He isthe robber I could swear to it Howdid you come to think of it so quickCause the chap that did it wouldhave taken your money out of yourpocket and lit out He wouldnt havitook no chances hunting for a belt unless he knew there was one there I seeit must be some one that knew of thepapeTs and then the rest was easjNow come down aboard and well see ifwe cant prove itTom followed him to th Seabird andthey soon stood in the mates stateroomSee hereThe second officer pointed as he spoketo a narrow crack in the partition whichseparated it from Toms room It needed but a glance to show that it hadbeen recently ealargedThats what did the business hecontinued and hes off for that goldmine Hes got a big start and whatsto prevent his passing himself off as MrTom Scott on those peopleHe couldnt do that exclaimedTomWhy not Was there any description of you in the paper the old mangave you How are they to knowBut Ive got a statement in mypocket from Capt Coffin telling who weare and all about it insisted TomWhat good is that when the mate ison the spot perhaps with his documents and how can you make anyonebelieve you are the right chap hookhere Scott theres only one thing todo Weve got to go after that son of asea cook and take the law in our ownhands Something will turn up to helpus out After all I dont know but thatthere is something in what vou sav Allhe could tell about Avery was what hesaw on board the vessel He nevertalked any with him and dont knowanything about his family or businessNow I dare say the old chap told you agood manv things about himself didntheYes replied Tom ragt rly he toldme all about his family and I can soonconvince anyone that the mate is lyingif he claims to be me Ive got the captains statement you know sworn obefore a justice of Hie peace and all witnessed The mate will have a hard timeto get round thatMebbe so was the doubtful replybut its a wild country where weregoing and I dont believe papers will beof mm account there Were two toone anyhow and if we overhaul therascal we shall find some way to getsquare with himThe sooner we start the betterthen decided Tom Come on lets beoff and see about it at onceIt did not take the two friends longtomake their simple preparations Themoney remaining in the captains safewas equally divided between them andworn in belts Tickets to Seattle wereprocured and

remember it as if it were yesterday I was sitting in my oftice one aiteruoon about lulf asleep when an oldMexican interrupted my thoughts witha servile Buenss tardea senorT looked around half expecting tosee a seller of lottery tickets but I waimistaken The man before me was veryancient in appearance Deep wrinkleswere in his face and his hair was snowywhite His clothing was neat andclean and he s aemed to have the manner of an hasendado j eon And so itprovedUpon my invitation he came in satdown not however without a numberof profuse apologies Then he told nilstory He remembered me he

hadbeen to him After singing my praistsfor a time he got to the pith of his taleile knew where there was a buriedtreasure Yes ha remembered thatmany many years ago it had beepburied during the vrars He did nQtdare touch it himself as it was guarde iby spirits but the senor could get it hrthought If so the senor might be willing to give him a part of it for the informationAt first I didnt take much stock idthe story but gradually under the influence of the old mans impressive ardapparently truthful statement I begtnto get interested His story was loigand rambling but the point insistedupon was that the treasure was therebeyond the shadow of a doubt As I hadbusiness that necessitated my visitingthat part of the country in which hesaid the treasure was located I agreedfinally to take the old man along Soa few dajs after I found myself onhorseback at Oaxaca witn the Mexicanas my guideWhen we started out to find thetreasure the old man suddenly got ascared streak on him and refused tcgive me full directions He would nutlead me to the spot but hung behindand spoke seldom Senor will have tofind it himself I do not know where itis but and he would hesitate a moment it might be in this directionThen he would point in a certain direction I kept going in this direction foxsome time Finally I got discouragedand had a notion to turn backPerhaps the senor might turn tothe right and go over that hill theold man then said I turned and kepton until we came to a broad field HereI stoppedThe treasure might be in a fieldnear a hill under a big stone returnedhe again No more would he saj 1then rode around the field looking fora stone 1 soon found one near a bigtree The stone was too heavy to moveso I called on the old man to help meXot a bit of it The senor can do aahe pleases he said I soon found however that the stone although verylarge was balanced on another so that1 could move it A little digging underone side soon brought to light a boxwhich when broken open showed alarge amount of gold and silver coinsSure enough the old man was right Iput them in a sack hoisted them on myhore and came back on foot to townNow here is where I made my mistake As the coins were ancient I wasafraid to dispose of them as one halfof a buried treasure you know goesto the owner of the lano on which it isfound 1 sounded an old Mexican whowas a sort of a banker and he agreed

ButProfited Little by HisDisco veryI never told you about tht zAiridtreasure I found did 1 said an oldresident as he leaned back n his chairreflectively It was a long time agobut I remember it as if it were yestfe rday I was sitting in my oliiee one alternoon about hilf asleep when an oidMexican interrupted my thoughts witha servile Buenss tardea senorI looked around half expecting tosee a seller of lottery tickets but I wtsmistaken The man before me was veryancient in appearance Deep wrinkleswire in his face and his hair was snowywhite His clothing was neat andclean and he seemed to have the manner of an hasendado j eon And so ilprovedUpon my invitation he came in satdown not however without a numberDf profuse apologies Then he told hilstory He remembered me he said onaccount of a visit 1 had made into tleinterior of Oaxaca seeral years before1 had given him a peso for guiding me apart of the way through the mountainHe had never forgotten how kind 1 hadbeen to him After singing my praisesfor a time he got to the pith of his talelie knew where there was a buriedtreasure Yes ha remembered thatmany many years ago it had bee aburied during the Iran He did nctdare touch it himself as it was guarde jby spirits but the senor could get it bfthought If so the senor might be willing to give him a part of it for the informationAt first I didnt take much stock jdthe story but gradually under the influence of the old mans impressive andapparently truthful statement I begsuto get interested His stor3r was lotgand rambling but the point insistedupon was that the treasure was therebeyond the shadow of a doubt As I hadbusiness that necessitated my visitingthat part of the country in which hesaid the treasure was located I agreedfinally to take the old man along Soa few das after I found myself onhorseback at Oaxaca witn the Mexicanas my guideWhen we started out to find thetreasure the old man suddenly got ascared streak on him and refused tcgive me full directions He would notlead me to the spot but hung behindand spoke seldom Senor will have tofind it himself I do not know where itis but and he would hesitate a moment it might be in this directionThen he would point in a certain direction I kept going in this direction foisome time Finally I got discouragedand had a notion to turn backPerhaps the senor might turn tothe right and go over that hill theold man then said I turned and kepton until we came to a broad field HereI stoppedThe treasure might be in a fieldnear a hill under a big stone returnedhe again No more would he say Ithen rode around the field looking foia stone I soon found one near a bigtree The stone was too heavy to moveso I called on the old man to help meXot a bit of it The senor can do aahe pleasrs he said I soon found however that the stone although verylarge was balanced on another so that1 could move it A little digging underone side soon brought to light a boxwhich when broken open showed alarge amount of gold and silver coinsSure enough the old man was right Iput them in a sack hoisted them on myhorse and came back on foot to townNow here is where I made my mistake As the coins were ancient I wagafraid to dispose of them as one ballof a buried treasure you know goesto the owner nf tbe lanrt on which it isfound I sounded an old Mexican whowas a sort of a banker and he agreed tcdispose of the coins for a small percentage After he got the money thoughhe changed his mind and kept aboutthree fourths under the threat of exposing me The result was I got about1500 out of the deal one third of whichI gave to the old man Mexican TwoRepublicsA HUMAN FAILINGaturnl Ttesnlt of the Efforts of aSearcher After Statisticsoh the HaceAn old gentleman evidently a gatheter of statistics but with a kindly facewhich

made a hasty search of hiapockets and said Why so 1 did andI hadnt missed it holding out an eageihandThe old man slowly drew forth anotebook and said I thought so Hethen took the name and address of
