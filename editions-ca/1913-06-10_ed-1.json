Health Exhibit for Many Cities.
At a meeting of the Kentucky Tu
berculosis Commission, held in Frank
fort last week, final arangements were
made for taking over the Health Ex
hibit Car, which was run to a great
many towns in the State a year ago.
The car is now being altered, and a
new exhibit is being installed. In the
course of teri days the car will start on
another trip through Kentucky. The
Commission hopes to keep the car on
the road at least two years and will
reach, if possible, all the available
points in the State.
A committee of three was appointed
to meet at the Capitol next Monday,
and engage one or more representa
tives to travel with the car and ex
plain the exhibit.
Waste Money at the Normal School.
In a report filed with Gov. McCreary
State Inspector and Examiner Good
paster charges recklessnes and extrav
agance in the expenditure- of money
appropriated by the State for the East
ern Kentucky Normal School at Rich
mond. The report says that mnch of
the money has been spent with no
hope of return in the form of a benefit
to the students.
The report sets out in detail all of
the money spent by the institution
in 1913. A recapitulation of the lia
bilities shows that the institution now
owes 98,029.08, with $28,747.10 avail
able assets.
Inspector and Examiner Goodpaster
says that a conservative estimate of
the expenses of the institution fftm
March 31 to June 30, the end of the fis
cal year, is $12,500, which added to the
net liabilities of March 31, makes a to
tal indebtedness of the institution on
June 30 of $81,781.98.

JOHN J. CONNELLY,

Members of Congres have little to
do in connection with the filling of
fourth-class postoffices.
Civil Service examinations will be
held for the filling of each fourth class
office, and these examinations will be
open to all, including the present post
masters. It would not appear from the copy
of the Civil Service Commission's in
structions to applicants for the fourth
class postmaster examinations that
tests are very severe, and yet, experi
enece' shows that there are not a few
who fail to pass. The subjects qov
ered by the examinations and the
credits given are:
(1) Elementary arithmetic and ac
counts (simple tests in addition, sub
traction, multiplication, and division
of whole numbers, common and deci
mal fractions and statements of a
postmaster's accounts), 40 credits.
(2) Penmanship (the legibility, neat
ness, and general appearance of the
competitor's handwriting in subject
of letter writing) ten credits.
(3) Letter writing (a letter of not
less than 125 words on one of two sub
jects furnished) ten credits.
(4) Copying manuscript addresses
(a simple test in copying accurately
addresses given) ten credits.
(5) Facilities for transacting postal
business (based on the location of
the postoffice site, the convenience of
office arrangements, etc.) thirty cred
its; total 100 credits.
'The examination in the first subject
consists of five questions along the
following lines.
In question one the competitor is
given eight whole numbers to add. and
from their sum he is required to sub
tract another given whole number.
In question 2 the competitor is given
the value of stamps canceled at a cer
tain postoffice, the amount of money
received for newspaper and periodical
postage, and from the sale of waste
paper, twine, etc.; also the box rents
collected. He is required to enter the
figures in a given lorm,and to com
pute the salary of the postmaster
for the quarter in accordance with
. the directions given in the form.
Question 3 consists of multiplication
tion and division of decimals, and also
the reduction of a fraction to a deci
mal. Question 4 is a practical application
of measurements, such as finding how
many postoffice boxes of a given size
can be put in a certain space, or how
many yards of linoleum of a given
width are required to cover a floor of a
given size.
In question 5 the competitor is given
the amount and fee of each money
order issued and the amount of each
money order paid at a given postoffice
for a certain month. From this data
he is to make a statement of the post
master's account will the government
in a prescribed form and balance the
statement.
All persons securing an average of
70 will get their names on the eligible
list, and from the three highest the
Postmaster General wil select a post
master. In the case of persons honor
ably discharged from the military or
naval service by reason of disability
from wounds received or sickness in
curred in the line of duty, an average
