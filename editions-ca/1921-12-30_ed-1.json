IF WOMEN ONLY KNEW
What a Heap of Happiness It
Would Bring to Paris Homes
Hard- to do work with an aching
back.
Brings you hours of misery at
leisure or at work.
If woman only knew the cause
that , -
Backache pains often come from
weak kidneys;
'Twould save much needless woe.
Doan's Kidney Pills are for weak
kidneys.
Read what a Paris citizen says:
Mrs. J. A. Hughes, 124 Tenth St.,
ays: "We have used Doan's Kidney
Pills in our home and they always
give the best of results. I used them
recently when my kidneys were out
of order and I had a weak feeling
across my back.. Doan's relieved the
trouble at once. I felt tired and
nervous all the time and not much
like doing any kind of work. I seat
to Varden & Son's Drug Store aid
got a couple boxes of Doan's Kidney
Pills. I began using them and they
soon cured the trouble so I -hare
never been bothered since. I take
pleasure in recommending Doan's
Kidney Pills.'
Price 60c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mrs. Hughes had. Foster-Milbum
