Concrete Silos o! Great Value.
Acting under the direction of Direc
tor M. A. Scovell, of the Kentucky
Agricltural Experiraen testation, A. J.
Reed, the dairy specialist, has just
published the following bulletin con
cerning the silo and its value to the
dairyman :
"During the peason of 1911 the Col
lege of Agriculture of the State Uni
versity, of Kentucky, in co-operation
with the dairy division of the United
States Department of Agriculture, has
been active in promoting the building
of silos and carrying on other dairy ex
tension work throughout the State.
"Seven concrete silos were built and
seven hume-made silos set up, and re
pairs were made in several other cases.
In addition fifteen other siloa of various
types were set up under the direction
of the dairy division.
"All the silos proved satisfactory
and especially valuable during the.past
severe winter. Everyone who built a
silo has expressed himself as well
pleased with it, and many intend to
build additional silos this summer.
More concrete silos are being built this
season than last and they are proving
economical to build, many farmers pre
ferring them to the wooden types. A
12x32 foot concrete silo was built at
Lebanon last year for a cash outlay of
less than 5150. At Somerset a concrete
silo 16x40 was built at a total cost of
$400.
It is expected that twenty-five or
more concrete silos will have heen built
by the end of this season. About
twentv of the wooden types are being
built under the supervision of the
dairy division, and in some cases have
resulted in a saving of S50 tojj5100 each
tothe farmer. Farmers are availing
themselves of this opportunity as evi
denced by the great number of inquir
ies that are coming in all the time.
"The activity of the dairy extenbion
work has not been confined to silo
building alone, but plans have been
furnisned for a number of dairy barns.
Five new barns were built complete
last ear, and seven were replanneri
and rebuilt, being changed from un
sanitary, inconvenient arrangements
to cleat) convenient barns. In each
case the supeivisor visited the farm
and made individual plana using exist
ing conditions to the bpst advantage
with the least expenditure of money.
Just now there are five dairy barns
being built and as many more being
remodeled. Old tobacco barns are
readily converted into dairies without
much, expense. The swing" stanchions
are generally used and concrete gut
ters and mangers are installed in al
most every case. Where .bedding is
readily secured concrete floors are also
used. In some cases cork brick or cre
osote blocks are used on the platform
where the cows stand. In 1911 three
new milk houses were built and plans
for five others that are being built now
were made." In connection with
the construction work, individual rec
ords are kept of 150 cows in eight diff
erent dairies. In one dairy of twenty
five cows it was found that the entire
pn fit w s $C42 in one year, the best
cow jiJdinir only 24 pounds of butter
fat, and the average being 200 nounds
anece. One cow yielded 105 pounds
of butter fat, which was rot enough to
pay her board. Another herd of eight
cuws profited $457 in a 5 ear, with the
best cows yielding 322 pounds of butter
fat, the herd aveiage being 267 pounds
One dairyman milks and cares for 16
cows to get the same money that an
other milks 8 cows for.
"Wasteful feeding and inefficient
cows lose years cf hard labor and
thou&ands of acres of good grain. The
dairy expert of the university will
show just for the asking, how large
savings may be made each year, and
dairy work will not all be heartless
drudgery."
Railway Business For May.
For the month of 'May the net oper
ating revenue of the railways declined
five and five-tenths per cent, per mile
of line as compared with May 1911,
and that Maysl911 was four and eight
tenths per cent les than, for May 1910.
This is the salient fact 6f the monthly
summary of he Bureau of Railway
Economics, compiled from the re
ports of the railways to the Interstate
Commerce Commission and embracing
ninety per cent of the steam railway
mileage of the country.
The operating revenues were $226,
109,262, an increase ot $7 per mile ot
line.over May, 1911. The ODerating
expenses were 161,368,677, an increase
ot 24.29 per mile of line, while the net
operating revenue was 64,740,55, a de
crease of 17.23 per mile of line.
Taxes amounted for the month to 9,
897.301,or 45 per mil, an increase of
nine and two-tenthg per cent.
The decrease in'net operating reve
nue was most severe for the Eastern
group of railways, amounting to
eleven and nine-tenths per cent. For
the Southern group it increased four
tenths of one per cent, and for the
Western group less than one-tenth of
one per cent. The aggregate of the
net operating revenue for the eleven
months of the fiscal year, and also for
the five months of the calendar year,
when measured per mile of line, shows
a decrease in comparison with the cor
responding periods of the previous
year.
