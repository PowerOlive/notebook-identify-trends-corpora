I was treated by many physicians and tried
numerous remedies without permanent help

a Grand Success
EVERYBODY INTERESTED IN IT

decided to select several leading citi
zens from all parts of Kentucky to
inake some five minute talks
In the meantime a cell fcr the con-
vention had been distributed through
out the state for signers and in a
brief space of time it -went back to
Louisville with 257 names representing
t
ing a majority of the counties
I This call stated emphatically that it
was not made to any class of citizens
but to all men who are concerned in
the future of Kentucky It was for-
i mally issued about two weeks ago and
I met with a welcome the heartiness of
REIIAEZABLESPIBITOPPBOGEESS which left no doubt in the minds of
j those who have worked so
I ously for the success of the movement
It Is Not for the Benefit of a Class but
for tlie iVIasses Many Important Sub
jects Will Be Discussed by Those Most
Competent to Handle Them Promo
tion and Development Are to Be Con
sidered to the Exclusion of Less Profit
able Things
Kentuckys first state commercial
convention to be held in Louisville
May 11 and 12 is to be a success The
movement in that direction has pro
gressed far enough to assure those
engineering it of that fact
It is to be a success because the
lawyer the farmer the merchant the
manufacturer the lumber dealer the
mine owner the stockraiser the bank
er and the journalist will all unite in
one grand effort to push Kentucky and
her untold resources to the front It
is to be a success because business
talks are to take the place of political
speeches because promotion and de
velopment are to be discussed to the
exclusion of less profitable things
finally it is to be a success because the
time is ripe for a state commercial
convention to be a success
Less than two months ago several
pragressive business men members
of the Louisville Commercial clu
held a meeting in Louisville to form
ulate plans for a convention which
would have for its object the creation
of a sentiment favorable to industrial
development teaching the benefits of
such a course and to prepare literature
setting forth Kentuckys advantages
This little gathering was followed by
larger ones until the bit of enterprise
that was manifested in the first meet
ing burst into a spirit of progress that
was made to permeate the entire
state The convention soon assumed
tangible form An executive commit
tee with representatives from every
congressional district was named as
were committees on delegation press
and publicity finance transportation
hall entertainment and delegation
state at large Mr Clarence Dallam
a well known and popular young at
torney of Louisville who is a native of
Henderson but was for many years
identified with Paducah as a lawyer
was elected chairman and Mr J C
Van Pelt assistant secretary of the
Commercial club secretary
Thus industrys star of promotion
rose rapidly A meeting was held at
which seven of the 11 districts had
prominent representation and a pro
gram was arranged the following
subjects being selected as those that
are to be discussed during the con
vention
Kentuckys Advantages Geo
graphical Climate and Soil
Our Agricultural Opportunities and
Needs
Our Industrial Opportunities and
Needs
The Best System of State and Lo
cal Taxation
How May Capital Be Best Attract
ed to and Most Profitably Employed

Happy Selection of Dates
The selection of the dates for the
meeting of the state commercial con
vention in Louisvihe was a happy so
lution of the question as to the best
time that the industrial congress
should be held It falls in a week
which will offer to the visitors to the
Falls City a series of attractions un
surpassed in the same length of time
in any city in the country The May
Music Festival is on May 9 10 and 11
The Sons of Veterans hold their3 an
nual reunion on May 11 and 12 the
days of the Commercial convention
The 100000 cyclorama cf the Battle
of Gettysburg is also in Louis
ville and will be another attraction
And all week the races will be going
on In the running horse one of the
closest approaches to perfection
known has been developed It is
hoped that as the delegates to the
Commercial convention look on the
steeds dash under the wire they will
hope the stronger that other Ken
tucky products may reach that per
fection with proper handling
The State Commercial Convention
Will build up our cities large and
small
Will induce the restless and dis
satisfied of other states to settle here
Will improve and extend our
country reads and our rcilroad facili
ties
Will encourage every effort looking
to the improvement of our navigable
streams
Will bring together men who have
faith in the future of Kentucky and
who desire to manifest their faith by
their works
i Will enhance the value of our ag
ricultural lands by seeking the best
methods for diversifying our products
and the best means for reaching the
worlds markets
j Will aid our miners who are dig
ging for coal in our hillsides and
those seeking markets for such prod
ucts or rock asphalt the timber from
our forests and iron from our ore beds
1 Will encourage the coming of cap
ital not so much by offering bonuses
I or special privileges but assuring to
all men the full enjoyment of life lib
erty and property and the best facili
ties for exchange in all the markets
of the world
i State Commercial Convention Notes
The mayors and judges are to act as
i delegates ex officio
One editor from every newspaper in
the state has been invited as a dele
gate
I A special tobacco sale will be ar
ranged by the tobacco warehouses to
take place during the convention
Either a banquet or a reception fol
lowed by an elegant smoker will be
tendered the delegates after the con
vention has adjourned
Races of one fare for the round trip
from any part of Kentucky have been
secured over the railroads for dele
gates to the commercial convention
An invitation will be extended to all
the members of the legislature to all
congressmen to Senators Lindsay and
Deboe to the court of appeals and to
all the state officials to be present at
the convention
A competent stenographer has been
engaged to take down all the speeches
and proceedings of the convention so
they may be published in pamphlet
form and distributed over the state
This will give every county a look
into the conventions work
The time is ripe for a new cam
paign in behalf of the industrial agri
cultural and commercial prosperity of
Kentucky The country stands upon
the opening of a new industrial era
Millions of capital foreign and domes
tic will shortly be invested in Amer
ica
The executive committee has been
notified by Mr M A Scovell director
and chemist of the state college at
Lexington that he will prepare a pa
per on The Possibilities of Ken
tucky as a Dairy State This will be
another feature to add to the interest
ing program
Each mayor in the state and every
county judge has been requested to
appoint delegates to the convention
Cities of the first and second class will
be entitled to 100 delegates third
class 60 fourth class 10 fifth class
5 sixth class 2 The county judge
will appoint three delegates
Kentucky has great coal fields prac
tically untouched She has agricul
tural resources unsurpassed She has
an abundance of timber the value of
which can not be overestimated The
state then needs men and capital to
develop these natural stores of wealth
and the commercial convention offers
the beginning of the opportunity -

HOW TO FIND OUT
Fill a bottle or common glass with urine
and let it stand twenty four hours a sedi
ment or settling indicates an unhealthy con
dition of the Kidneys When urine stains
linen it is evidence of kidney trouble Too
frequent desire to urinate or pain in the
back is also convincing proof that the kid
neys and bladder are out of order

There is comfort in the knowledge so often
expressed that Dr Kilmers Swamp Root
the great kidney remedy fulfills every wish
in relieving pain iu the back kidneys liver

scalding pain in passing i or bad effects fol
lowing use of liqudr wine or beer and over
comes that unpleasant necessity of being
compelled to get up many times iluring the
night to urinate The mild and the extraor
dinary eflect of is soon realized
It stands the highest for its wonderful cures
of the most distressing ca es If you jied
