Simms, near Paris. The gathering was a representative one, comprising ministers, bankers, lawyersand business men, and there weredelegations from Lexington, Winchester, Shelbyville, Cynthiana, anda number of other Central Kentucky towns. The object of thegathering together of these leadingcitizens of the Bluegrass was to endeavor to impress upon them thesplendid work which is being donein Bourbon county by the Fish andGame Club in their efforts to enforce tthe recent laws along these linespassed by the State Legislature, andto further impress upon them thegreat good the county is derivingfrom it.During the early hours of themorning the weather was threatening, but about noon the sun brokethrough the rapidly disappearingclouds and shone brightly amongthe vari-colored hues of the foliageof the forest trees, which are neverso beautiful as in the early fall.The location was an ideal one. Thesplendid turnpike from Paris led tothe gates of ' the farm, throughwhich asphalt driveways lined withoverhanging trees, brought the visitors to the large woodland, with itsdeep carpet of bluegrass and sturdyoak and maple trees clad in theirearly autumn dress. Long beforethe first guest arrived preparationsfor the feast to be served were wellunder way. Deep trenches had beendug, and over these were placed themutton to be barbecued. Over othertrenches large caldrons sent forththe appetizing aroma of burgoo.Still other trenches held mammothpans in which were being fried toa crisp brown hundreds of bass,newlights, bream and other speciesof fish. At 1 o'clock, after the appetites of the guests had been whetted-by the smell of the cooking, the call-for dinner was announced, and fol-?lowing the giving of thanks by Rev.T. S. Smylie, pastor of the ParisPresbyterian church, the guests'formed in double file, and proceededto the large table, where the following menu awaited them:Burgooo, barbecued lamb, friedfish, old county ham, fried chicken, hard boiled eggs, beaten biscuit,sandwiches, pickles, cakes, doughnuts, coffee and cigars.After the inner man had been fully satisfied addresses were made byJudge James G. Denny, of Lexington, J. Quincy Ward, of Cynthiana, Sam Clay, of Paris, andMr. Noonan, of Winchester. JudgeDenny said that in his opinion therewas no place in the South where thespirit of comradeship and truesportsmanship were more fully developed than in Bourbon county. Hepaid a tribute to E. F. Simms, ownerof Xalapa Farm, whom he said wasone of America's foremost sportsmen, and also to the memory of thelate Thomas Henry Clay, Jr., whomhe termed the prince of allsports. Judge Denny praisedthe efficient service given thepeople of the State bygiven the people of the State by J.Quincy Ward, former head of theState Fish and Game Commission.Bourbon county, he said, is leadingin the great work mapped out bythe Fish and Game Commission inendeavoring to conserve the fish andgame of the State. He pledged thehearty co-operation of Fayettecounty.Mr. Ward said ne consideredBourbon county to be one of, if notthe best county in the State. Heblushed for shame, he said, to haveit said that there had been thirtyeight conviction in the county recently for violations of the fish andgame laws. Game and fish in Kentucky, he said, in the matter of foodalone, amounted to a sum of at Jeast$3,000,000 annually. He advocatedan increased hunting license, to be ajoint fishing and hunting one, withchildren and women free. He concluded by urging the farmers and tobacco growers to do all in theirpower to advance the final successof the proposed Co-operative Burley Tobacco Marketing Association,which meant so much to the farmersand business men. Mr. Noonan andSam Clay followed with interestingspeeches. Among the visitors present were the following:From Clark county, John D. Foote,T. H. Hampton, R. A. J. Huls, N.E. Ellis, C. D. Huls, Gus G.

Mitchell, Former ParisianCharged With a StatutoryOffenseCONFINED IN REFORMATORYCharged with a serious offense,an alleged criminal assault on aneleven-year-old Lexington girl, Mildred Sorrell, Harry L. Mitchell, ofthat city, a former resident of Paris,is a prisoner in the Frankfort Reformatory, where he was takenTuesday night, for safe-keeping, onan order from Circuit Judge Stoll.Mitchell stoutly maintains his innocence, and denies even knowing thegirl.The girl first told her parentsthat she had been assaulted in Duncan pak by a colored man, and latermade a confession, in which shestated that her first accusation wasuntrue, and that she had been enticed into an automobile driven byHarry L. Mitchell, of 611 ElsmerePark, and that he was the one whohad assaulted her, threatening herwith death if she told of the occurrence. The alleged assault, she saidwas committed in Mitchell's automobile while driving on the Winchester pike, near Lexington, Sunday night.Mitchell was arrested by Lexington police and detectives at hishome Tuesday night, following thegirl's confession, and was taken inan automobile immediately afterward to the Frankfort Reformatoryby order of Circuit Judge Stoll.Warrants for his arrest had beensworn out by the girl's father,Henry Sorrell, of Lexington. Twoindictments were returned againsthim by a special grand jury Mondayafternoon, and were served beforethe prisoner was taken to Frankfort.At the Reformatory, Mitchell stoutlydenied the assault and stated that hedid not even know the child, thathe had never taken any young girlin his machine, and that the onlytime he was ever in Duncan Parkwas when he had taken his, adoptedson, Jack Mitchell, for a ride.Mitchell was visited in the Reformatory by his son, Wm. Mitchell,I accompanied by his attorneys, Robt.jpramum, oi .uexingion, ana xiouertC. Talbott, of Paris, who made arrangements for defending theirclient. William Mitchell stated thathe knew -beyond the shadow of adoubt that his father was innocentof the charge.It is believed Mitchell will bearraigned some time next week andthe two indictments returned by thegrand jury Monday in the name ofJohn Doe read to him.No further statement concerningthe facts of the case was made bythe authorities. Police, it is known,are continuing their work on thecase and are obtaining witnesses.Just what the proof to be offeredby the Commonwealth will be is forthe most part a secret, while members of the law firm of Franklin,Talbott & Chapman, attorneys forMitchell, also have declined to makeany statement bearing on the case.Mitchell, however, will be kept inthe Reformatory until his trial ashe is not eligible for bail.The news of Mr. Mitchell's arrstcame as a shock to the people ofParis, many of whom have been hiswarm personal friends. Many claimthat the serious accident in whichhe was a victim on the L. & N. railroad several years ago, had left himin such a fHion, physically andmentally, as not to be responsiblefor his acts. At the trial of thecase in the Bourbon Circuit Court,many reputable physicians gave testimony to his impaired mental andphysical condition.Mr. Mitchell was formerly in theemploy of the L. & N. railroad as afreight conductor until he was incapacitated by an accident. Following the accident he brought suitagainst the L. & N. and was awarded a verdict for $30,000, which wasupheld by a decision of the Court ofAppeals. Mr. Mitchell opened a realestate office in Paris with his son,William Mitchell, as partner, anddid a successful business. Some agohe disposed of his Paris home andmoved with his family to Lexington,retaining his Paris business incharge of his son, making daily tripsto and from Lexington.CHRISTMAS PHONOGRAPH CLUB,COME IN AND JOIN TO-DAY.Limited to 25 members only seeadvertisement in this issue and jointo-day.E.

From this small beginning in a little log church house atCane Ridge, the Christian churchhas grown to its present proportions. The congregation at CaneRidge, which we may truly call"the Mother Church," has disbanded and no regular services are heldthere now. But the building is stillintact, and the grounds where thebody of Barton W.
