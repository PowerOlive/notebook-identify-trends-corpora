WHAT
THE MOTORIST
FOR HIS FUN.
PAYS
For every mile of highway in the
United States, that is equal to the
demands of automobile traffic, each
motor vehicle pays $75 to taxes!
That is the estimate of R. E. Ful
ton, a truck manufacturer, who
reaches these figures this way:
In 1918, motorists paid to the
various States a total of $150,000,
000 in all kinds of taxes and tees,
besides increasing the Federal
treasury by $33,000,000. Since
there ar2 2,500,000 miles of high
way, improved and unimproved, in
the county figure the rest out for
yourself.
