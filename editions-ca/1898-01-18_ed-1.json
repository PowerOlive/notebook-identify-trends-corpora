SELLING BYSINAI7
HOW CATTLE ARE DEALT IN AT THE
- CHICAGO STOCKYARDS
Bitting In Their Saddles With tlie tot
i Between Them Seller and Buyer Con
clude a Transaction by Raising Their
Whips Over Their Beads
Tho Chicago stockyards are unique
among the great marts of the world In
no other place say those who are most
familiar with its daily routine is so
large an aggregate of business transact
ed in the language of gestures and with
out the scratch of a pen as in the
noisy pens of the stockyards A whip
and sold
is held high in air across a sea of
which he
pauses to note the names of those with
whom he deals and the amount nature
the Stock Exchange places equal reli
ance upon the quickly penciled memo
randa made at the moment when the
details of each transaction were upon
the lips of those concerned in its fulfill
ment but the buyer and seller of tho
yards carry whips not pencils and
their deals are recorded in memory in
stead of written upon trading cards As
well try to picture the old knigbts mak
ing laborious written memoranda of
their challenges as to think of the rough
and ready traders of the cattle yards
pausing in their saddles to jot down
upon paper their purchases and sales
Such a procedure would bid defiance to
the -very nature of things and do vio
lence to the magnificent unconvention
ally of every environment
Is there never any trouble in this
kind of dealing a leading commission
man was asked
their bargains made by whip and hand
I can answer never was the traders
answer as he brought his trim black
horse to a halt in the cattle alley and
leaned forward in his saddle There
isnt another place in America or the
whole world for that matter where so
much business is done on the basis of
personal integrity without a written
wnrrl fr olinw frvr flifi frrfmsrirHrm3 ns
hi- - r
right here he continued and the
method beats all the bonds on earth
The days business in these pens will
run about 1500000 And how is it
done Little talk a considerable wav
ing of whips and hands and no exchange
of written documents between buyers
and sellers
Here is a bunch of cattle that will
figure up about Si 0000 Over there in
A BACHELORS QUARTERS
tothinff Homelike About Them Accord
ing to tho Married Mans Story
They hadnt met since the old college
days ten years before and of course the
benedict insisted that the bachelor
should come home to dinner with him
Married the year after I left col
lege he said and I have the nicest
little home and the finest lot of young
sters that you ever saw I want you to
come out and see how nicely Im fixed
I tell you a man doesnt know what
life is until hes married
No
Well I should say not
And so it happened that the bachelor
went with the benedict and met the
latter s wife and played with his chil
dren and made himself generally useful
inS ho the is answered
f signal by and popular mfil they were all seated
cT C T 8t - at the dinner table
a bunch of cattle worth thousands of
Ifc ws oyer tho coffee and cigarS affc
dollars is sold er the benedicts wife had left the table
1XttaB i iemmg spienuiuiy tbat thfl benedict finally suggested
and
turesque even spectacular in these
wordless transactions They ignore the
artificialities of the complex system up
on which modern business relationships
are almost universally maintained
Trade in the cattle pens gets boldly
back to primitive simplicity It is done
on honor not on paper And the undis
puted transfer of millions of dollars
worth of the property here dealt in
proves that a bargain sealed with the
wave of the whip and an assenting ges
ture of tho hand is quite as safe and sa
cred as if the whole transaction were
recorded in black and white
Pretty comfortably fixed aint I old
mas Children why dont you go into
the other room
Very nicely indeed answered the
bachelor replying to the first question
and ignoriug the second
Oh theres nothing like home life
went on the benedict Willie stop
trying to climb on Mr Browns knee
He wants to smoke Do you know old
man I laugh when I think of my fool
ish idea that I knew in those old days
what happiness wTas Why a man
doesnt begin to live until Maggie

to laugh when I think of it Our idea of
contentment in those days was to get a

Would you mind moving your coffee
cup a little farther back on the table
old man Tommies trying to reach it
and my wife would raise my scalp if I
should let him break one of her very
best cups Thats it Thank you As I
was saying we didnt know what ease
and contentment was in those days No
single man does A man has to have a
big armchair and his slippers all ready
for him and everything sort of restful
and quiet before Now dont cry Ma
bel If you didnt want to get hurt
why did you grab the end of my cigar
Tommie take her in to her mother
There Willie I told you youd stick
that nutpick into your hand if you
didnt look out Run into the other
room and ask your mother to put a
bandage on it Lets see where was I
old man Oh yes I remember now I
was about to say tnat there s nothing
If you mean do the men go back on homelike about a bachelors quarters
No interrupted the bachelor with
considerable emphasis there isnt
The benedict couldnt quite see the
reason for such an emphatic assertion
but he wisely changed the subject just
the same Chicago Post
Feeding a Baby Elephant
In St Nicholas F Fitz Roy Dixon
tells of a baby elephant that was cap-
tured by friends of his in Ceylon after
the death of its mother Mr Dixon says
When Sidney was first brought over
virtually in order that she might be
fed the question naturally arose as to
how she would take her nourishment
Of course the proper way for an adult
elephant to take in water is by means
of the trunk which is furnished with
two tubes running its whole length
the other alley is a buyer who this But when a bowl of milk was placed
morning offered me a price of 5 10 for
them I thought that I could do better
but the market has been a little off and
I have decided to let the bunch go at
his offer Up to the present moment
we hav exchanged about a dozen words
this subject Now he is willing to
q jirice which he named in the
miming Ill show you how a 10000
bunch of fat steers is sold without
word of mouth or a scratch of writing
at the time the bargain is really made
before the baby elephant she did not
know what to do with it She dipped
the tip of her trunk into it and the
lookers on thought that there would be
no difficulty about her drinking at all
since she recognized the scent of the
nourishment she had been accustomed
to But she was quite at a loss and ft
up a roar which seemed quite natural
under the circumstances Then some
one suggested pouring it down her
throat from a bottle and this was ac-
The commission man then straighten- j cordingly tried and after one or two in
effectual attempts she understood
She was half starved when this was
done for she had had nothing to eat
since the death of her mother and her
delight at being fed was most amusing
The only trouble was that it was diffi
cult to satisfy her and it was feared
that the change of diet would disagree
with her but fortunately it had no ill
effect
perfectly We both know how many hy an called mandarin and
cattle there are in the bunch and the
price at which they have been sold
Had we been within speaking distance
of each other the transaction would
probably have been a verbal one just
for the sake of sociability but not be
cause it would have mae the bargain
ibetter understood or any more binding

ed up in the saddle and waited for the
distant buyer to look in his direction
A moment later this representative of
a big packing house wheeled his horse
about and faced in the direction of the
seller Instantly the commission man
lifted high his rawhide riding whip
and held it aloft His attitude was as
striking as that of a cavalry colonel up
lifting his saber to concentrate the at
tention of his regiment before making
a desperate pharge The pose however
was full of natural grace and freedom
and showed that the man was more at
ease in the saddle than he could have
been out of it

Oranges
The very sweetest orange and richest
is the black or rusty coated fruit Pick
out the dingiest oranges in the box and
you will get the best Another way to
choose oranges is by weight The
alert eye of the buyer caught sight of ie ar3 the best because they have the
the upraised whin The next instant he wunnesi SKin ana more weigni oi juice
raised his hand a little above his head
held it motionless a moment and then
dropped it with a forward movement
Quickly the seller repeated the motion
of assent with his whip and then turn
ing to his caller said
Thats all there is to it To a stran
ger this kind of a performance looks
like a long rango sign talk between deaf
mutes -but wo understand each other
Thick skinned oranges are apt to be dry
They either weigh less because of hav
ing so much skin or because of the pov
erty of the juice in these particular
specimens A slight freezing on the
tree causes this condition in otherwise
fine fruit Tho kid glove oranges are
the two varieties of small fruit grown
in Florida from stocks respectively
brought from China and from Tangier
me Tuey may be eaten witnout soiling
a kid glove because the skin is loose
and the little gores or pockets of
juice come apart very cleanly and with
out breaking All the above applies to
Florida oranges The Jamaica and Ha
vana oranges are much paler yellow
and their juice is usually of more acid
quality than the home grown oranges

THE MOUNTAIN MAID
She Had 9 Natural Anxiety Which Sh9
Made Manifest
As my horse puffing like a porpoise
drew me and my buckboard up the last
sharp acolivity of tho mountain road
that led Dut into the pass between the
summits rising on either hand he would
have exercised his privilege and stopped
a moment to blow but 100 yards ahead
of us I saw a bright bit of calico gleam
ing in the morning sun and driving on
I came up to a buxom mountain maid
sitting on a stump at a point where a
footpath leading up from the valley
met the main road
Good mornin she said before I
had a chance to stop and there seemed
to be an anxious tone in the voice
Good morning I responded and S
was on the point of asking her how far
it was to the next place a favorite man
ner of starting a conversation on moun
tain roads when she broke in
Air you a preacher she asked
No I answered with a smile for I
had never been asked that question be
fore
Nor a squire
No
Well Jim Martins comin along
this away purty soon now an I wuz
jis axin sos thar wouldnt be no mis
takes
I dont quite understand your ex
planation I said completely in the
dark as to what she was trying to get at
I reckon not but I aint tak in no
chances an I thought Id better stop
you while I had the chance
Thank you Im sure but if you
will tell me whats up I may be able to
know what you are talking about
She laughed good naturedly
Well you see its this a way she
said Jim hes been a courtin an
a sparkin round me fer about two yer
now an last night he popped an says ez
how ef Id be here this mornin ez he
come along wed go down to Logville

squire er the preacher an I didnt want
you to git away Ef you meet Jim any

ABOUT THE WEATHER
Mr Wingleby Explains to Georgia About
the Seasons
You see Georgie said Mr Win
gleby whose youthful son had asked
him how we came to have different
kinds of weather the weather is put
up in tin cans a days weather to a
can and usually they put up about a
years supply ahead enough to last
through a spring summer autumn and
winter In filling the cans they sort it
all out as well as possible Sometimes
when they get a can full there mayjfae a
little left over and whatever remains
in this way they throw into one lot
When theyve got pretty nearly all ihe
cans full and the regular stock
er has run out they fill up from that
lot of odds and ends The cans so filled
contain what is called variable weather
because its mixed but most of the
weather they get pretty well sorted out
according to the season
When theyve got all the cans filled
they stack em up where theyll be
handy to get at and theres a man that
does nothing but open them Every day
he cuts a can and pours out the weather
for that day and of course a great deal
depends upon him Sometimes this man
gets careless and pulls down a lot of the
wrong cans getting them say from the
July shelf in the month of April and
likely as not getting dwn a weeks
supply at once so as to have them handy
oh the opening table Of course he dis
covers his mistake the first can he opens
but he is too lazy to put the rest back
and so he keeps on then he has
opened them all and thats how it
comes about as it sometimes does that
we get a hot spell at a season when we
ought to have nothing but cool weather
But of course those April cans are
not lost They must be around some
where and we get em later Maybe
the man will sprinkle them along witl
the hope that we wont notice them
much but as likely as not he opens
them one after another together maybe
after some terribly hot spell in July or
August when they are sure to be a
blessed relief and if he does this we are
pretty apt to forgive him his mistake in
