already enlisted for tnePhilippine service will be sent at onceand the new regiments will be forwarded as fast as they are organizedand needed While there has beensome suggestion that the new regiments will be used as a reserve forceit may be stated positively that theseregiments as well as more if they canbe used will be sent to reinforce GenOtisSecretary Root sent a copy of the order of Thursday to the various departments of the army and they at oncebegan preparations for supplying thenew organizationsWithin half an hour the ordnancebureau had sent orders to the different arsenals directing that completeoutfits of arms and ordnance suppliesfor each regiment be sent to rendezvous where they are to be organizedThe quartermasters department gaveorders for supplying tents clothing

attention of the secretary and the men are being chosenfrom among the volunteers who werecalled out in the Spanish war Theofficers will be distributed as equitablyas possible among the different

1exM Hatfchenie to Colonise Them andErect Negro StateChicago Aug 10 At the meetingof the colored mens convention FridayBishop L H Holsey of Texas proposed to the members an entirely newcheme for the solution of the raceproblem His idea is to have the Negroes build up a separate governmentof their own but instead of deportingthem to Africa as advocated by BishopTurner of Georgia he would have thismecca of the colored man located within the United StatesBishop Holsey explains his proposition as followsThere is but one way to solve thisproblem and that is separation andsegregation That is the Negro racemust occupy a state or states and holdterritory to themselves To makethis movement effective 1500000 voters should sign a petition to congressto set apart a sufficient amount of thepublic domain with proper legislativerestrictions by which a state or statesmay be erected which will be distinctly Negro states having all the rightspowers privileges functions and political facilities given other states inthe unionIf this can be accomplished the blackman would derive all the benefits andadvantages for development that makea people intelligent thoughtful andnobleThe removal of the Negro to such astate or states would settle the greatproblem as far as the Negro is concerned and would relieve the south ofmany a side issue in the social and political worldWhen asked what portion of theUnited States had been selected bythe advocates of the scheme BishorHolsey replied Oklahoma and NewMexico have been mention but wehave not got so far with the projectthat we feel in a position to select anyparticular territoryON CONDITIONM Guerin Will Surrender on Ilia Own Conditions and Refuses to Accept ThoseProposed by Gen lacqueyParis Aug 19 Guerin decidedFriday night to

ReportsWashington Aug 19 The reportof the commission appointed by thepresident in 1S97 from the marine hospital service staff to investigate thenature of yellow fever was Fridaymade public by Surgeon General Wyman The commission was composedof Surgeon Eugene Wasdin and PastAssistant Surgeon Geddings both yellow fever expertsThe conclusions of the commissionare summarized as followsFirst That the micro organism discovered by Prof Guiseppe Sanarelli ofthe university of Bologna Italy andby him named Bacillus icteroides isthe cause of yellow feverSecond That yellow fever is naturally infectious to certain animals thedegree varying with the species thatin some rodents local infection is veryquickly followed by blood infectionand that while in dogs and rabbitsthere is no evidence of this subsequentinvasion of the blood monkeys reactto the infection the same as manThird That infection takes place byway of the respiratory tract the primary colonization in this tract fivinorise to the earlier manifestations oithe diseaseFourth That in many cases oi thecisease probably a majority the primary infection or colonization in tholungs is followed by a secondary infection or a secondary colonization ofthis organism in the blood of the patient This secondary infection maybe complicated by the cinstantaneouspassage of other organisms into theblood or this complication may ariseduring the last hours of lifeFifth That there is no evidence tosupport the theory advanced by ProfSanarelli that this disease is primarilya septicaemia inasmuch as cases dooccur in which the bacillus icteroidescan not be found in the blood or organs in which it might be depositedtherefromSixth That there exists no casualrelationship between the bacillus Xof Sternberg and this highly infectiousdisease and that the bacillus X iflfrequently found in the intestinal contents or normal animals and of manas well as in the urine and th bronchial sectionSeventh That so far as your commission is aware the bacillus icteroideshas never been found in any body etherthan one infected with yellow feverand that whatever may be the culturalsimilarities between this and othermicro organisms it is characterized bya specificity which is distinctiveEighth That the bacillus icteroidesis very susceptible to the influences injurious to bacterial life and that itsready control by the processes of disinfection chemical and mechanical isassuredNinth That the bacillus icteroidesproduces in vitro as well as in vata atoxin of the most marked potency andthat from our present knowledgethere exists a reasonable possibilityfor the ultimate production of an antiserum more potent than that of ProfSanarelliPATROLLING THE COASTThe Santo Domingo Government Apprehensive of the

majority of theforeign newspapers have been bribedby the Jewish syndicate Gen Mercierconsiders anything he might say explaining his posi ion which is that ofa majority of the French people wouldle useless The best reniv to Drevfusrari statements abroad will be the condemnation of DreyfusThis condemnation is only a matterof ten days or a fortnight for condemned Dreyfus certainly will beForeigners will then see that their journals have deceived them for they willrecognize that the mass of the Frenchnation who will Receive the news ofthe conviction of Dreyfus as joyfultidings is

suffering severely from insomnia and Sunday wasfeverish and excited The wound itself has not made the progress the doctors hoped for although there hadbeen no relapse In view of this general condition his medical advisers oppose his going to court Mondayas he had desired They predictthat the exertion would so-overtax his strength as to compel himto take to his bed which he wouidprobably not leave

thatit was well in the morning and the sunshone brightly All traces of cloud werefeone though soft billows of mist rolled overthe olive gardens and vineyards of Chiantigrape that stretched towards MontevarchiHeavens man How you slept I wasright when I hinted you had a good conscience1 scrambled up with a hasty Good-morningand a few minutes afterwards having finished the remains of the wine in theskin we started off in the direction of Bucine My companion had politely never inquired my name and I had been equally reticent He placed on his head a silken foolscap and the bells on it jingled incessantlyas he walked along with a jaunty air at apace that was remarkable for a man of hisage He seemed to have lost the melancholy that possessed him during the nightand conversed in so cheerful and entertaining a manner that in spite of myself I wasinterested and withdrawn from my unhappy thoughts He kept up his mood to Bucinc where notwithstanding our strangeappearance we attracted to my relief lessattention than 1 imagined we should drawWith appetites sharpened by our walkwe did full justice to the meal 1 ordered atthe only hotel in ihe place Here I playedhost as a ret urn for my entertainment andin conversation my acquaintance said that hewas bound for Florence 1 told him thatalso was my point and invited him to bearme company on the road to which he willingly agreed I made an attempt here tchire a horse but not even a donkey wasprocurable all available carriage havingbeen seized upon for the army So oncemore descending the hill on which Bucineis situated we forded the river and continued our journeyAt the albcrgo we heard that a body oftroops were foraging along the banks of theArno and resolved to make a detour andTossing Monte Luco to keep on the sides ofthe Cliiaiili hills if necessary avoiding Montevarchi altogether My companion maintained his high spirits until we reached thfltop of the spur of Monte Luco known to thepeasantry as the Virgins Cradle

at Bucine intended tospend in trying to hire an animal of somekin1 to ruleWe stopped at the Bell inn near the gateand after a deal of bargaining which consumed a good hour the landlord agreed tohire me his mule for two crowns The rascal wanted ten at first Just as the matterwas settled a dozen or so of troopers rodein and spying the mule in the twinkling ofan eye claimed it for carriage purposesIt was in vain that the landlord protestedthat it was his last beast that it had beenhired to the noble cavuliere meaning meand man other things betide The soldierswere deat to his entreaties and although 1had more than a mind to draw on the villains I had the good sense to restrain myself for the odds were too many againstrue I therefore hid my chagrin under asmile and the mule was led away amidstthe lamentations of mine host who was further put out of pocket by a gallon or so ofwine which the troopers consumed doubtless in honor of the prize they had takenneglecting in the true fashion of the compagnes grandea to pay for it It was a titlesson to the landlord for had he not inhis cupidity haggled tor an hour over thehire of the animal he might have beenricher by two crowns and still owned hismule Thus it is that avarice finds its ownpunishmentOn going ofi the leader of the troop a manwhom I knew by sight and by reputationas s swashbuckler if ever there was onemade me a mock salute saying in allusionto my quietness in surrendering my claimto the mule Adieu Messer Feather Capmay your courage grow as long as yoursword This taunt 1 swallowed ruefullyand immediately set about my departureMy companion who was not mixed up inthe altercation joined me silently and wefollowed in the direction taken by the troopera pursued by the maledictions of lhe innkeeper who vented his spleen on us as theindirect cause of his misfotuneThe foragers who owing to the warmthcf the weather had removed their breastplates which were slung to their raddlesmere going at a walking pace and it wasamusing to see how the mere sight of theirpresence cleared the streets Noting however that they did not appear to he bent onpersonal injury we did not think it necessary to go out of our course or delay ourdeparture until they left the town and aswe walked fast and they went slowly bythe time they had reached the main squarewe were not more than a dozen yards behindthemAt this moment we noticed the figure of awoman apparently blind for she wasguided by a little dog attached to a stringThe poor creature was crossing the pavesent almost in front of the leader of thetroop and as she was right in the pathof the troopers we attempted to warn herly shouting and she stopped irresolutelyhardly knowing which way to turn Thetmnn lilfr wit limit mliiio anv effort tnravoid her rode on in a pitiless manner andshe was flung sense ss to the ground Inthis her hood fell back uncovering her faceand my companion suddenly uttering a lou Icry ran forward a J seizing her in hisarms began to address her with every termof endearment in the manner of a father tohis childThe troopers halted discipline it will beobserved was not great and one of themwith rough sympathy called to my friendto bear the girl for so she looked to thefountain at the same time that their commander gave a loud order to go on and toleave off looking at a fool and a beggar Ihad however made up my mind that therewas a little work for me and drawing mvsword stepped up to the swashbucklersbridle and asked for a five minutes interview there and thenHe burst into a loud laugh Corpo diPucco Here is Messer Feather Cap with hiscourage grown Here two of you bind himto the muleBut the men with him were in no moodto obey and one of them openly saidIt is alwa3s thus with the ancient BricoDo you intend to give me the pleasure 1seek I asked or has the ancient Bricotaken off his heart with his corseletFor a moment it looked as if he wereabout to ride at me but my sword wasready and 1 Avas standing too close to himfor any such treachery to be carried offFlinging the reins therefore to the neck ofhis horse he dismounted slowly and drewhis sword A number of the townsfolkattracted by the scene so far forgot theirtear of the foragers as to collect around usand in a few moments a ring was formedone portion of which was occupied by thetroopersBrico took his stand so as to place thesun in my eyes manif acss forwe should have n yetf made no objection an iasping nicloak let it fall to the g behind meA roue he called out and the next mosneat we engaged in the lower circle my opponent for all his French cry adopting theItalian method and using a dagger to parryFor a few seconds we tried to feel eachother and I was delighted with the balanceof my sword It did not take me half a minute to see that he was a child in my handsand I began to rapidly consider whether itwould lie worth the candle to kill him ornot Brico who had commenced the assault with a stamp of his foot and a succession of rapid thrusts in the lower linesbecame aware of his weakness as soon as Idid and began to back slowly I twicepricked him over the heart and his handlegin to shake so that he could hardly holdhis weaponMake way there 1 called out mockingly the ancient would like to run a littleMaddened by this taunt he pulled himself together and lunged recklessly at me intierce it was an easy parry and with astrong beat 1 disarmed him He did notwait but with the rapidity of a hare turnedand fled not so fast however but that 1 wasable to accelerate his departure with astroke from the flat of my swordAdieu ancient Brico 1 called out afterhim as lie ran on followed by a howl of derision from the crowd in which his ownmen joinedIt was lucky that 1 adopted the course ofdisarming him for had the affair endedotherwise I doubt not that the men-at-armswould have felt called ujon to avengetheir leader poltroon as he vvs As ithappened they enjoyed his discomfiture andan old trooper called out to meWell fought signore you should joinus there is room for your sword under thebanner of Tremouille What no I nrasorry but go in peace for you bare rid us ofa curtSaying this he rode off one of their number leading the ancients horse by the bridle1 turned now to look for mv companionHe was nowhere to be seen and on inquirI found that he had lifted the girl up amisupporting her on his arm the two followedby the dog had turned down by thechurch and were not in view It would nodoubt hive been easy to follow and as easyto trace them but I reasoned that the manmust have purposely done this to avoid meand after all it was no business of mine 1therefore rejturucd my sword to its sheathand walked onCHAPTER VDENTRANGUES SCORES a POINTBefore 1 had gone fifty paces however Ibecame aware that there was some law leftiu Montevarchi for a warning cry made melook over my shoulder and I saw a party ofthe city guards who had discreetly kept outof the way when Brico and I crossed swordshurrying towards me The same glanceshowed ni that the ancient was already intheir hands and was being dragged alongwith but little regard to his comfort and1 felt sure that now as the troop was gonethe citizens would wreak their vengeance onthis hen roost robber and he would belucky if he escaped with life As for methe catchpolls being out they no doubt reasoned that they might as well net me Tostop and resist would only result in my being ultimately overpowered and perhapsimprisoned to yield without a blow meantvery much the same thing and in the shakeof a drakes tail I resolved to run and totrust for escape to my turn for speed So 1set off at my roundest pace followed by theposse and the rabble who but a momentbefore were cheering meMore than once 1 felt inclined to turn andend the matter for myself but the fact thatthis might mean laying aside all chance ofsettling DEntrangues urged me to my bestefforts Some fool made an attempt to stopme and I was compelled to slash him acrossthe face with my sword as a warning not tointerfere with matters with which he hadno concern 1 hardly knew where I wasgoing but dashed down a little by streetand v is after a hundred yards brought toa halt by a dead 1 could barely reachthe top of it with my bare hands butluckily this was enough to all me to drawmyself up and drop over to the other sidejust as the police reached within ten feetoi me I did not stop to take note of theiraction but was off as soon as my feettouched the ground and found to myjoy that 1 was close to one of the unrepaired breaches in the city wall made sixmonths ago by Tremouilles cannon1 hrough this 1 rushed and scrambling downa slope of broken stone and mortal- found1 would be compelled to climb down rerynearly a hundred feet of what looked like theface of a rock before I could reach levelground There was not even a goat trackMy agility was however spurred on by hearing shouts behind me and preferring to riskdeath in attempting the descent ratherthan fail into the hands of messer the podesta i chanced the venture and partly byholding on to the tough broom roots partlyslipping and aided by Providence and OurLady i i San Spirito to whom I hurriedlycast up a prayer 1 managed to reach thebottom and fell exhausted and breathlessinto a cistns hedge1 was t no beaten to go another yard andhad my pursuers only followed up musthave become an easy prey As it was 1 heardthem reach the breach where they came toa stop ail shouting and babbling at thesame lime One or two bolder than theothers a tempted to descend the ledge ofrock d own which I escaped but its steepness diimped their courage They howeversuceeded in loosening some of the debrisso that it fell over the cliff and a few of thest ies dropped very close to me but bygood hap 1 escaped or else this never wouldhave been written One great block indeedjust passed over my head and I vowed analtar piece to Our Lady of San Spiritowho alone could have diverted that whichwas coining straight to my destruction and1 may add 1 duly kept my word After atime the voices above began to grow fainteram to my delight I found that the citizensthinking it impossible I should have escapedlike a lizard amongst the rocks were harking back and ranging to the right and leftI waited until all sound died away and cautiously peeped out The coast was clear Ihad recovered my wind and without morewaste of time I rose and pressed on in thedirection of the hills determined to chanceno further adventures near the towns Indeed I had crowded more incident into thepast few hours than into the previous five-and-thirtyyears of my life and my sole object at present was to reach Florencewithout further let or hindranceKeeping the vineyards between me andthe town I avoided all observation andat a small wayside inn tilled a wallet which1 purchased with food and a bottle of therough country wine so that there might beno necessity for my visiting a human habitation during the remainder of my journeyWith the wallet swung over my shoulder anhour or so later I was ascending the slopesof Mount St Michele cursing the fallen pineneedles which made my foothold so slipperythat I slid rather than walkedIt was late in the evening before I haltedand ate my dinner under an overhangingrock sheltered from the north wind by aclump of pines When I finished 1 rolledmyself up in my cloak and fatigue together with a good conscience combined tosend me to a sleep as sound as it was refreshing 1 was up before the sun and continued my way determined to reach Florence by evening I took no particular notice of the view where I could see to myright the Prato Magno and to my left allthe valleys of the Orevc but kept my eyesbefore me intent on my thoughtsAt length when passing Impruneta wherethe Black Virgin is Florence came in sightThere was a slight haze which prevented mefrom seeing as clearly as I could wish but1 plainly made out the houses on the banksof the Arno Arnolfos tower the palaceof the Signory the cathedral the Bargelloand the unfinished Pitti palace whilst beyond rose the convent topped hill ofSenario where the Servites have their monasteryAs I looked there was little of admirationin my heart although the scene was fairenough but I could give no mind to anything beyond the fact that I was at lastwithin measurable distance of DEntranguesand that in a few hours my hand was liketo be at his throatWith these thoughts there somehow mingled up the face of madame and the sceneot our last meeting 1 put this aside however with a strong hand and determinedto think no more of her although no suchrecollection could be anything but pleasantand sweet Until 1 met her 1 had managedwell enough without womankind and forthe future 1 would leave bright eyes aloneVet I knew 1 was the better man for holdingthe privilege of her friendship Howevershe had passed out of my life and acrossthe seas I would have other things to thinkoi than the memory of my platonic friendship with Doris DLntrangiisit wih close upon sunset when I enteredthe San Picro gate and found myself inFlorence and in a difficulty at the sameI time in consequence of my wearing a swordI luckily however remembered that LaPalisse the French leader was then in thecity and explaining that I was from thearmy at Arezzo with a message to him inquired particularly his abode which I wastold was in the palace of the exiled Medici iuthe Via Larga It so happened that LaPalisse was in constant communication withTremouille and this and my confident bearing imposed upon the guards 1 supplemented my argument with a couple ofcrowns and they let me pass without further parley It will thus be seen that whatever the regulations may have been theywere ea iilv broken Indeed I found later onL ithat they were even at that time a deadletter and that the zeal of the guards wasmerely inspired by the prospect of makingsomething out of me which they did on thisoccasion 1 knew Florence very well havingbeen there under circumstances very different to the present but as I hurried alongthe crowded streets 1 began to feel 1 wassomewhat uncertain as to whither the roadsled 1 judged it prudent however not tomake inquiries but kept my eyes on thesharp lookout for a hostel suitable to mypurse which was diminishing at a fearfulrate 1 stopped for awhile at a street stallto satisfy my hunger with a cake of wheatand a glass of milk a wholesome but unpalatable beverage and entered intoonvcrstation with the stall keeper It came outthat I was in a difficulty about a lodgingand the man promptly told me where onecould be procured and added to his kindness seeing I was apparently a stranger tothe place by directing his son a small barelegged urchin to guide me to the bousewhich he said was an old palace of theAlbizzi that had passed into the hands ofthe banker Nobili and was rented out in tenementsHeaven only knows through what bylanes and alleys the imp led me chatteringlike an ape the whilst but at last we reachedthe house which lay in the street di PucciAn arrangement was soon entered into withthe person in charge and i paid in advancefor two weeks the small rent asked for theroom I took I selected the room becausethere was in it some furniture such as abed a table and a couple of chairs which1 was informed with some emphasis hadbeen seized from the last tenant in default ofrent I sent the boy away rejoicing andwas surprised to find the housekeeper didnot depait as well but this worthy soonmade it clear to me that a further paymentwas requisite on account of the furniture Iwas too tired to haggle so paid him thethree broad pieces he wanted and bid himget me some candles lie returned aftera little delay with what 1 needed and 1 maysay at once that under a rough exterior 1found this man with all his faults was capable on occasions of displaying true kindliness of heart1 would like to pay him this tribute forsubsequently as will be seen we had agrave difference of opinion which ended indisaster for him At the time this happened1 could not but condemn him strongly forin order to further a plot in which he wasengaged he tried to induce me to crime andwhen by a happy chance I was able to frustrate his design joined in an attempt to murder me 1 fully believe however now tiiitI look back on affairs coolly that in commonwith others of his age he thought it nowrong to
