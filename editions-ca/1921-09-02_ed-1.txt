Palmer, to developed what his father had discovered. It was B. J. Palmer who foundedthe P. S. C. It was a small beginning and few people iri Davenpoitrealized that it was destined to beone of the biggest institutions inthe world. In fact it was not formany years that. Davenport peoplerealized that there was such an institution, this being the case evenafter people from all corners of theglobe started to flock to Davenport.In 1910 the school was still in 'itsinfancy. The entire student body atthat time was not as large as a single class at the school to-dav Butsteadily the institution grew. Onei"ifivvcuicul lonowed another. Onepiece of property after another wasacquired and one new building followed another.The early history of the P. S.

Palmer was always a staunchbeliever in publicity. Printers' inkwas his friend from the start and hisfirst move was to send out pamphletsexplaining chiropractic. It was inthis way that he drew students to hisschool. The present school at thetop of Brady street is a monument ofconstuctive advertising and a continued campaign of publicity.Dr. Mohney stated that one of themost artistic floats in the .big parade,and which attracted a great deal cfinterest, was one placed by the Kentucky Chiropractors, winning secondprize.

That's nothing, asthose who sit through the movie serials week after week no doubt think.It is said to be more economicalin average experience tp use a taxi-cab than to maintain an automobile,and employ a chauffeur, but the way'to make taxicabs fashionable is toput out propaganda to the contrary.rTo .give the quadruped his due, thefour-footed porker is never guilty, ofsuch acts of piggishness and destructiveness as commonly are done by thedrunken 'hog driving an automobile.Paris has a number of these animals.The Paris girl who keeps a diaryrarely ever makes therein this entry:"Washed the dishes for mother thismorning," not because it would becommonplace record, but because shedidn't.The only time we have ever aspired to be a moving picture" acturwas once or twice when we wishedwe were close enough to some of theso-called "comedians" of the HankMann stripe 'to join in hitting 'him inthe solar plexus 'or some other .placewhere it would do the most good.We do not know whether insectscan reason, as a scientist suggests,but we do know that a mosquitoknows how to get through a windowscreen and find you in the dark, orto find the way through an openwork stocking, either in the light ordarkness.

The citystreet cleaning department gives thestreets a course of "dry cleaning.''Hence the dust and hence "tli2charge of the broom brigade."Ever notice the broom brigade atwork on Paris pavements early inthe morning?

His vocabularyimmediately expanded. Althoughaccustomed to the use of slang hismother was quite shocked when sheheard him say one evening as he waspreparing for bed:"Now I lay me down to sleep,I pray the Lord my soul to keep,If I should die before. I wakeWell, I should worry!"We confess to a great deal of disappointment. As we note, withconsiderable satisfaction, the increasing tobacco territory signed up, aswe preceive that what began as adream is Ifkely to end as a realizableasset, we marvel how the anti-tobaccocrusaders can be so supino.We do not hear them, sounding -thealarm and they seem wholly to neglect an opportunity left promisingby the demise of boozers. As for ourselves, we smoke several kinds, thankyou.It's a waste of time to experimentwith liniments and plasters whenyou have a dull, throbbing backacheor sharp, stabbing twinges.

Reports of the experiments, made public by an armyaviation statement, said progress wasbeing made with devices adaptedfrom studies of the bats which wouldact as preventatives against collisions of aircraft. According to thestatement, the scientists blindfoldeda number of bats and released' themin a room which was crossed withmany wires and partitioned from another room by a gird containingholes just large enough for the batsto fly through. The result was thatthe flying bats never touched a wireand flew through the holes with ease.The experiments revealed the bats'secret. They were found to emit anote, often inaudible to the ear,which would bound back from thewires and partition, conveying accurate information to the bats' sensitiveears and enabling them to map outspace with, exactness.Aeronautical experts believe thatairmen can do the same thing. TheBritish are busy devising instruments to that end, and their effortsare said already to have led to thedevelopment of instruments whichare expected to record for airmensounds as thev anDroach objects. It.is said that this information is. expected to be supplied equally as wellin the dark or mist as in clear atmosphere.TALL RACING OPENS AT LATONIA TO-MOBROWWordsworth and Mountains.De Quincey tells us that Wordsworth was impatient when anyone elsespoke of mountains, as if he had apeculiar property in them.

Ladies,notwithstanding that we love youbetter than a sheep loves alfalfa,but we always have known thatyour angencai assertions and yourenthusiastic acclamations of moralsuperiority is a proclamation without basic grounds of argument.From statistical and psychologicalinvestigation and from daily observation we discover that it takes something more than mere blood, muscle,tissue and bone to make a man or awoman. This is a dip into deep' theology and we leave it to the preachers to tell us why the hearts of thefemale sex are purer and holier thanthe male, and if they will with boasted purity, noble ideas, sanctity ofpurpose and with their long covetedprivileges convert this nation into aland of purity, prosperity, peace andtranquility.
