totraverse the Boer lines gives an interesting account of the fighting duringthe last week in October The correspondent saysAfter the failure to rush the townGen Cronje had recourse to the tacticsemployed during the siege of Potchefstroom in 1881 making an advance tothe town by a succession of trenchesin echelonSuch a movement had been anticipated by us for some time and forthat reason there had been sent outparties to worry the Boers incessantlyby night attacks These tactics theenemy disliked but he contented himself with a daily shell fire which exposed him to little personal risk ThenCol Baden Powell played his trumpcard by sending out Fitzclarencesparty to worry the occupants of thetrenches The little force stole outsilently in the darkness No shot wasCred and the men with fixed bayonetscreeping rather than walking alonggradually approached the chief Boerposition near the race course Thenas they closed in there was a shrillscreech It was Fitzclarences whistleand the signal for the onslaughtA ringing British cheer which thelisteners back in camp caught up wasthe only reply as the party dashed intothe trenches There was a fearfulstruggle the attacking forces catchingand bayoneting the Boers under thetarpaulins where they crouched crying for mercy At least 50 bayonetsgot to work and the havoc theywrought was terribleFor just a moment there was nosystematic return fire bt then a perfect hailstorm of bullets poured infrom the trenches to the rear Againfitzclarences whistle sounded Itmeant cease firing and scatter homeward The British forces scatteredsilently creeping back under thefurious fire in the darkness to the appointed rendezvous where the roll wascalledSunday passed quietly the volunteer band playing in the womanslaager All Sunday night the Boerspoured a rifle fire into the town Itwas set going after dinner Sundayevening when Col Baden Powellhoisted a red lamp on the commonagewhich was the scene of Capt Fitzclarences night attack The ruse answered splendidly The moment thelight appeared the Boers opened fireimmediately and the fire lasted thewhole night throughThere had been a tremendous wasteof ammunition Indeed it is estimated 30 000 rounds of ball cartridgewere wasted on the occasion of thenight attack on the Boer trenchesThe shelling continued all Sundayat intervals About 4 oclock in theafternoon Gen Cronje sent in a flag oftruce giving Mafeking a last chanceto surrender at the eleventh hourWhile the flag was receiving attentionthe heavy bombardment continuedThe end came says the correspondent after five hours fighting Theenemy retired being heavily beatenfor all time so far as Mafeking is concerned It was the hottest day of thesiege and the firing was terrific theBoers evidently recognizing that theway into Mafeking if any is by a kopjewhich was gallantly defended by ColWalfords menThe garrison is jubilant while theBoers have been hurled back in disorder on their laager and

in smoke Putting on full steam the Ceres soonreached the Patria and sending a boatlearned that Capt Frolich was inurgent need of assistanceThe boats were got out and withdifficulty all the Patrias passengersnumbering 150 were transferred to theCeres which proceeded for Doverwhere she arrived just before midnightFrancis W Prescott the UnitedStates consul in Dover was immediately notified and he consulted with theharbor authorities who arranged tosend out the harbor tug Lady Vitawhich brought the rescued ashoreAmong the saved are many ladies andchildren as well as six babes in armsThe hurry of the rescue was indicated by the fact that most of themwere enveloped in blankets only Theywere rapidly distributed among thehotels or sent to the Sailors home andeverything possible is being done fortheir comfortAccording to interviews with someof the passengers which elicited thefact that most of them are Americancitizens who have come for a vacationin Europe all were ordered on deck at6 oclock Wednesday morning whenthey were informed that a disastrousfire had broken out among the generalcargo and as the crew were unable tomaster it the captain said he considered it advisable for the passengers totake to the boats At this time it wasevident that the fire had obtained athorough hold upon the cargo Smokeand flames were ascending with overpowering force and causing the greatest alarmThe crew according to several passengers worked like heroes in theirendeavors to keep the flame underbut the great quantity of linseedamong the cargo and the oil suppliedby this made all their efforts hopelessThere was very great excitementamong the women and children butthe example set by the coolness ofCapt Frolich and the crew had a calming effect on the passengers generallyThe boats were promptly got overthe side the crew working as if theywere at drill The safety of the ladiesand the children was the first considratiou As the fire had by this timeconsumed the greater part of the passengers belongings they had to getinto the boats as they had come upfrom their bunks and some iv verylight raimentThe scene was a strkug one withsome touching pects as husbandsand fathers parted from wives andchildren Although everything wascarried out under the most trying conditions thanks to the coolness of thecaptain and crew there was no panicand all of the passengers being gotteninto the boats aid into two fishingboats said to belong to Yarmouthwhich had come up in the meantimeJust as this had been effected a largesteamer was seen to be making for theburning liner She proved to be theCeres which first sent a boat and thenpicked up all the Patrias passengersThe Ceres offered also to take off CaptFrolich and the crew but the latterpreferred to remain by the vessel solong as there was any chance of saving her although there was the greatest danger in doing so her hull beingred hot at the time and there beingevery evidence that she would burnfor a considerable periodThe passengers say they learnedfrom the officers that Capt Frolichhopes to put his steamer ashore atsome point on the coast where therewill be a possibility of saving herThe scheme is a bold one and doescredit to a gallant crew and which itis hoped may be successfulThe passengers who had bad nothing to eat since half past 7 Wednesdaymorning were treated with the greatest kindness on being landed

Victoria where th ylearned they would arrive in time topurchase their outfit and catch thesteamer Islander which sailed on the13th of the month and was due in Dyeafive days laterAt Victoria they found the streetsthronged with men each with an earnest look on his face as he hustledabout They were from all walks in lifebut all animated by the same purposeSome were buying horses others learning to secure packs with the famousdiamond hitch which alone will answer the purpose Others were purchasing heavy woolens belts to wear aboutthe waist with flap- that buttoned downover the compartmentsExposed for sale on every hand werebuckskin bags to bold gold heavy ironshod shoes moccasins of moose hidewith socks as thick as a mans hand andreaching to the knee mittens hatsi oats flour bacon saddles coffee sacksand everything was for the KlondikeMen talked and thought of nothingelse All were interested Many ofthem were to sail on the Islander withour friends who were fortunately intime to secure passage Some were goincr bv one route and some bv anotherafter reaching Skaguay but no oneseemed to mention the Dalton trail afact which both Tom and his friendmarked with satisfactionThe purchase of an outfit would havebeen a serious stumbling block but forthe advice of the storekeepers whohowever were not only very honestbut very well posted as to the requirements of a miner Toms knowledgeof horses came in very handily and hesoon found six good animals whichpromised to serve his purpose To getthese and the other purchases on boardthe steamer in time kept both men verybusy but it was safely accomplishedat last and they saw Victoria fadeaway astern as the stout steamer madeher way up the inland channel twodays laterThe voyage of nearly 1000 miles wasmade without accident but our friendswere anything but comfortable Thesteamer was packed with miners andthe hold was lull of horses the latterbeing cramped for space owing to thegreat number shipped They requiredgreat care but although many diedon the trip Tom succeeded in preserving those he had bought as they werevastly superior to most of their companionsAn hour or two was spent at Juneauwhere the steamer stopped but therain was falling in a steady drizzlewhich made the steamers deck preferable to sightseeing In fact for theprevious two days she seemed to haveentered a land of perpetual fog andrainAt the entrance of the Lynn canal thecaptain was obliged to anchor on aceonnt of the fog nd the passengerstook advantage of the delay to arrangefor the landing of their goods for thetransportation company took no responsibility more than to deliver themat the rail This was soon done and avote of thanks passed the captain forhis courtesy on the voyage Then someone started a song and all joined witha will till the air rang with the unusual noiseSuddenly the fog lifted from thefrowning hills the anchor was weighedand the argonauts saw a number ofvessels ahead of them while just beyond was a faint streak of whitesparkling in the fitful sunshine acrossa little valley at the edge of a bay onthe right hand with the steep hills rising on either side their tops lost in thecanopy of cloudsBeyond the line of white were greentrees and far away stretched a levelvalley winding among the hills andgrowing blue and faint in the distanceThat is Skaguay bay said the captain to the eager questioners and youcan see the White pass way off there inthe distanceA shout went up at the welcomenews and then as the steamer movedslowly into the little bay the whitestreak resolved itself into tentsstretched across a level plain for aspace of half a mile and fronting titwaterTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY NOYEMBER 17 1899As the anchor chain went rattling Ithrough the hawse pipes the steamerwas surrounded by a fleet of rowbeatsand Siwash canoes trying to pick uppassengers On the beach could be seenthe large scows used for unloading thehorses and the passenger were eagerto go ashore This could not be donehowever until the captain came backwith the customs officerThe beach at Skaguay is low andruns out several hundred yards beforedropping off into deep water At lowtide this is all bare so steamers areforced to lie outside and try to unloadat high tideTom and Green were to continue rourmiles further to Dyea but as theyfound it impossible to secure a scow totow their horses and outfit to thatport they were forced to leave themon the steamer until she finished hertrip after unloading the bulk of herfreight at SkaguayWhen the customs officer had madehis visit the two friends went ashore ina rowboat and took their first glimpseof a typical mining townWhat a scene it was Crowds of menrowing in boats to the beach thenclambering out and carrying theirgoods above the reach of the tide andpiling them in little heaps on theground Horses tethered singly and ingroups Tents of every si and kindand men cooking over sheet iron -lovesset outside IMles of goods were onevery hand and men could be seenloading horses and starting off towarda sort of lane in the direction of a smallgrove of cottonwoods beyond whichwas the trail to the famous White passRough frame buildings were croingnp on every hand as fast b man couldhandle the material all of which wereto be turned into stores when completed Outfits bought and sold wasa familiar sign and the stars andstripes floating over a tent announcedthe presence of a United States courtcommissionerIt required two days to unload thefreight here and then the Islanderproceeded to Dyea where withoutaccident Tom and his friends succeeded in landing their outfit and settingup their tentWhen everything was done it wasdark and to Toms delight the secondmate proved an excellent hand to cookThey made a hearty meal lit theirpipesand then Tom saidTo morrow we must see if we canfind the man Averys letter told aboutthe one who was coming here aftersupplies this spring It said he wouldbe

fiendish eyebrows descending to the nose in sharp archeswere natures warning to his fellowsObed Riders hurts had proved moreserious than he had at first imaginedThe broken ribs pained him wheneverhe moved and he was almost helplessThis man who was known as HankBowers was a desperate character whohad lost his last ounce at the gamingtable He attached himself to themate with a view to robbing him at thefirst opportunity but the latter finding him to be utterly unscrupuloushad decided to enlist his services inhis own schemesOn the very night Tom landed atDyea he was making the offer Hefirst informed his new friend that hisname was Avery then showed the letter from the old miners partner alsothe will drawn up on shipboardThe other laughed insolently iu hisface as he went on and

conspirators continued toplot against the lives and wealth oftheir fellowsThey had decided to start at once ontheir villainous errand and the following morning they were astir before daylight They wished to avoid observationas much as possible and but few people saw them as they loaded theirhorsestBowers was attending to this whenObed Rider who had been bringing thegoods to him remembered that he hadleft some articles to dry on a smallbush not far away and hurried afterthemBv this time it was broad davbghtand fires were being started in thestoves here and there He was passingclose behind one of these when suddenly his heart seemed to leap into histhreat for a voice he could not mistakesounded clearlyHello Ireen Youre up earl v MyAint I sleepyIt was Tom Scotts voice and themate stopped

gasp of relief the mateslouched his hat over his eyes and hurried away from the spot as though aghost were pursuing him He did notstop until he had joined Bowers who atonce noticed his disordered appearanceand exclaimedWhats up pard You look like yerwas scared ter deathHes here 1 saw them just nowWhats that Saw whoScott And Ireen is with himAnd who the devil is Scott andGreen Cant yer talk

andGreen were discussing their rude breakfast in blissful ignorance of how narrowly they had missed the man whothey fully believed to hare alreadyreached the writer of tin lost letterAlthough they were eager to be oft atonce it was impossible to start till thehorses had fully recovered from thesesi aSvoyage They were too val uable to takeany chances with and one of them wasslightly lame from a fall in his crampedquarters on the steamer To replace ananimal was also impossible or fabulous prices were being offered for anything that X uId by any possibility beara burdenThe gain it was necessary to makea careful search about the camp to seeif the man Tarbox mentioned in theletter had arrived yet If they couldfind him all would be plain sailing andhe could pilot them back There wasalso a chance that the dead minersbrother might be even then on the spotBut they found it a difficult task toget any information The populationof the camp was changing daily Xoone paused longer iau was absolutely-necessary and each was too busvwith his own affairs to take notice ofothersBesides this thev were oblijred toavoid giving many details which mightperhaps have helped them and at theclose of the second day Tom said asthey sat in front of their tent smokingIts no use Green We might as wellbe off and trust to luck We cant askwhat we want to know without arousing suspicion and

darknessIleip HelpThe two men sprang to their feetTom was a little in advance as theydashed off in the direction of the criesand was first to arrive at a little opening where a red shirted figure

every human life that never is seen in print andeven under our very eyes there areoften victories won and trials undergone that we never know No battleship was ever more thoroughly protected by its armor of steel than is thehuman heart by its physical coveringSome people are more easily read thanothers but the most frank and opencountenance often shields its secretsand romances from other eyes TheEnglishman believes that a mans houseis his castle It is the universal beliefthat a mans heart is his fortressThere doors are shut that no guns ormachines of war can batter down thewindows are impenetrable Yet within all may be bright and cheerful andhappy and not a ray of light reach theI outer world Or the exterior may preserve its gay and careless appearancewhen all within is dark and full ofmourning No one can tell what is going on in any others breast Howcareful therefore should we be Asingle sharp word or a thoughtless remark may touch the quick and bringuntold painBut it is not always thus Some daythere comes a time and a friend fotfwhom the doors are thrown wide backand the windows opened to the lightThere is a full and free narration of allthat has gone on It is good for theheart for the confession is light andfresh air to the close and molding mansion There is joy indeed when a heartfinds a confidant to whom it can unburden its joys and cares and friendshipis strengthened 30 that it seems it cannever be broken But alas it is toooften the that a word or a deedmisunderstood causes the keeper ofthe fortress to close its doors and blindits windows This is the

husbands and wives really do livehappy even afterOf course they do love may changefor the better but it chuiges all thelame A time comes wh the manstops worshiping the WOBiM as an impossibly superior being and JCnows sheis only his fellow creature aler ailnot his superior perhaps not even hisequal But if the woman is wise andtakes the change as a matter of coursenot resenting the loss of worship butmakes herself sweeter and more desirable as a fellow -creature than shewas as a mere ideal then providedthe man is worth loving the very bestsort of love beginsBut it is a dangerous time Theworst danger is that another womanshould appear on the scene in the character of the impossibly superior beingjust when the husband has begun tosee faults in the wife Such a womanwould have been no cause of dangerbefore that time of change she wouldbe no danger when once it was safelypast but if she chances to appearjust at the dangerous moment there isno saying what may happenThese words weighed heavily onpretty little Beatrice Farleighs mindas she rode alone except for the guardianship of her groom to the meet atTarent End They had been spoken longpg o by dear kindly prosy old GenTarent who knew the world but managed somehow to love it no less forknowing itWell she was married now and thetime of change had come her husbandwas quite aware of her faults Heknew she had a temper that shecould make sharp speeches ami waslot always quite in the right when shequarreled with her friends That waswhy he had laughed at her dislike ofMrs CasilisHe had gone as far as laughing ather when he thought her in thewrong her words were no longer theinspired utterances of an angel Butaffectionately there was nohe laughedtrace of that sneer that tells a womanshe mav as well give up the fight forlove is so

me I couldalmost hope shell get a spill Wellits my chance to day I may be a dulllittle thing compared to her but I canride and he and she shall see it todayGen Tarent turned from a group ofmen with whom he was eagerly discussing some matter of local politics tohelp her to alight his manner was unusually kind and fatherly He gave herin charge of Dick Atterbury to be takeninto the house and fed Dick hadseemed to be waiting there on purposeThe last time she had seen Dick tospeak to they had parted very bitterlyShe had refused him telling him of herengagement to Lord Farleigh and Dickhad seemed to think he had been treated badly He had said hard things anddeclared he would never willingly speakto her again Since then he had avoided her so far as he could do so withoutopen rudeness To day he was horriblykind and respectfulHad it gone so far alreadj then Didthe people know that the time wascome for her friends to stand round herso to speak offering comfort and protectionJust opposite her husband and MrsCasillis had risen from the table MrsCasillis was very tall and goddess likewith a delicatelj arched nose and fairhair raised softly from a low foreheadBeatrice turned and caught Dick looking at her tooMrs Casilis is one of the most beautiful women I ever saw she saidcalmlyI dont admire her in the leastsaid Dick and Beatrice hated him forhaving so little tact that he let his resentment tell in his voiceShe rose impatiently and managed tolose Dick in the crowd but he was waiting by her mare when she was ready tomount She hated him more than everWasnt it kind of Lord Farleigh tolend me Telegram Mrs Casilis saidas they were together for a momentwhile the huntsmen threw the houndsinto the cover Do you think I shallbe able to manage himOf course Beatrice said cheerfullyTed wouldnt have let you ride him ifthered been any doubt about itShe felt rather than saw her husbands glance of shamefaced approvaland resented itWe will both keep you in sight shecontinued to see how you get onBeatrice had not been in earnest whenshe had spoken of keeping in the neighborhood of herhushard and Mrs Casilisand yet they never seemed out of hersight even when she tried to avoidI them chance or some involuntary instinct on her part would bring thethree togetherHer plucky little mare went that dayas she had never gone before and morethan once when she found herself closeupon the two big horses though shewas conscious that her presence wasan annoyance to both their riders shesaw a look of reluctant admiration onher husbands faceAfter a sharn scamper the houndsoverran the scent and a fresh cover wastried and again with success Reynardburied away against the windBeatrice saw Mrs Casilis settle herself in her saddle with an air that saidplainly that she meant to leave her wellbehind this time The mare cant holdout much longer Beatrice saw herlips move and guessed at the wordsTed and his companion were aheadShe almost lost sight of them The other womans golden hair flashed in thelight before her eyes and almost blindedherBut the fox doubled An easy rideacross grass and an easy jump over alow fence brought her alongside of herhusband and Mrs Casilis just when itseemed thev least exoected her TheyM xwere going gently to cut across the loopthat the hounds were making andcome up with them a couple of fieldsaheadTheir horses were close togetherThey were talking eagerly as they rodeFarieigh saw Beatrice first and his facedarkenedGood heavens Beatrice do youthink I need a chaperon he saidYes I do she said sharply throughher clenched teethWell shes undertaken more thanshe can manage and Mrs CasilislaughedBeatrice was not meant to hear thewords she knew so much but her husband hod been meant to hear them theother woman dare sneer at her to himThis was the end then the fight waslost Her life was not to be beautifulany more but pitiable and contemptible Pity and ridicule that was whatshe was to have in future instead oflove and honor and she would have tojro on living as if it didnt hurtShe saw all her f iff lire life before herin the few moments it took to cross thefield An uncared for wife frettingalone at home till she grew old or elsea wife like others she knew very smartand much talked of in the papers always well dressed and brilliant and interested in something seeing her husband now and then at other peopleshouses and all the while loving him sohorriblyShe had swerved aside as Mrs Casilisspoke the meadow they were crossinglay on a hillside and sloped gentlydown to her left She was riding some20 yards to the right of the others anda little ahead of Mrs Casilis Her husband had left his place at the lattersside and was about 30 yard slower downthe hill considerably ahead of both theothersBetween this field and the next was apretty stiff fence with a deep ditch onthe other side of it Beatrice did notfear it she had taken it before MrsCasilis was riding at the fence with easyconfidence if she did not know of thefence her horse did ahe would clear it1 ail tUTed was over Beatrice could just sehis hat over the top of the hedge Heseemed to be pulling up returning evidently to be near Mrs Casilis againMrs Casilis was close on the fencenow riding with over confidence andtoo fast She was looking at Beatriceand at the very moment while shelooked Beatrice felt that her poor wornout little mare was going to refuse thefence she saw an expression of triumph rise in the face of her rival hersuccessful rival and heard her laughThen all the misery and bitterness inthe jealous wifes heart changed suddenly into a frenzy of hate All the little fits of anger that she had indulgedin and repented of in all her life seemedmerely amusing beside it They hadbeen as the waving of the hand of somehidden half sleeping fury that awokenow and showed itself a giant it tookpossession of her and mastered herKill her ride at her and kill hershe shant triumphThe evil impulse only lasted a moment the turning of a wrist and heelnext second she would hava given herlife to stop the mare but it vas too lateThe infamy of the act appalled hershe tugged at the reins with all herforce but in vain The other womansface ugly with fear and spite seemedelose on her ownO God dont let me do a thing likethis she gasped Kill me but dontlet me doit Stop it somehow 1 cantShe threw all her weight on the rightrein Next moment there was a shocka slighter shock than she had expected a moment of uncertainty and thenshe and her mare fell together amongthe grass of the bank Mrs asilisvoice was ringing in her ears She rodeat me Ted the wicked woman rode atmeShe did not hear the answer to thatthe next thing she knew was that shewas sitting on the bank Her husbandwas gently bathing her face with a wethandkerchiefYoure all right old girl he saidyoure not hurt a bitHis voice was more loving than shehad ever heard it before She pushedthe handkerchief away puzzledTake a pull out of my flask Tedsaid We mustnt have you showingthe white feather now my dear Itwas the pluckiest thing i ever sav inmy life The whole field is praisingvouMAFut she told you I heard her say Irode at

bank away just whereshed have taken the fence 1 saw itand rode back tc stop her but 1shouldnt have been in time Your riding at her was the one thing that couldhave saved her but your swerving ofljust at the right moment so that youwere spilt and she wasnt well thatwas splendid my dear and Ill neveiforget itShe knew by his face what he meantOther people began to offer congratulations and praises But some one hada carriage close by and was putting itat her disposal She could not collectherself sufficiently to speak but heihusband accepted the offer for her Helifted her into the seat then he got inbeside herYou are coming she said Ithought doesnt Mrs Casilis expectyou to take her homeMy dear Ted looked very reproachful You are not hurt I know but ofcourse you are shaken a little

likedthis none the less for its having its definite limitations as to pecuniary obligations and the like including everything-in the nature of treatinc allthis being in my opinion a weak pointin our more gushing or more self-conscious habit 1 remember to have oncebeen taken by a gentleman on whom Ihad but the slightest claim to thecountry house of another on whom Ihad no claim whatever The latter wasnot at all literary and had not even theusual vague English interest in American affairs yet he gave up his wholeafternoon to drive me to Kenilworthwhich he had seen a thousand timesBut that for which 1 liked him bestand which afforded me a wholly newexperience was that as we entered theouter doorway he going tirt lookedback over his shoulder and said simplyThev make vou pay threepence foradmission here and then added speaking to the attendant here is mythreepence After all the t ie andtrouble he had given to his M rangerguest he yet left him to pay ris ownthreepence a thing which most Americans would not have dreamed of doingIt would have been the American dotion of good breeding to save a guestfrom expense as it was tie English impulse to save him from tie sense of obligation

languageof the people of Holland They speakDutch as their forefathers in Hollandspoke it and speak it now They arecalled Boers because that is a Dutchword which describes them It meansa farmer and agriculture is the mainpursuit of the compatriots of OomPaul A knowledge of Dutch wouldsupply an explanation of the odd looking words that are used now and thenin the news reports from the republicIt would also enable one to pronouncethese words as they should be enunciatedDutch diphthongs are not given thesame sounds as their equivalents inEnglish The double o for instancein Dutch has the same sound as o inRome while the diphthong oe is pronounced by the Dutch as we pronounce00 in boot The English pronunciation of these two diphthongs is the reverso of that given them by those whospeak Dutch And ou has the soundof uw in owl The sound of ur isnearly like that of the English oy inboy The Dutch aa is the same asthe English a in war As there isno y in Dutch its place is taken by4ij

that itis especially hard to get a clover orgrass seeding with Where wintergrain is not grown and oats are thechief small grain grown one failure toseed is apt to be followed by othersuntil tbe land becomes so exhaustedthat neither oats nor grass can begrown Most of these failures to seedwith spring grain come from plowingthe land in early spring thus turningup a lower strata of soil that has notbeen properly mellowed by freezingThe remedy for this is to fall plow theland leaving it rough and then so soona it is fit to work cultivate it lightlyand put in the grain and grass seedb vre plowing can be done If a frostfreezes the soil an inch or two after thegruiii and grass seed are sown it willbe ail the better for both If the secondcrop of oats fails to give a grass andclover seeding plow the stubble in thefall after the oats are off and sow wheator re seeding with grass seed in thefall and with clover seed in the springThis rarely fails to give a good grasscatch and if the season be favorablethere will be some clover with it evenon poor thin soil Prairie ParmerHow to Handle Kaffir FodderThere is quite a difference in opinioLas to the best method of handling Kaffirfodder when it is planted thickly andis to be used for feeding and winteringstock cattle In general it is believedthat the fodder should be cut andplaced in small shocks when the grainshave passed from the soft stage andbecome firm The fodder will yet begreen and if put in large shocks willspoil but will be excellent feed it properly shocked In feeding it when prepared in this way the amount givenshould not be more than the cattle williat up reasonably clean if too much isgiven they will eat only the heads andwast a large portion of the fodderFaimers ReviewAlfalfa on Tr in SoilsIt

exposed tc the sudden changes and bleak storms of winter is not conducive to success in thebeginning The careful successful beckeeper would as soon think of wintering his cow in this manner as his beeswhich under proper care would yieldunder the investment equally as muchprofitThere are two means of successfulwintering First packed on the summer stand second in a well ventilatedcellar The first is by far the most laborious yet it has some advantagesCellar wintering is the least pensiveit is only necessary to keep them inEgyptian darkness and as quiet as possible carrying them out on two orthree bright days for a fly during theentire winter The temperature required is about that which will keeppotatoes successfully They remain ina semi dormant state and consume butlittleMost everyone has his or her favoritelocation for the apiary Some choosethe most shaded point possible Afterexperimenting for several years wehave determined that in my locality atleast the most exposed place possibleis prolific of the best results In thecountry between the Missouri river andthe mountains the nights are usuallycool and we find that the mercury fallstwo or three degrees lower in the shadethan on the open ground that it requires a much longer time to warm upthe hive in the shade in the morningthan those not shaded and besidesthis the sun comes out so warm ia themorning that often before the coloniesin the shade are warmed up the sunhas evaporated a great portion of thenectarIt is with the bee as with tie farmhand the fellow who gets out early inthe morning is the one who usuallyaccomplishes the greatest day s workIn experimenting with the matter oilocation we find that the colony locatednearest the shade gathers the leaststores while those located on the mostexposed ground gather most One casein particular was a colony shaded by asmall plum tree As the tree grew thecolony produced less stores until itbarely gathered sufficient to winter itself We moved this colony out into thesunlight and it went back to its old record in honey making E Whitcomb inFarm and HomeAMONG THE POULTRYDo not omit the cleaning Up procealduring the moulting seasonGrowing birds
