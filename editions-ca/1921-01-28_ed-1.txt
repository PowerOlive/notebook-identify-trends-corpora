But what wewant to know is, do they stand thegreatest test of all the test oflime? Here is conclusive evidenceon this point from a Paris man:Phillip M. Heller, proprietor meatmarket, 314 Second street, says:"I have used Doan's Kidney Pills afew times in the past and have beengreatly benefited by them. Whenever my back has been weak orlame or my kidneys have acted toofrequently, causing me to get upduring the night, a box of Doan'sKidney Pills, which I get at Varden & Son's Drug Store has alwaysgiven fine relief. 1 certainly thinkDoan's are a splendid remedy andgladly recommend them to anyone."(Statement given November 91916.)On November 12. 1920, Mr. Heller said: "I am glad to say thecure Doan's Kidney Pills made fome has been a lasting one. All Isaid m the past in favor of them Inow confirm- for I think just ashighly of Doan's to-day as I everdid."Price 60c, at all dealers.

January production of butter is reported above normal. Due to theincreasing supplies, the marketshave worked lower during the week.The S. S Frederick VIII arrivedat New York during the week witha cargo of approximately 2,000,000pounds of Danish butter. Furtherimportations are expected in February, as Danish buHer is offered atprices below the present quoted markets. Danish butter is of generallybetter quality than the average makeof the creameries in the CentralStates. Producers should recognizethe necessity for improving thequality of cream delivered to stations, thereby enabling the creameries to make better butter, whichwill compete with the Danish product. Due to the mUd weather throughout i he- producing section, receiptsof eggs are showing a material increase, with lower prices prevailingin all the larger (markets.Poultry receipts are below currentrequirements, and some stock is being withdrawn from storage.

The handwriting hasnot been identified as ofany member of the family -nor doesH appear to some from a lead penoiior ink. but is plainly visible, workec'into and apparently pai t of the hardened shell of the egg- How the Jotters got there is a mystery. No explanation has yet been found. Neighbors viewed the egg. Mrs. Faulkner, family and friends are greatlyexcited over it. Photographs weretaken and one offer of $25 for thestrange trophy was refused. Theegg, after being shown in Woodbine,was brought to Corbin and exhibUedat a local drug store. Part of theegg was soft, but the letters appear,it is said, on the hardshell part. Itwas not broken, is of normal size,and was taken from the nest byMrs. Faulkner herself, who was firsrto discover the inscription.Notice tothePublicaElectrical wirirg aiid repairwoik a specialty.

A committee from the cutout growers' meeting in Lexington,. Saturday,called on him and explained theirprogram and asked that he issue astatement endorsing it.Incidentally, the anti-trust law wasdiscussed with the Governor and Attorney General Charles I. Dawson,who assured them that the programdoes not come within the purview ofthe law. This question was "raisedat the Lexington meeting.y E. L.Harrison, of Lexington, secretary of the Growers' and presidentof the Farmers' Union, told GovernorMorrow that the Union and the County Farm bureaus form, the nucleus forquickly organizing the movement in amajority of the Burley counties ofKentucky, and both are cooperating.He said in twenty-six of the fortyfour Burley counties the Union has7,000 members, while the FarmBureaus are strong in several others.The following counties are in theBurley district: Adair, Anderson, Barren, Bath, Boone, Bourbon, Boyle,Bracken, Carroll, Carter, Casey,Clark, Fayette, Fleming, Franklin,Uallatin, Grant, Greenup, HardinHarrison, Hart, Henry, Jessamine,Kenton, Larue, Lewis, Madison,"Marion, Meade, Mercer and Metcalfe,and Switzerland, Jefferson, Clark,Franklin and Ripley county, Indiana;Hamilton, Clermont, Brown, Butler,Adams and Highland counties, Ohio,and Hamblin, Hawkins, Greene andWashington counties, Tennessee.The committee which called uponGovernor Morrow was composed ofMr. Harrison, Frank McKee, , ofWoodford county; Abe Renick,' ofWinchester; Charles Long, of Carrollton; C. O. Hampling, Boone county,and G. A. Brooke, of Mayslick.Governor Morrow's Statement.-I am now, and have been deeplyinterested in and distressed over-thetobacco situation in Kentucky. Thereis no doubt that the price now beingpaid for tobacco throughout theState does not represent more thanhalf the cost of its production."Under high prices formerly paidby buyers, the manufactured producthas sold readily and at a very substantial and handsome profit to themanufacturer, but at the very gretelyreduced price offered for the presentcrop, no substantial hope is held outthat the finished product will be soldat any reduced price. If the farmeror the tenant sells his crop at theprice now offered, he wall not receivesufficient money to meet his obligations, settle his accounts at stores andbanks, nor to make payments otherwise incident to growing the crop."I believe in- the right and thenecessity of the tobacco growers ofKentucky to form a voluntary organization for their mutual protection;for the marketing their crops and for iestablishing and creating conditionsthat will bring about actual and hon-jest competition m the purchase oftheir crops."The farmers of the State now findthemselves at selling time without anyplan for marketing of their cropsunder competitive conditions. Toplace the present crop upon the market under these conditions, it appearsto me, will not result in betteringtheir financial condition, but will onlyadd to the difficulties of the situation.It appears to me that the farmer hasmuch to gain and nothing to lose bywithholding his present crop from themarket until the growers of the State'shave had an opportunity to take stockof the situation and perfect an organization and plans to meet it."I am very anxious to be of servicein every way possible to the greattobacco growing industry of theState; to be helpful to those interested m the production of the crop andto assist in a solution of the situationwhich will bring to the growers a fairand equitable price.""EDWIN P.

Here is a choice bitfrom this new evsngel now sweeping the country under the auspicesof the Anti-Saloon League spirits:"Too long have the people of theearth clung to the fleshpots, andtheir doom is as certain as that ofTyre and Sodom. Europe is theSodom and America the Gomorrah,and only the immediate return tothe Puritanical religious precepts ofthe witch-burning days fan save theearth from destruction."It clearly is to be seen that thisapostolic prophet nf doom would rejoice in lighting the faggots of the'funeral pyres whereon the unregenerate should die.This s talk merely a bit more extreme than now is heard on everyhand. But it represents the logicaloutcome of this menace to democracy if peimitted to have its intolerant way. This man and all hiskind represent something that wasthought to have been banished forever-from the world. He invokesdissensions, hatreds, intolerance, allthe black brood of evils whichcursed the earth Jirough eighteenbloody centuries. And he speaksthis creed openly in America!Rev. Dr. Niles Csrpenter, of Harvard University, is not of the ilk ofthe Tennessee divinity legislator.He recently declared that Sundayblue laws were un-Christian. Hefinds in recent schemes for socialreform all the essential elements ofBolshevism. He asserted that it wasnot Christian for any minority to decide what was best for a majority.that 3uch policies savor of Bolshevism, leading to such movements asthe blue law movement and the earner restiictive laws in this countryand England. JNEED KENTUCKY MAN INCABINETTHE(Courier-Journal).The glee with which some Democratic newspapers bail among thevariable and fluctuating rumorsfrom the haunts of the Presidentelect the report that Alvin T.Hert, of Kentucky, will not be amember of the 'Cabinet is incomprehensible, except as a manifestationof partnership as petty as it is provincial. The fact is that the Cabinet is going to be made up of Republicans from somewhere. It wouldbe a signal honor for Kentucky tchave one of its citizens in a positiomof such distinction in the place of acitizen of another State, with nogreater qualifications. If Kentuckyhad a sufficient number of Republicans of Cabinet caliber, we arefrank to say that we would takepride in seeing the entire Cabinetrecruited from them.
