It was estimated that 1,500 Knights and ladieswere in attendance on the opening dayof the two-days' session of the commandery. Ideal weather conditions prevailed inthe early morning Wednesday, thethreatening elements giving way towarm sunshine, but only for a fewshort hours, when a deluge drove themasses of humanity that lined thestreets to shelter, and marred theparade. Hundreds of peonle from surrounding towns were here to witnessthe parade.Main street, with the decorationsreplaced after the heavy rain and windstorm Tuesday night,, looked morebesutiful than before.The Paris Military Band, which hadbeen augmented to twenty-rive pieces,was engaged by Couer de Lion commandery No. 26,aof Paris, and met allincoming delegations of Knights andladies, and escorted them to the Reception Committee headquarters onBroadway, where they were nrovidedwith badges and programs and shownto their headquarters.The Richmond and Versailles commanderies were the first to arriveTuesday afternoon at 3 :80 o'clock.The Covington and Louisville commanderies came later in the day. TheNewport commandery arrived Wednesday morning, and on a special train theUeMolay commanaery arrived in thecity from Louisville. They carried abaggage car well filled with paraphernalia, refreshments, etc., and "wereprepared to have a royal good time., Webb commandtry, of Lexington,came over on two special cars on theinterurban line, and by the hour thechurch services began Wednesdaymorning all the 'cpmrnanderies hadrepresentatives in the" city to attendthe ceremonies.At 8:30 o'clock the commanderiesassembled at their headquarters andmarched to the Christian church,where the divine services were held.The church was crowded to overflowing, many being compelled to stand onthe outside. The auditorium was reserved for the Knights, while the Sunday school and lecture rooms were turned over to the spectators.Miss Betsy Kay presided at theorgan, and rendered a program ofchoice music while the audience wasassembling.After all were seated, a solemn hushfell upon the vast assemblage, whileSir Knight William Yoeman, RightEminent Grand Commander of Kentucky, announced the order ot theexercises.The invocation was pronounced bySir Knight Rev. Dr. B, M. Shive pastor or tne raris rresuyierien cnurcn,nd a member uf Couer de Lion commanderj No. 26.Sir Knight Hon. Claude M. Thomasthen voiced the welcome of the Pariscommandery and the people of Parisand Bourbon county to the visitors.He said that he should like to deliverthe keys of the city to the Knights,but that Mayor Hinton. who had neverunited with the Knights Templar anddoes not wear thej)lumes of the order,says he has made diligent search forthose keys which were delivered to theKnights'upon the occasion of cheir lastvisit, and has been unable to findthem. "This coming together in annual conclave to review everything thataffects the Master's cause, is like thecustom of the Knights of old who metonce every year about the famous tableat the feast of Pentecost to renewtheir vows of Knignthcod," said Mr.Thomas."A glorious day is ahead of us ifevery Knight will give all his time tothe service of the Blessed Redeemer,and will live up to the obligations as"Bourbon county is highly honoredby the presence of this army of plumed Knights, and a gracious cordialwelcome is extended you. "The addresswas followed by a response on behalf of the Grand Commandery bv SirKnight Rev. Robert J. Eamber, June rWarden of Versailles commandery Nc.3.The .response was courteous andgracious, the speaker saying that theKnights hoped to prove worthy of thekindness and hospitality extended tothem, and to prove also that Knighthood-isstill in flower. They, should beglad to appropriate everything insight, and to show that they were nothard to please nor to feed, as compared with a horse or an elephant."May the conclave of 1912 go downin .history. May this be one of thestrongest links in memory's golden.chain," said Mr. Bamber.Fcllowirg these addresses Rev.Carey E.

Bloomfield ET J 12-7IIIIiiGood Roads Moveirient.;The Democratic House of Representatives has given the good roadsmovement a flying start. This fact isof momentous importance to thepeople of this nation. Ever since theConstitution was written there hasbeen talk of imnroving the publichighways. It remained, for this, thefirst seBsion of the Sixty-second Congress, to actually do something towardbringing about that end. It requiredupward of a score of years to make astart toward stamping out railroad rebatmg'and the law prohibiting thatpractice was passed in a month afterthe start was made. Likewise thepure food law lagged for seventeenyears until an actual start was made.Within a few weeks after the talkingwas supplanted b.vaction the law became a reality.The Democrats in Congress hava injected the first breath of life into theagitation for better roads. The Househas actually passed a bill and as thematter now stands it is up to the Republican Senate and President to carrythe work along. If they refuse thepeople will know exactly where toplace the responsibility. Now that theDemocrats have taken a definite stepforward the issue becomes clear cutand direct.In all the Democratic speeches supporting the bill for road improvement,which was introduced by CongressmanDorsey W. Shackleford, of Missouri, itwas made plain that under fthe Democratic program it is proposed to spendthat money which is now wasted, forroad improvement.Every year the government spendsmillions of dollars for the upkeep ofnavy yards, which all naval expertsagree are useless. The Democratspropose to divert this money into theimprovement of the roads.Every year the governmnt spendsmillions of dollars for ornate publicbuildings in small towns winch couldget along with a less expensive building, such, for instance, as the 75,000postoffice in Sundance, Wyoming, townof 250 people. The Democrots dc notobject to a good, substantial post officewherever one is needed, but they belive. a part of this money would benefitmore people, and do more good ifspent on the public roads.At the present time there are inexistence numerous government "commissions," auch as the Canadian Boundary Commission, on which formerCongressman Tawney. of Minnesota,gets a salarj of $7,500 a year, .These& commissions seldom meet, and iheironly usefulness is to take care of"lame ducks." who fail of re-election-TheDemocrats propose to abolishthese commissions, and to spend theEoneyfor road imDrbvement."Improve the public roads withmoney that is now being wasted!" isthe Democratic battle cry.What Happens.Where some men fall down, othersget a firmer foothold.

MACY.It seems incredible that within the last seventy-five years little children were employed inthe coal mines of England andoften treated no better thanwork-animals, yet such was thecase. In 1842 a parliamentarycommission reported that inmany mines It was common forchildren to begin work underground at seven years old. Insome thev began at six, and Ina few instances as early as fiveyears old. One extreme casewas reported where childrenwere worked "as low as fouryears old," and "so young theyhad to be brought to work intheir bed-gowns." In anothercase, the report said, "Childrenare sometimes r brought! to thfc; jilt ,at,tbe aae .pf.sbjcfyears, and, Jare taien .out; or tied at - four,(OfcJock!

I she be be'autiful she grows into that mellowage without wrinkles and crowfeet; about the eyes or the blue circles underneath.It is invariably the rule that such women suffer little, or not at all, from womanlyderangements which sap the health and leave in the face the tell-talt; story of painand suffering. Dr.R.V.

From thepresent outlook there seems to be adearth of good hitters and as these arequite essental in pulling down gamesthe management should scout aboutjust a little in search of a few sluggers. It has been promised over andover again that Paris would have agood team to battle for the pennant,and the hooks are said to be out forseveral, but to this time none haveput in their appearance, with the exception of Rube Harold, who was secured from the Lawmakers.-President Bacon has had communications from several men and one or twoare said to be on their way, but whenthey will arrive is another matter.However it is hoped by the Paris fansthat the management will succeed before long in getting together an aggregation that can at least interest theother clubs and put up exhibitionsthat will entertain the fans whetherthey win or not.False Alarm.The fire department was called outyesterday afternoon about 5 o'clockin response to an alarm from box 18.A flue burning out in one of the houses opposite the Kelly stable on Seventh street was the cause of the alarm.Fire, wind and lightning insurance.

Perhaps you recall-how Ilabored with her under the mistakenidea that she was a newcomer in thisland of the free and that she waslooking for a job as cook when shecame to see us?""Yes, I remember," answered Helen,with a reminiscent giggle. "I'm sureif P hadn't had the presence of mindto explain to her that you were so pitiably near sighted you could scarcelydistinguish the faces of your mo9t intimate friends she would have turnedus all out of the cottage in her indignation. I hope I shall be forgiventhat very helpful little fiction aboutyour defective sight.""Do you recollect," Inquired Laurasternly, "that other occasion when Itold the gfrl who roomed next to usat St. Agnes' school that I had almostperished during the sermon' of thelong winded stranger preaeher whohad been inflicted on us in the chapelone morning?""Yes," responded Helen, cheerily,"and she told you with unnecessaryemphasis that the visiting clergymanwas her father! I haven't forgottenyour expression of dismay. It wastoo comical. And the enormous quantities of our precious goodies that youlavished upon her failed to soothe herinjured feelings.""Did I ever tell you," Laura askedagain with a grim countenance, "howlast summer I gratuitously and forcefully favored a Princeton freshmanwith my scathing opinion of any boywho couldn't pass his college entrance examinations? If I did tell youI must have added that T found outlater that he was conditioned on threestudies. Of course the bright littlesummer flirtation with him that I haddreamed of promptly shriveled into amere frigid acquaintance.""Why do you indulge in these painful reminiscences?" demanded Helen."Because of all the many malapropos things I have ever said or donethere is none other that equals mylatest. Helen, behold in me a quivering mass of contrition! I am thinking of having my horoscope cast bysome professional wizard in the hopeof discovering under which planet Iam especially prone to make unfortunate remarks to the horror of myselfand the indignation of my acquaintances. Then I could either have myself gagged or I could retire from society during that destructive period.""Your latest unfortunate remarkmust have been even worse than theone you made that time when youmentioned to ?lrs. Ackers out at thegolf club that you had greatly enjoyed being in a foursome with herson and she thereupon icily informedyou that she had no son and thatMr. Acker was her husbrnd.""Oh, that was a mere pleasantrycompared to the thorough manner inwhich I have forever lowered myselfin the opinion of my cousin, Tom Burrows. You know that I have alwaysadored dear old Tom and when heconfided to me a week ago that he wasengaged I was tremendously excited.I begged him to tell me the name ofthe lucky girl. He described all herCharms glowingly but refused to divulge her name just to tease me, Isupposed, for Tom has always been anincorrigible tease."Well, last evening at the Montrosedance Tom came to me and said thatthe time had come for the great meeting of his favorite cousin and hissweetheart."I eagerly followed him across thefloor to the side of a most attractivelooking girl. Then Tom actually introduced her to me as 'Miss Snicklefritz.' "'Oh Tom!' I exclaimed, reproachfully, 'How horrid of you!'"Then I turned to the girl and said,'Of course you've learned already thatmy cousin always has to have his little joke under all imaginable circumstances.' "Tom glared at me furiously, but Icouldn't understand why, so I continued as pleasantly as I could, 'Pleasetell me your real name.'" 'Snicklefritz,' she murmured."I almost collapsed. Do you wonderthat I feel it is necessary for me totake some kind of a cure? I. supposeTom will never forgive me.""Most certainly not, Laura' wasHelen's none too comforting assurance. "How could he, when the nameis doubtless a thorn in his flesh?Snicklefritz! Isn't it dreadful? Howdelighted she will be to change hername!"

Thecity had no fortifications butcrumbling walls, behind whichwere a few ancient cannon; butthe whole population, menwomen and children, rushed toits defervee. Bravest of them allwas Agustina. She was not awoman of quality, only a lemonade seller in the streets; but Isne perTormea mignty aeeas otvalor and by her example encouraged others to acts ofbravery. Once when a cannoneer fell mortally wounded shesnatched the fuse from his handand herself fired the cannon.For her brave actions she wasmade an officer in the Spanisharmy, and presented with manydecorations. Saragossa fell, butonly after 50,000 of her citizenshad perished from war and pestilence, Her heroic defense staggered Napoleon for a time, forit revealed the intrepid spiritof a people when fighting fortheir homes. Agustina lived tobe very old, dying in 1857.(Copyright, 1911. hy Joseph B, Bowles.)What makes you nervous?

He brought it to a halt so thechild would not have to walk in themuddy street and the conductor helped her up the high step, for the smalltraveler was alone. More than that,he refrained from jerking the bellropeuntil she was seated, so she was notthrown off her feet at the sudden turning on of electric power. But she wasshort of stature and was obliged tosit on the edge of the seat to let herlegs hang down, for otherwise theywould have stuck, out straight. Selecting a nickel from a tiny purse sheextracted from her white fur muff, sheextended it to the conductor when hecame along. He gave her 2 centschange."You'll soon be a young lady andpay full, fare," he said, with an attempt at gallantry.Up went a little hand, holding thetwo pennies between finger andthumb. The conductor was puzzled,until the child spoke."I don't want any change," she explained. "Mamma says I'm a younglady now, 'cause I'm 6 years old today." With an indulgent smile the conductor took the coins.

HINTON.Blue Grass Crop Heavy in Kentucky.The crop of bluegrass seed which isready to be gathered is considered thehaviest that has been raised for severalyears. Central Kentucky producespractically all of the bluegrass of theworld, and the crop of seed is one. cfthe important revenues of the CentralKentucky farmer. The annual production runs all the way from 300,000 tc800.000 bushels, and this year it i estimated may make almost 1.000. 00Q bushels. The price varies from 40 or 50cents to $1 per bushel. In view of theheavy crop the sales this year arestarting at 50 cents a bushel as itstands in the pasture, the buyer doingthe stripping. An acre of bluegrasswill produce from 15 to 30 bushels ofseed, and as the reaping of the seed inno way impairs the value ot the grassfor grazing purposes, the sale of theseed stands as a special premium paidannually to the owner of bluegrass sod.COTS FOR CONCLAVE.Place your final order- forcots and bedding not laterthan Thursday noon, May 23Roxie Davis.Don't Be AfraidEat What You Want.Eat what you want when you wantit and "Digestif."
