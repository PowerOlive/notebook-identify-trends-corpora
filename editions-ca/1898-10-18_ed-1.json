RHYME OF RHYMES
Wild on the mountain peak the wind
Repeats its old refrain
Like ghosts of mortals who have sinned
And fain would sin again
For wind I do not rhyme to mind
Like many mortal men
Again when one reflects twere kind
To rhyme as if agen
I nerer met a single soul
Who spoke of wind as wined
And yet we use it on the whole
To rhyme to find and blind
We say Now dont do that agen
When people give us pain
In poetry nine times in ten
It rhymes to Spain or Dane
Oh which is wrong or which is right
Oh which is right or wrong
Tho sound in prose familiar quite
Or those we meet in song
To hold that love can rhyme to pror
Requires some force of will
Yet in the ancient lyric groove
We meet them jhyming still
This was our learned fathers wont
In prehistoric times
We follow it or if we dont
We oft run short of rhymes
Andrew Lang in Longmans Magazine
DICKS GOOD TIME
A Very Human Boy Enjoying His Well
Earned Reward
A portly gentleman sat on the porch
and smiled while a small boy also
smiling painted the front fence
Look at that hoy the portly man
remarked to a visitor He thinks he
is having a good time A small boy is
surely the drollest creature on earth
When I was a youngster I remember
that there were certain kinds of work I
considered play and one of them was
painting I was always crazy to paint
Many times I have taken a bucket of
muddy water and an old paint brush
and have spent a whole half day put
ting a thick coat on the side of my fa
thers barn
So with my boy Dick the little
chap painting the fence He has alwayB
been crazy to paint He is enjoying
himself now you can see he is and he
will paint that whole fence too just
as well as he knows how I dont care
if it is a trifle smeared Hes getting
joy solid joy thicker than the paint
on his hands and clothes
Theres a mean side to it too He
wanted to paint the fence and I wanted
the weeds pulled out of the yard So
like an underhanded rascal I bargained
with him I told him that if he would
pull all the weeds out I would let him
paint the fence He went through the
other job like a soldier he hates to
pull weeds all boys do and now he
thinks he is getting his reward It is a
downright shame to fool him that way
dont you think so
The portly gentleman chuckled again
and the small boy wild with joy went
on plastering paint on the fence De

Crossing the Threshold
Crossing the threshold was and is
the most critical period of the wedding
day with all races not even excepting
the Anglo Saxon
The superstitious fears of the many
always particularly alert on the occa
sion of a marriage culminate in this
final act of the drama The lifting of
the bride over the threshold or her step
ping across it is the signal in Persia
Arabia and among the Copts of Egypt
for the sacrifice of a goat or a sheep
Among the Aenezes according to
Burckhardt the bridegroom simply
kills a lamb in front of his father-in-laws
tent and the ceremony but for
the running of the bride from one tent
to another is complete Perhaps the
purest symbolical act is that of the
Transylvanian Saxon bridal pair who
step over the threshold with their hands
tied together Some of these Transyl
vanian customs are remarkable and
must be survivals from a very ancient
period The bridegroom never wears
the shirt made for him by the bride ex
cept on his wedding day and at his
burial just as the veil of the Japanese
bride becomes one day her shroud

or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the -late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealtlrbf
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUSTBE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHON
THIS GLOBE ygk
The famous Hazzard circulp
capitalists in New York andtheuqU
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raisep in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money byour
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
