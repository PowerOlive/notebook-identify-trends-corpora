At ameeting held in the offices of thePeoples and Deposit Bank, representatives of the Paris CommercialClub, the Board of Health, ParisParis Woman's Club and the Councilwere present.At the regular meeting of theBoard of Council held recently themembers went on record as beingopposed to enactment of House BillNo. 32 and Senate Bill No. 39, giving additional powers to the StateBoard of Health, giving as their reason for the action that they believed the State Board already is exercising more power than is beneficial to the citizens of some communities. At the meeting held in the Bankthe true meaning of the bill was explained to the representatives of theCouncil, who immediately rescindedtheir former action. A resolutionwas drawn approving the bill andrequesting Representative Jas. H.Thompson and State Senator HenryS. Caywood to do all in their powerfor its passage. Some of the Council members declared that the matter had been put before them in awrong light, causing them to thinkthe object of the bill was to givethe State Board of Health power toregulate the water rates.The provisions of the measurewould be especially beneficial toParis, it is believed, due to the difficulties which have been experiencedhere in securing a supply of purewater. According to statements ofthe City Board of Health and Secretary William E. Hacker, of the ParisCommercial Club repeated analysesof 'the water taken in the last yearshow the supply imrfure a large partof the time. The State Board ofHealth has been asked to remedy thesituation here, but that body declined action until it had been givenauthority to demand such repairs inthe water plant as -would assure aconstant supply of pure water."ttle Know Row"MothersandFathersLook Here!To raise cash we haveplaced on sale a lot ofBoys'All WoolSuitsat$4.50A price you cannot afford to pass for a Boy'sAll Wool Suit.Be among the thriftybuyers and shop , athome We can alwaysgive you the best values.Mitchell &Blakemorer & v-z ir'gt-iffMEXAMINATIONS OF PUPILS FOECOUNTY DIPLOMASExamination of pupils for countydiplomas wa's held at the countvcourt house on 27 and 28 of January.The result of then examination isgiven below.

GradingGROWERS ARE WELL PLEASEDDelivery of tobacco to the localhouses of the Co-operative BurleyTobacco Marketing Association,which began with a flying startMonday, has continued uninterruptedly throughout the week,about fifty loads per day being received and graded on the floors ofthe houses. The farmers and growers have expressed satisfaction withthe workings of the Associationmarketing plans and the prices received for the crops has been inmost every case up to the expectations. In many instances the ad-vances received have been greaterthan the total received for theircrop last year.Everything has gone along as regularly as clock work at the localhouses with the graders, S.

It is now in the calendar,and may come to a vote this week.Advocates of the measure contended at committee hearing that thestamps impose an additional burdenof 3 per cent, a year on the cost ofdoing business, which, they said,was transferred to the consumer. The stamp companies' representatives claim that the cost wasless than 2 per cent, and said thatit was their way of giving discounts.The. bill is being, supported by theRetailers' Association of Kentucky;also, State organizations of druggists, clothiers, hardware dealersand others.For Saturday and Monday OnlyRUDDER'S NEW SHOPON SECOND STREETBrinf RUDDER your team the next time you need shoeing.

But it is easy to see that Secretary Weeks does not want him to, Ihave it.Why do the people feel thus?Well, while they look with some indulgence on Ford's economic and sociological views, and even thoughout of sympathy with some of them,they have complete confidence in twothings in him:First, .they believe him to be anhonest man' who, when he',promises,to make the Muscle Shoals projecta blessing to the nation, means it,and has the engineering basis forboth believing that he can do it andvan nieans to carry out his intentions. Second, they have seen him do engineering, manufacturing and meckanical marvels for many years,and do not believe he is talking anywild nonsense when .it comes to thegreat project of making a Balvagefor the government at MuscleShoals.Why then the seeming hesitationon the part of the secretary?When all is said and done Ford isa national problem. He has all sortsof irregular ideas and ways. He isthe great outsider in Americanbusiness generally to-day. The richest man in America, and with thepossible exception of Hugo Sinnes,the richest man in the world,' making money at the rate of perhaps aquarter of a million dollars a day,he does not play the business gameaccording to the old Wall Streetrules. By the very nature of thingssuch a power as his wealth gives himmust be used. He is showing a tendency o spread out. He is alreadyin the railway game.The fact is, his achievement is outdoing everybody else in amassingwealth, without cutting wages, whileenjoying no monopoly, and .whileasking no favors of Wall Street,makes him a creature of sinister import to the Wall Street crowd. Theywonder at him. And since he returned on them and refinanced himself at the deflation, period in thatperfectly thrilling way without bowing to Wall Street, they fear him.If he fails to get the concession atMuscle Shoals, inquire in the neighborhood of Trinity Church whereWall Street intersects with Broadway. It will be Wall Street whichwill keep him from it.If Wall Street had offered as gooda bargain to the government as Fordoffers, it would have had the contract in its pocket long ago.- .i. '.

These women know what they have suffered, theydescribe their symptoms and state howthey were finally made well. Just plainstatements, but they want other womento be helped.Lydia E.

Its growth and development have been a great boon especially rural residents, and the people in sparsely settled communitieshave come to depend upon it for obtaining a great variety of supplies,which prior to its establishmentcould only be had at great inconvenience and expense. It is now proposed, with the approval of Postmaster General Hays, to cripple ifnot to destroy this splendid universal service by depriving it of itsspecial delivery feature and restricting the use of the special delivery stamp or its equivalent tofirst-class mail matter. This, ofcourse, means the consequent enrichment of the express companyand an increased transportation taxupon the consumer.As Representative Arthur B.Rouse (Dem. Ky.) says, it is "a deliberate attempt to throttle andcripple our great parcel post service.It robs the producer, the consumer,the seller and the buyer of the splendid 'service they now have and thebill could not be more in the interest of the express companies hadthey themselves drawn it."Postmaster General Hay's supportof the bill is based upon his statement that the volume of parcel postmatter carrying special deliverystamps is so great that it is physically impossible to treat more expeditiously . than ordinary mailmatter, which statement Mr. Rousecharacterizes as "a humiliating spectacle of inefficiency on the part ofthe Postoffice Department."With the huge postal deficiencystaring him in the face, it might beassumed that Pastmaster GeneralHays would at least wish to retainthe revenues derived from this service, but still we must rememberthat there is a Republican administration and therefore the interest ofthe express companies as well asother big corporations must be considered.HOW'S THIS ?HALL'S CATARRH MEDICINE willdo what we claim for it rid your systemof Catarrh or Deafness caused by catarrh.

Making of Indian ar-'row heads has been reduced to" Itsfirst principles here by Herbert WellsPay, custodian of the Lincoln monument, who has gained the distinction,which it is said until now has beenundisputed, of being the only whiteman to make real arrow heads.Indians are among the foremost increditing Mr. Fay with this ability.Drawn 4to the last resting place ofAbraham Lincoln, various present-dayIndian chiefs have openly confessedtheir Ignorance of "just how" to makearrow heads, and then have voicedtheir surprise at the excellent workmanship of the white man.Finding that his arrows have beentaken for the work of real Indians,Mr. Fay no longer makes arrows offlint, but to prevent fraud uses onlyglass.Worked Near Dekalb.His study of arrow heads wasgained largely near his former homeat Dekalb, in which vicinity, he said,there had been seven Indian camps.Mr. Fay takes Issue with other authorities who say arrow heads maybeidentified by their shape as the workof a particular tribe. Years of studyand the actual making of arrows proveotherwise, Mr. Fay declares.His conclusions as to arrow-makingare outlined as follows: "Indians firsttried stones that break with a concholdal .fracture (like the Inside of aspoon) f They found that the deeperthe break at the top of the flat-surfacedstone the longer would be thebreak iu the stone, but it would becorrespondingly wide, They wished,however, a long, narrow piece as moresuitable for an arrow head."They then found that by breakingthe stone at a corner they could produce such a 'flake' (raw arrow head)one, two, or even five times its width,according to the skill of the artisan.Such an arrow head always has nridge on one side and the other sidesmooth. The ridge Is the corner ofthe stone from which the flake wasbroken."Next, the Indian "found that in finishing the arrow head, If the stonebreaks easier from one direction onthe top, it would break just as easilyfrom the other on the bottom. Thisgave rise to the belief that arrowheads were made to revolve. Such wasnot the intention of arrow makers, asthe 6ame natural peculiarity appearsin spear heads, which are too heavyto revolve, as spears were seldom expected to go more than a few timestheir length."These principles being true of allstone used by the Indians, it is an evident Impossibility for any collector totell what tribe made certain arrowspear heads. The width, depth andthickness, determined. by the depth olthe fracture of the stone, determinethe shape and appearance of the finished product."Chert Center in lilinois.Most of the arrow heads of thenorth Mississippi valley, Mr. Fay said,were made of chert, a chalky flint,taken from the quarries in Unioncounty, Illinois, near Cairo. The bluffsat that place along the Mississippiriver, show outcroppings of this chertand prolific evidences of the activityof Indians, who went there from allparts of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa andWisconsin, he added."Less than 1 per cent of the arrowheads. found in this wide territory,"Mr. Fay continued, "seem to have beenmade from local stone. The Unioncounty quarries have been determinedas the principal source because arrowsfound throughout that region corresponded exactly to the quality of theUnion county stone. It is not knownwhether expert flake1 makers heldthe quarries in Union county and distributed material to tribes as theycame down, or whether each tribe hadits flake makers and visited the quarries periodically.Implements used by Indians in making arrow heads, according to Mr. Fay,were made with one tool, a piece ofbone somewhat like the handle of atoothbrush.GAINS 25 POUNDSTAKte TANLAC"I Don't Hesitate To Becommemd ItTo Anyone Suffering From Stomach Trouble And Kindred Complaints," States Well Known Seattle Woman."After hearing so much aboutTanlac I bought a bottle thinking ifit did others so much good it mighthelp me, too.
