DLY
This fearful disease often first appears
as a mere scratch a pimple or lump in
the breast too small to attract any
notice until in many cases the deadly
disease is fully developed
Cancer can not be cured by a surgical
one ration because the disease is a virulent
poison in the blood circulating throughout the system and although
the sore or ulcer known as the Cancer may be cut away the
poison remains in the blood and promptly breaks out afresh with
renewed violence
The wonderful success of S S S in curing obstinate deep seated
blood diseases which were considered incurable induced a few de
spairing sufferers to try it for Cancer after exhausting the skill of
the physicians without a cure Much to their delight 8 S S proved
equal to the disease and promptly effected a cure The glaa news
rapidly and it was soon demonstrated
beyond doubt that a cure had at last been
found for deadly Cancer Evidence has accu
mulated which is incontrovertible of which
the following is a specimen
Cancer is hereditary in our family my father a
sister and an aunt having died from this dreadful
disease My feelings may be imagined when the hor
rible disease made its appearance on my side It was
-A malignant Cancer eating inwardly in such a way as
to cause great alarm The disease seemed beyond the
skill of the doctors for their treatment did no good
whatever the Cancer growing worse all the while
Numerous remedies were used for it but the Cancer
MRS S M IDOL
grew steadilv worse until it seemed that I was doomed
to follow the others of the familv for I know how deadly Cancer is especially
when inherited I was advised totrv Swifts Specific S S S which from the
first day forced out the poison I continued its use until I had taken eighteen
bottles when I was cured sound and well and have had no symptoms of the
dreadful affliction though many years have elapsed S S S is the ovij cure
for Cancer Mrs S M Idol Winston N C z
