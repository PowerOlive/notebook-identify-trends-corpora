prevent them from doing soby keeping them on the defensive during the hours of daylightThe enemy fired a few shots on ourleft Sunday night but did no damageTheir splendid successes throughoutlast week have not caused the Americans to relax their vigilance in theleast On the contrary our troops areeven more alert than ever if that werepossibleManila Feb 14 The 20th Kansasand the 1st Idaho volunteers

intelligence of the fall of thecity came in a cable dispatch fromMaj Gen Otis which Adjt Gen Corbinpromptly authorized to be made publicThere is a feeling of intense satisfaction among such of the administrationofficials as are aware of this battle asconsiderable apprehension has existednet however as to the ability of theAmericans to take the place vhen theydecided upon this step but as tothe loss of life which this mightincur The tension between the opposing forces at Iloilo has been forsome time at the danger point and acollision between them at any timewould not have been surprising Itis felt here that Gen Millerhas conducted himself with greatcircumspection in treating with thenatives as their attitude has been any- supplied with rations Meanwhile thething- but conciliatory and petty an committees for the relief of the poornoyances have been resorted to bythem to provoke the AmericansWashington Feb 10 The confirmation of the press reports detailingthe capture of Iloilo were received atthe war department Tuesday with considerable satisfaction While no apprehension had been felt as to GenMillers ability to capture the capitalof the Visayan federation or for thatmatter anything- else that was wantedin the archipelago the reportsof strong intrenchments that thenatives had been constructing aroundthe town led the department to fearTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY FEBRUARY 17 1899that the landing would be a bloodieraffair than either of the battles of Manila It was with great satisfactiontherefore that Adm Deweys dispatchwas received saying that we had lostno men at all and that the casualtiesamong the natives were much smallerthan at first reportedThe fact that foreign interests inIloilo are being satisfactorily guardtdis another source of gratification to theadministration This forestalls criticism or danger of interferencefrom any foreign power whichhas all along been a complication thathad to be considered as a possibilitybut which it was intended to avoid atall costsLondon Feb 15 A dispatch received at Lloyds Tuesday from Manilareports that there was serious fightingat Iloilo on Saturday February 11and that much property was destroyedThe

It waslearned that the rebels were assembling there and our troops were dispatched to make a reconnoissanceIt was not expected that any seriousresistance would be made by the insurgents but thev made

injury is slight The insurgents held their position for anhour but the Americans made thingsso lively for them that they were compelled to withdrawThe steamer Butuan which leftIloilo on Monday brought

generallyunderstood that Arthur Rielow apainter of some reputation butchurch mouse was in loveas poor as awith her and that she thought a lot ofhimAh muttered the detective hiseyes gleaming she liked the poor manbestIt is said went on Dr Lumpkinthat her lawyers informed her of thecondition in the will more promptlythan they intended because her preference for Gielow was becoming noticeable In fact many believe she was onthe point of becoming his wifeThe lines of Hendricks brows ran to-gvther as if his beard at which he wasfmrrine were a bunch of puckeringstringsAnd in case rf the death ofers he questionedThe will seemed to be equally explicit on that point replied Dr Lampkin The fortune was to be turnedover to Miss Huntington at the end oftwo years if she was the wife ofCaruthers In the

up the rearstairs They know the number of theapartment and theyll get there in timeto report the whole bloodj business inthe morning Jcewhilikins wont thepublic have a royal feastThe two men managed to reach theoffice unobserved Little groups ofidlers were gathered here and therelike eddies in the current of humanitythat swirled through the great roomi Every now and then some one wouldthrow- a horrified glance up at the mainstairs as if expecting the reappearanceof the policemenHendricks was glad he was knownby sight to only a few people for itoften enabled him to act with morefreedom than

with her auntMrs Winfret on the divan under thepalmsThank you said Hendricks and toLampkins surprise for he had considered his friend mortally averse to meeting ladies the detective gracefullyavoiding whisking skirts and flyingheels made his way to where the twoladies were sittingI beg your pardon he began addressing the younger of the two an exceedingly beautiful sr young woman 1trust you will pardon my boldness butit is important that I should speak toa mattered by your own servants you haveroom Which they occupied alone when minutesihe servants in the adjoining lunchroom heard their loud voices and wentin just as Caruthers was slapping Gielow in the face and calling him a presumptuous pauper Gielow hurled a bottle at the head of his antagonist butby ducking Caruthers preserved

long and that I mightperhaps see you thereMrs Winfret colored slightlyI have no doubt that your requestwill prpve to be reasonable in everyway but our escorts have just left theroom for a few minutes and andyour proposal is unusual to say theleastHendricks cast a furtive glance atthe office Small groups had melted1into lanre ones and quite a crowd hadgathered round the counter It WUplain to Dim

police in fact as it will thepublic at large that he is the one manin existence who would be likely to wantCaruthers to send in his checks as itwere especially as they had a row justprior to the committal of the deedIt certainly does look shaky forGielow admitted LampkinMy one hope said Hendricks isthat Gielow does not needle point hisfinger nails Few artists have time forsuch feminine

acquaintance with the goodnatured servant Fanny Barnes wasdue to our meeting at the post officeiu the village where we w ere takingand receiving letters for the respectiveschoolsOne cloudy dav in September my fahcr came to visit me at Dr StagmirevSHe was called by business to Californiaand was to be away for three motvtbslie asked for a half holiday which wagladly granted for Dr Stagmire wasseldom averse to allowing this iittie indulgence to himself and his pupilsWhen he was going away my fatherplaced t coin in my handDick my boy he said there is aten dollar gold piece Dont be extravagant with it for I am not rich butdont be stingyI was not stingy The very next afternoon Dr Stagmire kindly consenting and even aeeompanx iug lie procession 1 went followed by all my schoolmates two abreast to the only refreshment saloon in the village where wewere furnished ad libitum with sandwiches and ice cream while the noninvited village boys scuffled with eachother or the best places outside thewindow to watch the feastI was a proud boy indeed when DrStagmire condescended to eat two sandwiches and a plate of ice cream at myexpense and yet a prouder one whenwith day respected principal beside me1 again beaded the long line of boys andmarched to the counter where somcwhat ostentatiously 1 fear I threwdown my coin Then the fact was developed that the ten dollar gold piecewas a bad oneThe procession on its way back tothe school was perhaps a little disorganized 1 as heretofore was in advance with Dr Stagmire beside mewhile my schoolmates lollowed boiling over with ver indifferently -suppressedcontemptThe aood doe tot had willinjrlv radmy bill and as we walked home hi assured me that he had no doubt therewas a mistake somewhere whichsooner or later would be explainedThe boys 1 was sorry to find took adifferent view of the situation and TomCan oil who waa said to have the powerof standing longer on one foot than anyOther of the pupils remarkedIf lJanchards father gave him a badten dollar piece then Mr Blanchardmust be a very queer kind of u manThat is all I have to sayTom did himself an injustice Thatwtes not quite all he had to say Thenext day he said more It was in effectthat if joung Blanchard had not received the coin from his father but hadsimply tried to pass off a spurious pieecobtained elsewhere with this paltrytale he was a very queer kind of a boy1 suppose there are many boys whowould have resented these remarks ofTom Carroll I did not do so I was notquarrelsome and 1 liked Tom i wassure that some mistake existed thatwould be explained eventually AndIn icies Tom was half a foot taller thanI and m chances of satisfying him byphysical force that he was wrong wouldhave been of a very slender kind Sothe days passed by and I

BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY FEBRUARY 17 1899before and again I ran fauny harnesand told her about my troubleI dont believe it she said emphatically I never saw your fatherbut I am sure he cannot be a robberHe never gave you the coinMy father was certainly not a robber But that he had given me thecoin and advised me to be neither extravagant nor stingy with it did notadmit of a doubt 1 said soThen said Fanny after a momentsintense thought he did not know thatit was a bad oneNow surely there would have beenno suggestion more reasonable thanthis but 1 had offered it so often andso vainly to the boys that 1 felt no desire to advance it again Then mykindly adviser made a second proposalWhy dont you write to your fatherand tell him of itBut I had determined to write neitherto my father in California nor to mymother in New York relative to thebad coin I thought that to do so wouldbe an insultThen I am sure 1 dont know whatyou can do said the vounjr womancomprehensively Vou cant go

word but feeling as if all the bl iod in my body hadsuddenly flown to ray face I drew fromu y vest pocket the wretched coin thatI had carried about with me since thekeeper of the refreshment saloon hadhanded it back to meFather it is a bail one I saidA bad one he repeated looking atit Why of course it is Easy to seethat Where in the world did you getit fromYou gave it to meI gaveit to yoii he

he turned to the boyswho had been eagerly listening and 1think as he spoke to them as well as tome thai he surmised something of thesituationThe day that I came down here tcue Dick he said a man to whom Ihad lent 10 gave uie this coin in payment 1 put it into my pocket withoutexamining it and while I was in theL jWITH DR STAYMIRE BESIDE MEtrain I remembered that I had with meanother coin of the same denominationthat 1 had reserved for Dick I lookedat them both intending to select thebrightest for him and then I saw thatthis was a bad one I put it away proposing to return it to my not too scrupulous debtor the next day How 1came to make the mistake of givingDick the bad one I declare 1 do notknow but what I do know is that 1handed the good one to that fellow inNYw York with some remark about notbeing a dealer in counterfeit monevI got nothing in exchange for he saidthe coin he had given me was all hehadOf course Dr Stagmire was willingto grant us a half holiday and oncemore without

Places to Which TheyAre AttacheolThe most of our Indian names of rivers lakes mountains etc have becomeso altered and disguised by the Englishspelling of them that it is very difficult to recover their original fcrmsand to be quite sure of the meaningthat was attached to them by the Indians In all of those cases in whichtheir significance can be clearly madeout they are found to be simply descriptive words as indeed all nameswere originally the object beingnamedfrom some notable feature of it andwe are perfectly safe as a rule in rejecting as fanciful all of those poeticalmeanings which have been attached tomany of our Indian names For example the name of Winnipiseogee hasbeen said to mean Smile of the GreatSpirit Yet this is one of the easiestnames to decipher It is pure Algonquin and meanssimply Beautiful-lake-place Winnipeg lias the same meaning At thebeautiful lake Winnepegoes is a diminutive of this name and means Little WinnipegThis word miche great enters intoseveral other Indian names Missi ouriis the Great Muddy1 Michigan is theGreat Sea nowshortened into Mackinac or Mackinawis the Great Turtle a name givento the island probably because of

which theboats were lowered and it is no exagegration to assert that if these boatswere in readiness for instant use andcould be lowered into the water easilyhundreds of lives would be saved Anyone who has made a coasting trip orerossed the channel on an ordinarystcara vessel must have noted how theboats are disposed carefully coveredwith tarpaulin kept inboard and withthe appearance of not having beentouched for months It is easy toimagine how the only means of escapefrom a sinking vessel is vitiated by thisstate of nnpreparedness To quote twoinstances there is first the wreck ofthe Drummond Castle the inquiry intowhich elicited the information thatthe boats were not kept fit and readyfor use but swung inboard and restingon chocks and second there is themore recent case of the Mohegan inwhich the same lamentable state ofaffairs seems to have obtained We holdthat on every ship there should notonly be a boat drill at least once aweek but that the boats should bekept supplied

to but ever a blot upon American womanhood I make this emphaticstatement from a personal knowledgeof the homes which these women leavebehind when they go to their meetings writes Edward Eok in The Ladies Home JournalI have seen the roorr of theirhomes left in wild disorder I have seentheir servants sitting in idleness withwork on every hand to do I have seenthe children neglected and left to theirown devices I have heard husbandsspeak in derision of the motives of theirwives No woman in a happy Americanhome can ever afford to Uceu to theseparasites of her sexFortunately the platform womansinfluence is steadily on th wane Shewas never a power She was never evenpicturesque Her worst injury waswrought upon certain weak women whofor the time she deluded But evenwith them she was soon regarded withwonder rather than with interest withsuspicion rather than with confidenceThe disappearance of the platform woman is a case of a blot being blottedoutSuccessive Steps In SuccessThe
