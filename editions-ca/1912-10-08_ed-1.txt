There reallvshould not be anything in this country such; as a worn out farm. Intelligent farming means that the farmersis better this year than last and shouldbe better next than this.

After-absorption the blood carries the foodthrough the body, and each cell takes from the blood the food it needs. A pureglyceric extract made from bloodroot, mandrake, stone, queen's root and goldenseal and sold by druggists for the past forty years untbr the name of Dr. Pierce'sGolden Medical Discovery, gives uniformly excellent results as a tonic to helpin the assimilation of the food and in the absorption by the blood of the foodit requires. Eradicate the poisons from the blood with this alterative extractwhich docs not shrink the white blood corpuscles, because containing no alcohol crother injurious ingredients, xaus the body can be budtup strong to resist disease.

LEER STOUT,4 3t Seventh street.machineforKentucky's Situation.-The vote in Kentucky in the Presidential election isimerely a matter ofmajority, as no sane man questionsthe fact of Wilson and Marshall carrying the State. Under normal conditions there 'are 280.000 Democraticvotes in the State and 228.000 Republican votes. There is a probability, owing to the fact that the race is onesided, that theDemcorats will not pollover 225,000. but the Republicans willpoll much less a per cent of their vote.There is great disgust among the Republicans, and there will be the largeststay-at-home vote among them inmany years. We think that the maximum vote polled by the Taft andRoosevelt ticKets will not exceed 200,000. It is more likely to be less thanj this. It is not likely that there willoe any .Democrats who will vote thetfuIJ Moose ticket, but for every Democratic vote not lost in this way themwill be a dozen Republicans who willvote for Wilson.The question is how will the Republican vote be divided between Taft andRoosevelt. Recently we had opportunity to get a full and fair expressionfrom every Congressional district in jthe State. In the Third, Ninth and!Tenth Districts Taft will get more Ivotes than Roosevelt. In the Second,Seventh and Eighth District ther,e willbe a practically stand-off between thetwo. In the other Districts Rooseveltwill lead Taft coonsiderably, especiallyin the Eleventh. It looks now likeRoosevelt will get 110,000 votes andTaft 90,000. If these figures are borneout and there is no material changebetween now and election, Wilson willhave a plurality over Roosevelt of115.000 and a majority over both of25,000.Varieties of Feed for Horses.Figs are fed to horses in Turkey,dates are given them In Arabia andcurrants in Egypt.Rare Brotherly Affection.In willing the residue of his estateto his brother, the late R.

He is beginning to understand whether it is notabout time to call a halt on the Republican practice of taxing the coat offhis back and threatening him with theloss of his shirt and his socks if hedoes not submit.All through the present tariff law,passed by a Republican congress andindorsed by a Republican president asTHE BEST TARIFF BILL EVERPASSED, are to be found discriminations, the higher duty oh the cheaperarticle, the lower duty on the dearerarticle, thus placing on the shouldersof those least able to bear it the greater burden of the protective system.Ileie are some illustrations:The cheapest wool blankets bear aduty of 105.12 per cent; the dearest,104.G5 per cent.Flannels, not more than 40 cents apound, are taxed at 143.G7 per cent;oer 70 cents a pound, 7G 37 per centWool plushes, cheapest, 141.73 percent; dearest, 05 33 per cent.Knit fabiics, cheapest. 141 percent;dearest, 05.53 per centStockings, worth fiom $1 to $1.30 adoen. 70 37 per cent; from $2 to $3,50 por centElats and bonnets, worth not over .$5a dozen, 02 per cent; over .$20 a dozen,35 per centCarpets, highest pi iced, 50 per cent;that used for mats and rugs, 12G SS percentWomen's gloves, unlined, 40 per cent;lined. 34 per cent; longest gloves, unlined. 42 per cent; lined. 20 per cent.Men's gloves, worth less than $3 adozen. 0G 2S per cent; cdstliest gloves,14.45 per cent; leather, unlined, 44.5Sper cent; lined, 20.30 per centBuckles, cheapest, 77.48 per cent;dearest, 2G 33 per cent.Uncut diamonds bear a 10 per centduty; imitatiou diamonds, 20 per centThe humble firecracker bears a97.02 per cent duty, while elaboratefireworks bear but 70 per centMatting, smaller and cheaper grades,43 per cent; costlier, 24 per centWatch movements, seven jewels,6G02 per cent; 11 jewels, 40.41 percent; 17 jewels, 34.43 per centUnderwear, cheapest. 5G.90 per cent;deatest, 30 per cent.Dress goods of wool, cheapest105.42 per cent; dearest, 94.13 per centVelvets, cheapest 105.22 per cent;dearest, 40 55 per centSilk handkerchiefs, cheapest, 77.44per cent; dearest, 50 per centScissors, worth 50 cents a dozen,52 21 per cent; worth $1.75 a dozen, 4Gpor centTable knives, fincy grades, 57.40 percent; bone handled, G9.43 per centDutcher knives, best grades, 52.10 perrent; cheapest grades, 93.55 per cent.Filos, smallest, Sl.20 per cent, longest. 3G SI per centShotguns, worth from $3 to $10, 47.G7por cent; worth over $10, 45.4G percent.These are only a part of the discriminations, gleaned from a swiftconning of some of the schedules.

Evidently they hadworked upon the Dlan of escape at regular intervals and the cutting aroundthe stone occupied three or four davs.Their efforts no doubt would havebeen crownedjwith successhad not Jailer Farris detected a bed quilt hangingon the wall where. the men had been atwork and on investigation found thestone was almost ready tc.fall from itsposition.The opening in the wall would havegiven the men access to the jail yardand their escape could have been completed in only a short time.
