battlingbravely along against the drivingsnow and the fierce north windThe morning train that day hadbrought a stranger to this quiet townHe was rather a grim looking personage and was apparently in a verybad humor It had been clear when heleft the city in the early morningand lie found himself landed urnbrellaless in a driving storm when hereached Hillsboro That had annoyed hini and his first thought wasto take a train right back to townBut when on inquiry he found thatthere would be no return train untilthe one he liad originally intended totake late in the afternoon he decided to go on and get his- disagreeable business over with and done withThen he had found that there wasno conveyance to be had at that forsaken station and no telephone connection with any stable and that therewas nothing fcr him to do but to pushforward on foot through the stormwhich he finally did in an ever-increasingill humorHe had but a mile to go the manat the station had told him and theroad was straight so he could normiss the small white cottage just thisside of ihe covered wooden bridgeBut the road had seemed to stretchout and the snow andfreezing street combined to makewalking more difficult at every stepSo there was not often a man in aworse humor than this man was whenthe low white cottage he was seekingat last came into sight And now ashe suddenly hastened his footsteps hesomehow slipped and fell heavilystriking his head and doubling his lefxarm under him But he made no murmur at this misadventure but lay stilland quite unconscious on the groundWhen he again opened his eyes hewas on the bed in a small neat roombut all that he thought of at first wasthat his head was paining him terribly while his arm was hurting himeven more Some one whom he couldnot see was fussing with his head andmaking the pain still worse ne feltso desperately cross and ill that heimpatiently ordered the unseen meddler to leave him and his head aloneI beg your pardon said a pleasant voice but its a bad cut and itshould be dressed at once Im perfectly competent to do it but youriarm -will have to wait until the doctorcomesWhats the matter with my confounded arm He tried to move itand groaned outright with the painIts broken Im afraid but the doctor will be here to set it soonThen the hapless stranger fell torating the place the storm and hisaccident so soundly that anothervoice from another as yet unseen individual spoke up in sharp rebukeArent you ashamed of yourself totalk so when were- doing our best tohelp ycuOh hush Susan broke in thepleasant voice Hes suffering dreadfully he really dont know what hessayingYes I do said the stranger gruffly an3 I beg your pardon but youveI been hurting me like the deuceAh heres the doctor said thepleasant voice in a tone of relief Andthen the stranger found himself transferred into the skillful hands of theprofessional whose treatment of hiswounds was much more rigorous thanI that of the deft and gentle fingers hehad railed against but novWhen at last his head had been bandaged and his arm had been set thephysician gave some brief instructionsto his new patient He would have toremain where he was for several daysand must keep very quiet on accountof the wound in his headBut I must return to town to daythe stranger said peremptorily Ihave en engagement fjy to morrowand thanksgiving dingers are not tobe put oftAll right go said the

Against aBank in Favor of an IndividualEvery person who is even tolerablywell informed knows the difference between the assessment of a bank and thatof an individual for taxationBanks are required to make swornstatements of their condition four timesa year These statements set out tunyevery item of assets the bank claims tohave Not so much as even one pennyis omitted and the statement shows notthe fair cash value of the banks assetsbut the value at which it is carried onthe books of the bank and if the bankhas any bad or questionable paper onits books this paper is shown in its statement at face value The banks are expected to pay tax on their assets asshown by those statementsAs to how the individual gives in hisproperty for taxation every individualknows The News doubts whetherthere are five persons in the city of Pariswho have as much as five thousandylar8 worth of taxable property who givein more than 50 per cent of it for taxation It is certain that a great many donot give in as much as fifty per cent Inaddition to this the Council appoints aBoard of Equalization who equalizewhat property iB given in on a basis of 70per cent of its fair cash valueYet when the banks oeject to payingtax on statements which show their as-sets far in excess of their actual cashvalue for the cash value of a banks as-eeste is what could be realized on themin event of liquidation people who donot know or who do not think say theyare objecting to paying tax like otherpeopleA Council ought to be composed ofbusiness men and certainly business menknow that instead of objecting to pay-ing tax

Arethey not decisions of tne uame courtIf the banks pay under the present decision would they not be protected indoing so V Unquestionably Theu howcan the Council claim that they are notprotected by paying while the first decision was in force as required by thatdecision If they should pay underthe last decision and in eight or J tenyears the Court should again reverseitself would any one think it right thatthey should lose all the money they hadpaid in the meantime in complyingwith the requirements of the presentdecision To claim that the banks arenot protected by complying with the requirements of the first decision of theCourt of Appeals on this subject andpaying tax as required by that decisionwould if upheld by the courts renderifc impossible for any one ever to knowwhat his rights are To an ordinaryman unacquainted with legal sinuosities the law whenever it hasterpreted by the highest Court is whatever that interpretation makes it andthe citizen has a right to accept that interpretation as his guide and rule ofconduct and be governed by it in thedischarge of his duties whether it be theduty of paying tax or any other dutyand if the courts will not protect him inthis then his rights are without legaldefinition and there is an end o all business enterpriseThe banks paid all the tax due fromthem for 1893 and 94 under a decision ofthe highest court Does anyone believethat if they were individuals and notbanks the question of taxation for thoseyears would have been raised againstthem Certainly notNotwithstanding the claim has beenmade that the Henderson banks weresued for taxes for 93 and 94 and judgment was given against them and theyhad so little hope of reversing the judgment that they paid up dollar lor dollarwithout ever taking an appeal and thefact is that no bank in Kentucky haspaid any back tax except on a compromise and in nearly every case the compromises ha been much more favorable to the banks than that offered bythe Paris banks and rejected by theCouncil Iu tiad of the Hendersonbanks paying dollar for dollar of the taxclaimed by t e city of Heuderson for1893 ana 1894 under judgment of thecourt the fact is that the case nevercame to trial at all but was compromised out of court and an agreed judgment rendered under which the bankspaid about 50 per cent of the tax claimed by the city So far from the Council having uo rigat to compromise thecourt iin the Henderson case acceptedthe compromise as the basis of thejndgment rendered All other CityCouncils have the right to compromise except the Paris CouncilWe are the

circulation ofthe blood to which one is first sensitive through a feeling of chillSo slight is the chill oftentimes thatnot until thepreliminary sneeze comesis the victim aware that he or she hasbeen in the 1 rack of a draught or thatthe temperature has changed- The usual notion is that by going indoors changing to heavier clothing orretreating from the moist atmospherethe danger is averted These precautions are ail well enough but the firstahd most efficacious measures shouldbe to restore the quick flow of warmblood through every vein and so bybeat instantly counteract the littlechillOne perhaps the simplest method ofdoing this has been learned by menwho stand on sentinel duty who areobliged to suffer more or Jess exposurein winter or who scorn the comfortsin cold weather of overcoat and umbrellaTheir method when the temperatureof the body ov extremities is lower ora sudden chill or quick change fromwarm to cold atmosphere is enduredis to inhale three or four deep breathsexpand the luugs to their fullest extent holding every time the inhaled airas long as possible and then slowly letting it forth ihrough the nostrilsin doing this the inflation of thelungs sets the heart into such quick motion that the blood is driven with unnsua force along its channels and soruns out into the tiniest veinsThis radiates a glow down to thetoes and finger tips and sets up a quickreaction against the chill The wholeqffect is to stir the Uood and set it inmotion as from rpid exerciseLet any woman who goes to a dinner or ball in a low necked dress wherthe rooms are chilly ahd her wraps arenot accessible try this little cure orr still fhis preventive ag iiust coldand enjoy its meritsLet her Uy it when taking a colddrive or when condemned by accidentto sit in wet gnment Let the maximof a victim to colds be always Keepthe blood in rapid action use- jljejd breaths when a firrt chill is feltPearsonvs Weekly- 11 J rHOirt TJi3if Saijlveoji fo thu nglit and you miverg elleft la

the price of her silence McLane honestly told Fan thetruth and was astonished at her decision She bade him pay the moneyand have done with itThey might have doubtedthe genuineness of her letter but there was nodoubting that of young McLanes dyingslatemcnt witnessed by the officersfrom Sedgwick He declared his mother alive And so one crime led to another No sooner had ther reachedCalifornia than the whole Perkins1family seemed resurrected and blackmail was their business The eldestsister demanded heavy hush moneyand it was paid TTie second sisterturned up with herhnsband and a pre-is

her son theyat least knew nothing of the lattersdeath and then Fanny coming to Sedgwick tried to reassert her old sovereignty over Merriam and to gain possession of the papers of which her husband had told her and which Bandy hadlong since sent to Parry but concerning which she had never spoken to herbrother-in-law believing him to be ignorant of their existence and itpleased Ned Parry to let her live on inignorance that he had them He tooka curious interest in making a study ofher and had without consulting hisclient a more than professional interest in the caseBut now BullockMcLane had beenrested in Chicagodashing helpmeetthe man who shottraced to andtogether with hisUncle Mellen hadbeen prostrated by paralysis as a result of the news The secret could beno longer kept and Fanny McLnnehunted desperate self deluded andself -drugged believed herself a ruinedwoman when at last Ned Parry cameToo il to see him she seemed atleast relieved to know he had come andthat night in Graftons parlor he satravel v listening to Harriets recital ofwhat Fanny had detailed to her making no comment but taking it all inwhen just at tattoo a trooper dismounted at the gate and bore to MrsGrafton a brief missive from herband Itnearly 20was written that morningmiles northwest of JosesranchYou must prepare Merriam for theworst it said There is reason to believe poor Florence has fallen into thehands of a little band of Apaches Thesign is unmistakable and we are juststarting in pursuitCHAPTER XVILate that anxious night one battalionof the rifiers returned to SedgwickHaynes company one of the four andvery grave he looked when told of theevents of the past 4S hours Acting onthe report of Capt Grafton that Apachesigns had been found in the foothillsnorth of Joses Buxton had ordered another troop to march to reenforce himand this troop Ilayne obtained permission to accompany It marched atdawn so he had barely three hours inwhich to prepare Mr Parry weariedwith his journeying and many careshad been escorted to Merriams vacatedquarters by Whit taker some little timebefore midnight and there he wasmade welcome by Hop Ling and giventhe room abandoned by the master ofthe house so short a time before Manypeople between anxietj as to the fateof their beloved Florence and theireagerness to receive the riilers on theirreturn sat up until two oclock butParry though filled with anxiety askeen was well aware that nothing wasto be gained by his spending a wakefulnight and listening to all manner of theory as to the cause of the f air fugitivessudden deflection from the road to theranch Hayne therefore did not meetnor see him but as soon as it Was lightrode forth ahead of the troop meaningto go first to Joses see his wife and DrGould and then strike out northwardconfident of meeting the second troopsomewhere in the orjen country thatthere spread for miles before himBuxton had sent a party on the trailof Merriam within an hour of his dashand with orders to bring him back tothe post but they had not been heardfrom since their start and said Whit-taker theyre not likely to be Thosefellows barely ride one mile to Bandystwo Its my belief he will just pull upat Joses and then go straight on to thefoothills as probably she didBut Bandy was having a ride the likeof which was not recorded in the annalsof Fort Sedgwick since the dajs whenlong before the war the First Dragoonsand the Navajos battled for the mastership of the Santa Clara Ignorant asyet of the report of Apaches in thefoothills of the Mescalero his one theory was that she had gone to Josesintending from there to push on to thecantonment The thought of her daring so long and so hard a ride at a timewhen she should be guarded with theutmost care was in itself a source ofdire distress to him and he could hardly have speeded faster and with grimmer determination to defy all pain orweariness had he dreamed of the deadly perils that lurked about her pathOf the fact that Valdezand his few followers had eventually fled northwardand across the road to the Catamounthe had heard nothing Through HopLings chatter he had gathered thatGrafton and his men were gone insearch of Florence and that Mrs Hayneand Dr Gould were at Joses He darenot stop to make inquiries at the garrison He was under medical caretherefore under doctors orders andon complaint of theacting surit would begeon perfectly competent for Buxton to place himin close ftrrest His one idea there-lore was to putastjmuch groundas possible between the post and himself He know he could get anotherhorse at Joses so Brown Dick wasnever spared an instant At threeoclock galloping free the gallanthorse was st72tehsii2 away northwestward over the low rolling earth wavtsthat seemed to spread to the very lapof the Mescalero spanning the horizontoward the setting sun Far behindhim the scattered ranches and thesparse green foliage of the Santa ClaraFar away on either hand the lumpysandy barren dotted everywhere withlittle dull hucd tufts of coarse herbageor stunted sage Ahead of him the tortuous twisting dusty trail dentedwith scores of hoof prints the tracks ofGraftons troop on its way to the rescue By this time Bandy was burningwith thirst but thewater in his canteen was warm and nauseating Heraised the felt covered flask to his lipsfrom time to time and rinsed his mouthand moistened his parching throat butthat did not allay the craving He hadstill 30 miles to go before he could reachJcses and exchange Brown Dick for abroncho and have Dr Gould renew thedressing of his wounded arm Heknew that Florence had failed to appearthere but he knew her pluck and spirit and believed he knew the reasonthat there might be sojourners thereeither from the Catamount or from thepost who would seek to turn her backor hold her there and he knew that inher overwrought half maddened stateshe was starving for her mothers petting and her fathers arms He knewher so well that any attempt to dissuadeher now would result he felt assuredonly in frantic outburst and more determined effort to push aheadThen he had another and even betterreason for thinking he could quicklyfind Mignons trail although it mightbe

withfoam but still pressed gamely on andBandy with white set face in whichdeep lines of pain and weariness weregraving gazed fixedly ahead with burning fevered eyes conscious thatstrength was failing
