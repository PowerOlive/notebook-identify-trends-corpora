TARIFF "PANACEA" AGAIN
The United States Senate has
spawned its tariff bill. It is in some
respects higher than the notorious
Payne-Aldrich law of the previous
Republican administration and con
siderably above the present Under
wood law. ' i
Doubtless it represents the views
of the high protectionists of the
country who believe that a tariff
wall begets prosperity, even though
it does strangle international trade.
And it does beget prosperity for
those who are protected. But no
tariff protects everybody and this
one will come farther short of ev
erybody than any such measure for
a long period of -years.'
FOr the consumer there is one im
portant thing always to remember
about any tariff. It is that it is a
means of making the consumer pay
more for his shoes, his woolen socks
and his' clothing than otherwise.
.That is the point of a tariff to cut
out competition so that the Ameri
can manufacturer can raise his
price. Such a manufacturer, is
"protected" to be sure a benefici
ary of special privilege.
The answer of the high tariff- man
is that" the American workinglnan
gets higher wages because - of a the
"tariff. Tie American workingman
