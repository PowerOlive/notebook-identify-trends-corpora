embarrass theUnited States in the Philippine islandsand has given a signal manifestationof its desire to promote the most cordial relations between Germany andthe United States by ordering thewithdrawal of all vessels of its navyfrom Philippine waters and placingthe lives and property of itssubjects there under the protection of the United Statesgovernment The action taken is regarded here as a master stroke in diplomacy by which will be removedall possibility of a clash between German and American interests in andabout Manila and notice to all theworld and especially to any

has ordered its ships awayfrom Manila probably to their newnaval station at Kiachau on the Chinese coast The announcement wascoupled with tbe statement that theGerman vessels were needed thereThe German government followed itsannouncement to the state departmentof a purpose to order its vessels awayfrom the Philippines with a formal application to the United States government to undertake the protection of allthe Germans in the Philippines notonly in person but in property Thiswas regarded as a signal manifestationof confidence that the administrationfelt could not be resisted and as practically formal notice thatthe Germans have no ulterior purpose in the Philippines andrather than be subjected to suspicionon that score had taken the course ofturning over the care of the welfare oftheir citizens to the United States government The president very promptly accepted tht trust and there will beno German sjhips at either Manila orIloilo to disturb the relations betweenthe two

Crisis Is Believed toBe Imminent in Island of JamaicaThe Colony is Bankrupt and it is Saidthreat Britain Wants to Control theFinances That Wculd Involvea Change of ComttitutionKingston Jamaica March 1 Thiscolony is on the verge of a politicalcrisis which may involve bloodshedOwing to the treatment of the colonyby the imperial government in recentyears particularly in the matter ofmarketing its products Jamaica incommon with the other British possessions in the West Indies is virtuallybankruptUnable to meet its growing liabilities the colony necessarily looks toGreat Britain for financial aid and thecolonial office through Mr Chamberlain has answered as it has to Barbadoes and the smaller inlands that aidcan be extended soliy on conditionthat the imperial government shallcontrol the Jamaica finances hereafterThat would involve a change of theconstitution the resignation of representative institutions and the acceptance of crown colony government ThisJamaica is not prepared to concedepreferring to meet its financial crisisin some other way The other way isby a drastic scheme of retrenchmentin the too expensive administrative establishments The revenue is not somuch depleted that the country wouldnot hold its own through the crisis ifthe intolerable burden of over administration were modifiedAs under the present constitutionthe elective side of the legislature controls the finances provided a majorityof nine of the 14 representatives votesolidly for or against any financialmeasure the government has realizedthat at the coming session this policyof retrenchment would be forced uponit To meet this it has taken timelyaction It has begun a system of retrenchment that completely set thecountry by the earsIn the first place the salaries of allpetty officials including office messengers government building employesand court house cleaners have been reduced 20 per cent effecting a savingin amounts ranging from 10 to 40 ayearRecently nearly half of the statepaid district medical officers who areattached to the civil service becausethey can not by practice make a livingin the country districts have beensummarily discharged without noticeamong them some who have occupied posts for more than 40 years Be--sidesthis orders have been issued tuclose down several of the district public hospitals in some of the most important parts of the islandThe other day the governor issuedthe warrants convening council forMarch 14 and at the same time he letit be understood that his intention isto avail himself of his constitutionalprerogative to increase the official sideof the house so as to give the government a clear majority One electiveseat is vacant the occupant of anotheris out of the island and a third seat ianot to be occupied at this sessionThus the government is preparedto force the country under a pretense of constitutionalism to acceptthe contemplated change of constitution But it is not without the gravestsignificance that a general mobilization of the entire military forces wasordered simultaneously with this announcement The mobilization beganTuesday morning at Port Royal Thisreally means that the colony is to becoerced and terrorized into surrendering its constitutional governmentWhether this scheme will succeed ornot without a grave and highly sensational crisis remains to be seenBAD STORM IN MISSISSIPPIMany Dwellings

for the receptionof the prepared body the interior isseen to be perfectly white like the inside of a snow cave so intense is theheat But the inflowing air turns it toa delicate rosiness that cant beequaled in Italian skies I have seenpeople turn aw iv and say they recognized it as the only legitimate gatewayto the unseen universe doing away asit certainly does with all horror of thegrave and decayHendricks raised his handNot quite so last please he saidgently You have made a mistake 1hope I nm not dangerously ill 1 amonly confined to my room by a slightindisposition I may as well come tothe point I am a detective and it isoften for me to make inquiries into different businesses andA detective the devil Mr Simpkins blurted out and he flushed angrilyand reached for his hat My Lordwhat do you take me for Im no detective 1 have to earn meat and breadfor my family You are the second detective that has tried to take up mytime for nothing Sergeant Den Densomething came to my house and because I didnt give up my time andtell him all the ins and outs of raybusiness he threatened to have me upas an accomplice in that Palace hotelmurder My gosh I sent him abouthis business in

itIll do what I can to help you Theother fellow had such a lordly air abouthim and made himself so disagreeableI know him broke in Hendricksand then he turned to Dr LampkinPlease han me that little card--rawETHE BOURBON NEWS PA1US KT FRIDAY MARCH 3 1899Deeply interested in what was to flow the doctor obeyedTaking the box Hendricks removedthe lid and held the box to Mr SimpkinsIs it your opinion that those are theaches of a human body such as are produced from the retort of a regular crematoryThe individual addressed took the boxto a window and looked at the contentsclosely He had the air of a man whowas enjoying himselfGot a magnifying glass he askedshaking the ashes aboutHendricks produced his and Lampkintook it to the speakerThere was silence while Mr Simpkins was focusing the lens on theashes Then he came away from thewindow closing the magnifying glassIn my opinion they are not from theretort of a crematory he said thoughto be honest I would not take oath onitWhy are yon not positive askedthe detectiveMr Simpkins brows ran togetherHe smacked his lips and raised himselfon his toes in pure enjoyment of hiswell paid importanceBecause mj experienced eye detectstraces of the ashes of clothing hereIn well run crematories such residue isalways fanned away from the purewhite or grayish ashes of bone which isdeposited in urns for preservation Buthi the ashes of cloth may by accidenthave fallen back into the bone ash Icant be positiveAh I see said Hendricks Isthere any way by which one could distinguish between the ashes from a NewYork crematory or one in othercity 7None that I know of sirWell that is all and I thank youMr Simpkins said the detective leaning back in his chairWhen the man had taken his departure Lampkin askedCould the murderer have had thebody cremated in another cityEasier than here and he had ampletime said Hendricks in the tone of aman in deep and perplexed thoughtHe might have had a little trouble insi ipping the body but to get the ashesback here would be a very simple thingwould not be surprised at any dcvelopnrefttie this affair There is One pointthai bobs up here which is so puzzlingthat it almost drives me insaneWhat is that asked the doctorIt is this answered the detectiveYou see Caruthers had been out of thecity or rather was believed to have leftNew York ten days before I got myanonymous note telling me where Icould find his remains Now if thewriter believed that I would get thecommunication without delay the asheswere in Caruthers apartments a weekbefore I gn back from BostonOf course id Lampkin in the automatic tone of who speaks beforedeliberation Then he ejaculated withforce Oh yes certainlyBut said Hendricks with strongemphasis on the word if the hellscorched demon has had free access tomy office as I think he has had to mydining room then he could have seenthe communication which he hadmailed me lying on desk during myabsence It may really have been partof his plan to have mailed that letterknowing I wouldnt get it at onceBut for what reason asked thedoctorTo throw me off the track as totime said Hendricks 1 said theother day that this would prove thechief crime of all my experience I amnow afraid that it may actually be myWaterloo I have never dealt withsuch wonderful tact and boldness combine The chief reason for my believing that ho was on to my movements isthat Gielow did not leave until the nightI discovered the ashesCHAPTER XLTwo days later Hendricks was declared able to go down to his office Hehntl just finished dressing when hismother rapped on his doorYou hae a visitor in the drawingroom said the old lady with a smileA visitor grunted the detectiveimpatientlyA voting lady smiled Mrs Hendricks She would not give her namebut she is about the prettiest creatureI ever saw She is dressed in the latestfashion and drove up in her own carriageHendricks turned quickly and flushedslightlyTall am slender erect walks like aqueen golden brown hair and heavyeyebrows over eyes likeYes I think it is Miss Huntingtonsaid Mrs Hendricks when his fund ofadjectives was exhausted She is veryanxious to see youTell her Ill be right down saidHendricks She is just the person Iwanted to seeA moment later when he entered thelittle drawing room he found theheiress standing near a windowI am afraid I shall be e great intruder on your time she began as shetook his hand in the cordial clasp ofwhich there was a vague reassurancebut I have been to your office threetimes hoping to find you inHendricks cleared his throat He wasreally shocked at the alteration in herShe fiad grown thinner and her greatlustrous eyes shone from sockets inwhich there was no sign of bloodI am certainly glad you came hesTiid leading her to a comfortable chairI would have been pleased to have metyou to have Come to you but I havebeen confined to my room by a slight indispositionSo the office boy told me cried MissHuntington and I was so sorryIf there is any way in which I caneerve you I would be delighted to do ittaid Hendricks sitting down near herThe girl took a deep breath and whenshe spoke her voice vibrated with theimportance of her missionI went to my lawyers Howell andwanted to employ them and that I wasready if necessary to spend ever centof inheritance in Mr Gielows behalf They of course were glad to tender their services but when I told themof your politeness to me the othernight and that something seemed totell me jou would help me if it lay inyour power they declared at once thatyou could simply do anything youwished And then they told me theyhad been reading the papers and hadnot noticed that you were employed onthe case by the police and said if Icould retain you I ought to do it atonceHendricks bowed and smiled uncomfortablyI do not exactly understand hesaid slowly I I dont exactly seehow anybody at this stage could aidMr Gielow until we know more of thematterThe lawyers agree with me repliedthe heiress that he ought to be foundand brought back by his friends andnot wait till the police arrest himOh And Hendricks exclamationshowed that he was still in the darkI happen to know some things thatyou are unaware of hastily added MissHuntington and lny lawyers agreedthat if we could possibly retain youwith what I know we could help a littleI am willing to let you name your ownpriceHendricks sat up in his chair andcrossed his feetWed never quarrel over money matters Miss Huntington and as I amnot employed by the other side I pledgemyself to your causeA glow of color faintly tinged thehitherto bloodless face of the heiressYou are so good she said in ahusk- voice I know you will do allthat can be done and my lawyers thinkif we could get him to come back voluntarily and give himself up that wemight be able to prove that he was insaneInsane cried Hendricks his surprise driving away his timidityI am going- too fast said the girlplaintively I have not told you allA JlifV WHE TOOK THE BOX TO THE WINDOWand my lawyers advised me to do so assoon as you promised to join us Weknow that it would be folly to try toprove that he did not kill Mr Caruthersfor Mr Hendricks he actually confessed it to his servant and I have something else that puts it out of the question to doubt Henris word a letterfrom Mr Gielow himself In it he acknowledges the deedA letter from him exclaimed HendricksYes and in it there are absoluteproofs of unsoundness of mind OhMr Hendricks it drives me wild tothink that I have brought him to it andthat he may die for what he is morallyaccountable My lawyers admit thatit may be difficult to prove his insanitybut they say it is our only chance andthat we ought to begin our work atonceHendricks contracted his brows andshrugged his shouldersMay I see the letterMiss Huntington produced it fromher pocket and eyed him as he perusedit It ran as followsCharleston S C Dec 8Dear Dorothy When you get this youwill have heard of the murder of Caruthers Go at once to the studio ard makeHenri tell you of my confession Tell himI want him to testify against me as I wishno one else to be implicated in the slightest I regret what I have done but it is toolate for regrets now I sail from thistown to morrow for a foreign port to begin life anew Forget me and all thetrouble I have brought on you I had onetrue friend in New York besides yourselfIt Is Count Bantinni He suspected thatI was thinking of perpetrating a crime andplead with mo almost on his knees but Iwould not listen to reason I was crazy fromIt all I confessed to Henri and the countIn the studio The count tried to persuademe to turn myself over to the police butI eluded him and got away I have beenreading stories of crime and detection andthat coupled with my trouble turned myhead I fancied that I could invent a planfor doing away with my rival that wouldin its very boldness defy detection I evenwrote a letter to Mr Minard Hendricks tocause him to think the crime was committed by a personal enemy of his but at thelast moment I was unable to face it allThat you may forget me is the last wish ofARTHURDont you see that it is the letter ofan insane man asked the heiress hereager gaze resting on the face of thedetective as he lowered the letter Itis not at all like himIs it his hand asked Hendricks hibroad brow still wrinkledUndoubtedly 1 know his handwriting well See his name is written exactly as he signs his drawingsHendricks glanced at the signaturehis mind wandering to other thingsWe must submit it to a handwritingexpert he said I know a graphologist who has never made a mistakeWill you kindly send me something elsethat he has written and will you let meretain thisCertainly answered the girl thenshe nerved herself to ask and hear thereply to a leading question Co 3roudoubt hiffc insanity HendricksThe detective put the letter in it envelope sI have seen nothing in this letter toindicate insanity on the part of Gielowhe said after a moments pauseYou dont Well it ia not at allsuch a letter as he would have writtenif himself besides you have only to hearHenri describe how he acted when heconfessed to the murder to know thathe was insane that nightHendricks smiledil was behind a screen in the studiowhen you and your aunt came in thatnight I heard Henris descriptionMiss Huntington shrank back whiteand startledYou were she gasped and thenwhile Hendricks was nodding with theslow movement of a toy donkeys headshe added And and you still see yoproof of of insanityI must say that I do not was thdeliberate replyThe girl sat motionless It was as ifhe had deprived her of her last hopeHer great eyes seemed to expand Thenshe raised her gloved hands half way toher eyes and held them there as shesaidYou must believe him out of hisrnind Look at the address on that envelope He has directed it to me at thegeneral delivery Charleston S C Heknew I was not there Surely youseeI noticed that remarked Hendrickswhen he saw she was going no furtherAnd I also saw that the envelope borethe postmark of a railway the AtlanticCoast line The letter was mailed onthe train You see that road runs fromNew York to Charleston and from thispostmark it would be difficult to provewhether a letter were mailed on thetrain of that road near Xew York orrear CharlestonI cant possibly see what you meansaid the heiress helplesslyIf the letter is a forgery expladHendricks the writer of it would desire two things strongly First hewOuld want it to bear the Charlestc apostmark to guarantee the belief thatit came from that place and secondhe would want you to get it Now howwould a man without a confederate inCharleston succeed in gaining his pointIf this letter is forged the writer of itis an experienced villain for he knowsthat the government prevents its postmasters mailing letters sent to them forthat purpose It was found to be anavenue for much secret rascality so alaw was passed prohibiting it Wellwe will grant for the sake of argumentthat this forger knew that so what didlie do but direct this letter to you atCharleston and then drop a note to theCharleston postmaster requesting himin your name to forward your mail toyour street and number I am confident there is something shady about itfor as you can see from the postmarknearly two days elapsed before itreached Charleston as is shown by thepostmark of that office So you willsee that I have good reasons for believing the letter was mailed near NewYorkYou must pardon me said MissHuntington the languid largeness ofher eyes accentuating her despair butas I cannot believe it is not Mr Gielowswriting I am unable to enter into yourdeductionsShe had risen and Hendricks held outhis handIf you will post me the specimen ofhis handwriting at once Ill promiseto tell you something more definite assoon as I see Prof Westcott the handwriting expertI will send it to your office at onceshe replied despondentlyHendricks went to the window andwatched her as she descended the stepsHe fancied she had left abruptly to keepfrom showing her emotion As she wascrossing the pavement she swayed toone side and he thought she would fallbut she regained herself stepped firmly into her carriage and was drivenhomewardPoor girl he

her into the lake TheDI went homeSince Beckers arrest his secondwife 17-year-old Eda Sutterlin hasbeen in Beckercustody inquired continually for her asking the police whyshe was not released He wasalways given an evasive answer andapparently receiving the impressionthat Eda would insome way be connected with the disappearance of hisfirst wife Becker according to thetheory of the police made the confession in order to absolve her from anyblame The body of the murderedwoman has not yet been foundKeekers story of the crime is lookedupon with suspicion by many of theofficers who have been working on thecase All the evidence gathered hasindicated a far more brutal method ofmurder than drowning and the opinionis expressed that Becker finding himself cornered told a story that reflected

Florida Some so calledAmerican manufactured lead pencilsare made in Europe but the cedar fromwhich they are made all comes fromthis country It is shipped to Europe inconvenient sized logs and manufactured in proper shape after it arrivesthere There are a number of cedarsthroughout the world but the Floridacedar is particularly valuable in themanufacture of lead pencils It is of afine structure the grain being hardlyiistinguishable and can be worked upto the last inch In the various gradesof cheaper pencils other cedars canbe used but for the finer goods theAmerican cedar i exclusively usedFor all practical purposes all the penused in Europe are manufacturedof Florida cedar Much of the leadplumbago and graphite which is usedin them also comes from this countryThere are a number of woods in Europethat are used in the manufacture ofmatches but the American pines aregradually weeding them all out for thereason that the American pines can behandled and worked at less

Shaffers Deaerlatloa of thedost of the a in pa i ii inEastern IubuAs witnesses of the ceremony of surrender 1 took the general officers withtheir starts and a guard of 100 menGen Toral brought out with him hisgeneral officers and stalls and a body oftroops of the same number Jen Ludlow had given me the sword and spurstaken from the body of Gen Vara delHey who had been killed in the defenseof El Caney and requested me to givethem to Geh Toral During the interview prior to the declaration of surrender I handed Gen Toral the swordinforming him of the circumstancesand the request from the officer whohad secured it that it be taken back byGen del Keys companions to his homein Spain and given to his family Thepresentation of these articles was entirely unexpected by Jen Toral and asI spoke in English it was not until thetranslation was completed that he fullyrealized what 1 was doing He thenshowed a great deal of feeling in facthe could hardly speak as his emotionsnearly overpowered him He receivedthe sword and spurs and handed themto one of his staff all of whom wereequally surprised and gratifiedGen Toral then made the formaldeclaration of the surrender He placedhimself in front of the hundred menthat he had been permitted to bringout to represent the Spanish armywith his officers near him Our detachment was drawn up in lines frontingthem Advancing to the front of thecenter of his troops he drew his swordand presented arms and said I surrender the Spanish troops under mycommand and this place I was about20 feet in front of and facing him andcausing my command to present armsreplied that I accepted his surrenderin behalf of the government of theUnited StatesThis completed the ceremony of thsurrender so far as the troops wereconcerned Gen William

Visitto tlie Mysterious LaboratoryIn the spring of 1339 I was nsked toaccompany a party of gentlemen to theKeely laboratory for the purpose of witnessing an operative test of his motorMy age and cKptrience at the time didnot warrant my presence as an expertso I joined the party in the capacity ofan observer and listener This was aline of work in which I had acquiredconsiderable experience in connectionwith the investigation of spiritualismand in this particular instance I wassupposed to play my accustomed roleof noting everv word and act of thedemonstrator without sign or comment and then comparing the resultsof my observations with those of theothers presentWhen we arrived at the laboratorywe were ushered into the exhibitionroom on the second floor and assignedplaces of observation Mr Keely gaveus his usual introductory speech in thecourse of which he impressed on us thehonor he was conferring in permittingus to witness an exhibition of his ownparticular brand of force a force whichobeyed his laws and totally disregards dthe old fashioned and conventionallaws of nature We were then strictlyenjoined to remain in the various placesassigned to as under penalty of an immediate termination of the exhibitionTlie usual demonstration followedin which his motor which was performing the arduous work of turning itselfaround without load moved to right orleft slow or fast and even at timesstopped on receipt of proper notes fromeither a tuning fork or violin Themotor did not seem to care which instrument drew the note of demand provided the note was loud enough and itwas probably 00 this account that theviolin was finally substituted for thetuning fork Under the guidance of thetuning fork the motor balked severaltimes this Mr Keely explained wasdue to the fact that the turning forkharmonics was not strong enough tocontrol the polar or anti polar flowor the sympathetic cut reach or thesomething else which was vitalizing hismotor The violin seemed to poss---therequisite harmonic strength andall went smoothly for a time after itwas called into serviceAf terawhiilelgrew tiredof listeningand concluded it was hopeless to try toremember a lecture which introducedabout five words per minute thatneither Webster Worcester nor myselfhad ever heard before so beings malland inconspicuous 1 took advantage ofa particularly long and eloquent peroration to wander just a little First I fellagainst the receiver and found it verycold that made me think of Mr Ganotsfew brief remarks on the expansion ofair and other gases 1 realized however that I must not jump at conclusions for Mr Keely said his motor wasoperated by sympathy and you knowMr Editor how cold sympathy can beat timesFinding that my explorations wereonly being followed by my friends Iventured a little further and gentlytoyed with the wire which led the sympathetic vibrations to the receiver Itseem to be just a plain ordinary wireconstructed for business purposes onlybut I was curious enough to wonderwhether it differed from other wireswhich have no sympathetic duties toperformI argued that sympathy could reachout and exert its power through spaceeven though no wire was available andwhile I knew very little of Mr Keelysparticular brand of sympathy Ithought it would be a good time to testits wireless propertiesSo as I happened to have a poeketedition of side cutters about me I innocently cut the wire A quick hissfrom it followed and the motor suddenly ceased to mote Practically simultaneously Mr Keely stopped his discourse and directed his exclusive attention to me The Latter was the onlypart of the lively demonstration whichI clearly understood 1 could not mistake their meaning and import but ahealthy respect for postal regulationsprevents a verbatim reportFirst I tried to convince Mr Keelythat the cutting was accidental Helooked incredulous Then I offered tocut the wire which connected tlie receiver with the motor just to see if thepolarized and depolarized sympathieswould not balance one another I toldhim I was sure the motor would moteagain if he would only let me try nndthen if my theory was correct he couldin future save the expense of wires Iexplained that 1 had only cutoff tlie action end of his sympathy and if hewould let me cut off the react ion end allmight be well againI really dont believe Mr Keely gavemy arguments sufficient considerationYou see he had me folded close in hisarms and was helping me swiftly downstairs at the time One cant listen toreason very well while carrying evena medium sized man down a flight ofsteep stepsThere was no more demonstrationthat day but my associates agreed withme that given a source of sympathysuch as an air comprcsser there mustbe an outlet for the sympathy generated Pent up sympathy you know doesno one any good aaid is liable todamagethe holder thereof and surely a finestrong metal tube makes an excellentoutlet for sympathy and a few otherthings J F Stevens in ElectricalReviewAn

down awhilethen all at once it gave a lunge andpulled itself loose from The fenceand up it went with the little Harveychildren in the basket The motherwas looking out of a window and seeing the balloon going up told theaeronaut that his balloon had got awayfrom the fence and they all went out tosee it The mother came and as shewatched the balloon going up she noticed someone in the basket

Daring the OperationThere is one phase of the ship life ofthe American naval officer that isscarcely known to the layman and thatcan hardly be understood by him as helooks upon the modern ship in all herattractive cleanliness and meets herneatly uniformed officers upon the spotless upper deck Not only are the partsof the ship in sight kept clean and freefrom rust and decay but also those fardown contracted spaces that never seethe light of day These include the cellular oompartments between the innerand outer skins of the ship known technically as the double bottom andother places that separate the magazinesand various built up structures withinthe ship from the outer skinThese narrow compartments are especially susceptible to dampness and rustand in order that those who have thecare of them may do their duty welland so prevent the decay of the ship asystem of inspection has been devisedand the inspectors most be under thenaval regulations commissioned officers A permanent board of inspectionis formed upon each ship which mustconsist of one engineer and two line officers The duty of this board is periodically to make personal inspections ofall the parts of the ship examine everything critically suggest remedies forany evils that may be found to existand to report to the commanding officer for transmission to the navy department the condition of the vessel indetailUniforms are discarded while making these inspections and clad in seamens ordinary working suits these officers crawl upon all fours throughout thelength of the bottom of the ship wriggle snakelike through narrow openingsand examine with their own eyes everyinch of the surface of the thin steelplates The paint of these compartments softened by dampness in someplaces and by heat and the steam ladenair of the boiler rooms in others rubsoff upon the working suits and anhours crawling transforms the neatofficer into a very sorry spectacle Insome modern navies this duty is performed by the enlisted men the officersbeing excused from it but in our navythe feeling exists that an enlisted manshould not be asked to go where an officer is not willing to lead The result isthat things always work with theAmericans and the efficiency of the fleetis assuredNumerous precautions must be takento avoid the risk of losing life whiieperforming this duty for it is attendedwith no little danger The atmosphereof confined spaces entirely or partlyclosed for a considerable length of timebecomes robbed of its oxygen in theformation of rust and is soon made unfitto sustain life If possible such compartments are blown out with pure airled through a hose from a blower ductand all manhole plates removed beforebeing entered A lighted candle is always carried by the inspecting officerupon his crawling tour If the candleburns dimly or seems upon the point ofbeing extinguished there is a deficiencyof oxygen and he will immediatelyseek the nearest opening leading fromthe compartment and leave it at onceMen are stationed at places as near aspossible to him so that theymay hearhis voice and render immediate assistance in case of need No one is allowedto enter any confined space on boardship without an uncovered light although in addition a portable electriolight is carried frequently to render theinspection more thoroughIt not infrequently happens that officers and men become so wedged betweenbulkheads and beams while performingthis duty as to make it extremely difficult to remove them and more than uueofficer of the navy is upon the retiredlist today because of permanent injuryto his health contracted while performing this arduous labor Because of thecare exercised it is rare that a life islost in this service but in one case atleast the rashness of a man proved fatalto him One of the main boilers of thecruiser Newark while flagship of thesouth Atlantic station having beentightly doted for a month while emptyin order to preserve it from deterioration the coppersmith of that vessel anenergetic faithful man thought its interior should be examined and although warned repeatedly never to enter such a boiler without an open lightremoved an upper manhole plate andcrawled in upon the braces with anelectrio light He told no one that hewas going into the boiler and no onewas stationed to assist him in case ofneed His dead body was found half outand half in the boiler manhole with theelectrio light still burning brightlywithin the boiler He had evidentlycrawled in upon the braces felt a faintness creeping over him and had endeavored to regain the open air but lostconsciousness just as life lay withinhis reach and so died of asphyxiationThe air in the boiler had been entirely robbed of its oxygen by the iron ofthe shell in the formation of rust andthe residuum was unfit to breathe Alighted candle was snuffed out immediately upon oiug thrust into the boilerand this condition prevailed until alower manhole plate was removed whenthe heavy gas rah out as water mightand ti o air within soon came to bequite pure No more vivid illustrationof the dangers to be encountered in thecare of ships afloat and the precautionsnecesrv to be taken in this duty eouldbe given than this incident whictashows that shot and shell and burstingsteam pipes are not the only dangersthat oouiruut the officers and men olfI UUncle Sams navy New York SuaTURNED THE

handkerchief and pretending towipe away a tear I sailed the Bait seawith your brother We were wreckedtogether in the gulf of Mexico and before help came I killed and ate him 1The moment I saw you I reoognized thelikeness He was a good fellow full oftender feelingI am glad you found him tenderinterrupted Byron also pulling out hishandkerchiefBut sir I am awfully sorry I atehim said Artemus in the most imperturbable fashion Had I known 1should ever meet his brother I am sureId have gone without food some weekslonger But I was driven to it and youwill forgive me wont you I likedAlonzo and he offered his hand toByron which the latter shook with cordalityExcuse my emotion wont yougasped Byron in his handkerchief Henever wrote and told me what had become of him I hope he agreed withyonA slight indigestion afterward Hewas a little tough replied Artemusbut well not speak of that We bothsuffered He suffered most But remember sir the law cant touch me nowIt was stern necessity and
