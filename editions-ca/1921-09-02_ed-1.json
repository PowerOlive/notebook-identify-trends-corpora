The man had worshipped a beautful woman. Had laid all his love and hopes at her feet. Only to find her a cold and kill
ing mockery. The girl had worshipped her father. Thought him a saintly benefactor of men. Only to find him a murderous
rogue. Sd here life had tumbled them broken, hopeless, abandoned a little more clay in a mire of an underworld dive. But
the clay was warm with youth, and in it a glimmer of old, fine dreams. A screen romance like nothing ever shown before.
Athrob with stirring events. ' Alluring in its beauty. Warm with the beat of hungry human hearti.

STEPHENSON McCLINTOCK
Verily, romance is not yet dead,
and the devious ways of sly Dan
Cupid are hard to fathom. Romance
grows in the heart of youth and the
call of youth to youth is insistent
and will not be denied. Romance
does not 'discriminate, and laughs
and exults with the young as, well
as the old.
Cupid's latest victims in this part
of God's country were two well
known and very popular young Bour
bon county people, James C. McClin
tock, of Paris, and Miss Sara Ste
phenson, of near Clintonville, who
were united in marriage Monday
evening in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
The young couple, who have been
sweethearts for some time, did not
waste time trying to obtain license
here, but were driven to Lexington
in the automobile of a mutual friend,
Vail Baldwin. From there theypro
ceeded to .Jeffersonville, where they
were made mam and wife at the home
of the officiating minister, pastor of
one of the Presbyterian churches of
that city.
, Following a short bridal trip
Mr. and Mrs. McClintock returned ro
Paris, where they are receiving the
congratulations and best wishes of a
legion of friends.
The bride is the youngest daugh
ter of Squire and Mrs. Lee Stephen
son, of near, Clintonville, and is ti re
markably handsome and attractive
young woman. She is very accom
plished and popular in social circles
of Paris and the surrounding towns.
