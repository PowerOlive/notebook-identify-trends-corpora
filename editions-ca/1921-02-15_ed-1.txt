O.Marshall, voluntarily confessed to methat there were some irregularities inthe books of this office, the exactamount of which he was unable tostate.As he has kept all books of theSheriff's office for the past sevenyears, I have not been able to makeor have made a complete audit of hisbooks to ascertain the exact amountof his deficit, if any; and until suchaudit is made, the exact amount canriot be stated. His brothers at oncecame forward and have offered andagreed to pay any shortage thatmight exist, and are anxious to knowthe amount, so that it might be madegood; but his condition is such thathe has not been able to assist us ingoing over the books. In order toprotect the interest of the taxpayers,a warrant was issued for h:sarrest, and he has waived examiningtrial and given bond, with his brothers as sureties, for his appearancebefore the March term of Court, toanswer any charge that may bebrought against him.I did not require any bond of himas deputy sheriff but" I am liable onmy official bond for any delinquencies that may have occurred during my term, and I am ready to payany such as soon, as the amount maybe ascertained.His brothers are ready to pay anydelinquencies, and, in fact, offeredto pay the same before the warrantfor his arrest was issued.There is absolutely no danger ofany loss to the State or county, or tomy sureties.As far as I am at this time advisedit appears the deficit will not exceedfifteen thousand dollars and may beless.Yours trulyW.

T. Hagan, architect,on "City Planning" has been thesubject of enthusiastic comment.Mr Hagan has made a special study.tio , rpT, ln f!ftion craitioi.s in Paris, and his method ofpresenting the subject at the meeNing has aroused much enthusiasmover the eventual adoption of a systematic plan for development. A.'city plan,, he explained, would com.prise the making of various surveys,presenting the exact manner in'which new streets should be laid.buildings constructed and parks andplaygrounds added to the city. Theplan would prevent factories andmills from being built in residenceor business districts and would require that all proposed new additions to the city, new streets, buildings and other improvements be ap-proved by a city plan commission.In opening his address, Mr. Hagansaid that Paris is "no mean city, '.but the trouble is that we do notknow it. "When we can bring ourselves, as a city, to realize ourunique position as an agriculturaltrade center, and to the great possibilities that are before us, we willhave accomplished much towardrecognition as one of the leadingcities of the State." He defined acity as "a company of God's children, bound together by unity ofeconomic ana spiritual interests.Reading eytracts from Collins' His-toiy of Kentucky, he gave the information that Paris was established as a city by legislative act in17 89 under the name of Hopewell.Latei the name was changed toBourbonton ?-nd finally to Paris, "inthe plentitude of good feeling,"which then existed toward Paris,France. In 1826, according to Collins' history, "The Bourbon cattleweie unsurpassed in beauty or inthe fine quality of their meat byany in the United States." "Do weto-day hold the same reputation?"Mr. Hagan asks. "Is there any onething or group of things now produced in Bourbon county for whichshe is, nationally famous? The daysof prohibition are upon us and itseems that 'Old Bourbon' has lost itskick. But not Bourbon county. Shestands to-day with the same fertility of soil that she has alwayspossessed and only waits upon thecity of Paris to point the way togreater achievement.""Can we as a c:ty lead the waywhen we continue in our haphazardcourse to grow along the lanes andalleys that by charca have been lefcin our unsystematic layout? Shallwe continue to be led by the charmof thft broad vista and the distantperspective afforded by the roadleading to Lexington?"He explained that a city planwould render the stieet and building layout of the city more convenient, as well as more beautiful, andthat the suiding purpose of a cityplan would be to give the city anindividuality, or personality. Hetraced the steps necessary in thedeveloping of a city plan and the appointment of a commission tu regulate material improvements in thefuture. The cost of instituting sucha plan, he said, is small when compared with results, and the relativerise in property values. 'City planning is good business and good business pays.' "In conclusion he stated that hehad presented the needs and advantages of a systematic layout forParis and ho" "ion a plan could bepin into action. "I would not appealto your pride. Are we faithful tothe trust that has been given us?Our ancestors builded well. It hasbeen given to us to carry on Shallwe do it wisely or not? When shallwe cease to extend our city in thepresent haphazard way and adoptan orderly means of going forward?"TO TAGE "BIBIU CONTEST."Fortj'-five groups of boysfrom thevarious -High and Grammar schoolsof the State have registered in theannual Bible study contest unnerthe auspices of the State Y.
