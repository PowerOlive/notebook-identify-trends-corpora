It is about 500 milesfrom Culbera and 1,000 miles fromColon. Its adjacent waters,"" including the Gulf of Caricao, would makeit admirably adapted as a naval base.ROME, June 4.

The father or motherare possibly not to blame for those'who now bump shoulders with theworld to find that in many instances a registered certificate of birthis of as great importance as a certificate of marriage. In days gone bythe family Bible was considered allsufficient. And in those days peopletook other people's word for many'things that fail to go unquestionednow.To-day It is different. The childborn into the world now is entitledto have its name recorded in the big''Kentucky family bible" at the cap- ts.l of the State. In fact, there is alaw in the State of Kentucky thatmakes it mandatory upon the attending physician to register births. In.Ohio there has been several instanceswherein physicians have treated thislaw lightly, and in several instancesthey have been called to account,wfth the result that at least two oftKem came dangerously near forfeiting" their license to practice medi-- cine."It is to be hoped that the physicians of Paris and Bourbon countywill look at this law in the light itdeserves. Special agents of theUnited States census bureau are herenow investigating to see if all babiesborn are being promptly and properly registered. , Birth registration isJ of vital Interest to our welfare andthe welfare of our country in coming years. Military conditions nowarising shows plainly the need of aclean certificate of birth. The public demands it; the parents preferit; the babies born are entitled toit, and THE NEWS sincerely hopesthat every physician in Paris andBourbon county will not be lax intheir duties now of at any futuretime.Pire Traps.i ' Paris," along with every other townor city in the country had an excellent lesson the week in thedestructive fires which visited Atlanta, Georgia, and Lexington, Ky.In Paris there exists, just as thereexisted in Atlanta and Lexington, anumber of dilapidated, fast-decaying.hovels, that are fire hazards of thejot dangerous type.

Atlanta and Lexington are mourning aloss to-day of millions of dollarsworth of property merely becausethey permitted a number of dilapidated old frame buildings, almost untentable, but still drawing a few dollars a year in rentals, to remain Intheir business districts. There mustbe somewhere in the city ordinances,or within the State 'fire laws, something to afford relief and do awaywith this danger.DRAWING THE NET.While Germany is sending bombthrowers to Southern England to killwomen and children America is preparing to send 10,000 areoplanes toFrance for use against Germany.Brazil is getting into the war. Japanhas sent destroyers to European waters to fight submarines. Spain isabout to get into the fight. The.neutrality of the .Scandinavian countries is getting frayed out. China,seemingly will enter the war. Chileproposes to do so.Germany and Austria and Bulgariaand Turkey constitute a large area,and when newspapers speak of Germany, without thinking of the othercountries now governed by, ratherthan allied with, Germany, too littlenotice is taken of the importance ofthe extension of the German Empireas a result of the war. Neverthless,the net is tightening. Great Britainseems to be dealing with the submarines, and every month brings greatercertainty of the outcome of the war.Russia; still is the unknown quantity,but civilization will win, even without Russia's help, if need be.Germany, "frightful' to the last,will pay for frightfulness when thetreaty of peace is drawn.

In place of raisingand depressing his sending key, hesends his dots and dashes by modulating his voice to produce long andshort intervals. The principle of thesender is the same as that of theordinary type. In the usual sender,the raising and depressing of the keyopens and closes the circuit to produce the dot and dash. In the newtype, a delecate diaphram is so arranged that the vibrations in the airset up by- the voice open and close thecircuit in a telephone, and producethe same result.WHOOPING COUGH.In this disease it is important thatthe cough be kept loose and expectoration easy, which can be done bygiving Chamberlain's Cough Remedy.Mrs. J.

Is anyone surprised?Lying to the Pope will strike persons who are neither" superstitiousnor profoundly religious as being arather rotten thing for a monarch todo, but is there any crime the headof the German Empire would notcommit?Surely not. A ruler who can "fordisciplinary purposes" order criminalassaults upon Belgian women, selecting the market place of Liege as thescene of the crimes, lest the news offrightfulness might not travel fast orfar enough to have its effect, is capable of every infamy. And various investigators agree that the outrageswhich began in Belgium with the beginning of the invasion were ordered,as a part of the fundamental militarypolicy of Germany.What, in comparison, is merely lying to the Pope?SOUR STOMACH.This is a mild form jf indigestion.It is usually brought on by eatingtoo rapidly or too much, or of foodnot suited to your dige?tive organs.If you will eat slowly, masticate yourfood thoroughly, eat but little meatand none at all for supper, -you willmore than likely avoid the .sourstomach without taking any medi-i cine whatever.

Only the girlsare different, and only the frocksthey wear are different.Many a fashion authority, I amsure, is being consulted already asto how the graduation frock shouldbe made. First the material, thenthe style. These are the two important items in planning the graduation frock.Crisp Organdy Faahions this Dress.The choice of the material depends on how much is to be spent onthe dress; the choice of a style depends on your figure and your individual taste.

August and September arerated the critical time whenfires are most numerous and disastrous. ThesQ are the driest months ofthe year on the Pacific slope, and inconsequence the grass and brush inthe forests are tinder dry and offer theleast resistance to fire.Throughout the dry season, whichbegins about April and extends throughthe early part of November, according to the latitude of the different states, the forest service of thedepartment of agriculture increasesjtsworking forces until it has a hosfofmen throughout, the ranges ever on thealert for fires. These additional forcesaugment the regular range force, whichis on duty, the year round.High up on some lonely peak, farfrom the centers of civilization, standsa high watchtower that daily is thepost of a forest ranger, who, with powerful binoculars and telescope, is on thelookout for the thin, telltale banner ofvapor that tells Its own story of thefight ahead to the watcher. On otherpeaks there are similar watchtowers,and the watchers here, too. may markthe rising column of smudge from afar.AH report to a central station, wherethe fire Is accurately located.At each watchtower there is a circular map of tbe district within theview of that particular tower. By trlangulation on this map the watchernotes the direction of the fire from histower. The other watchtowers do thesame, and all report to the central station these various directions. "Wherethe triangulation Hues meet on thegreat map of the -central station therethe fire is. It is a simple and yet amost effective method. The fire located, the fighting forces of the districtare mobilized and the battle begins.It may be short, and it may last forweeks, but it is fought none the lessrelentlessly.Stretching in every direction fromthe central ranger stations are milesof telephone and telegraph wires thatare used in time of danger to mobilizethe fire fighting army. Once the callhas been made they come from everydirection prepared to combat the common enemy. Frequently these firesoccur within a short distance fromsmall villages and towns, and then theproblem becomes more complex, in thatthe homes, once aflame, are extinguished wltlTgreater difficulty.Besides the use of the telephone andtelegraph, the forest rangers also usethe heliograph, with which they areable to send flashes of sunlight manymiles to bring aid. These are wheretelephone and telegraph lines are notyet available. At centrally located depots are caches of dynamite that arealso used for signaling purposes. Atthese depots are stored materials forfire fighting purposes and highly specialized apparatus.Rigid rules have been laid down -forpersons camping in the woods, and thefire permit system has lessened thenumber of fires very appreciably. Thegreatest loss comes from the negligent pleasure seekers, who drop lighted matches in the grass and lowbrush. The fire permit cards can beobtained either at the general office orof any ranger, and there is no expenseThe good accomplished by this arrangement appears in thefact that when a fire breaks out It ispossible to know who had a permit tobuild a fire in that territory, for aclose record is kept of the permits issued. The fire permit card authorizes theholder to build camp fires on the national forest land between certaindates, provided the following requirements are complied with: To buildsmall fires nly, to build fires In theopen and not against a tree or log orwithin twenty feet of standing brush,to scrape away all leaves and trashfrom around the fire, never to leave afire unattended, even for a short time,without first extinguishing it; to extinguish fires first use water, thencover with dirt; bonfires are not allowed. It is further provided thatwhen camp is moved the ground mustbe left in a clean and sanitary condition.

Thenet has floats on top that keep bobbing up and down like the float on afishliiie, and on the bottom are weight?,that keep the whole thing in a perpendicular position.The submarine cannot submerge tcvery great depths on account of thepressure, 200 feet being about the limiting depth. It sails Innocently along,therefore, until it pushes its nose intothese meshes. The net now trailsalong on both sides of the submarine,its progress revealing the fact thatsomething below is supplying the motive p6wer.Perhaps the net suddenly stops.That means that the hidden submarinohas' stopped, Its navigators havingmade the horrible discovery that theyare trapped, or perhaps the net hasbecome twisted in the propeller. Under these conditions the wise submarine rises to the surface. It surrenders,becomes the propeity of the enemy,and fts crew are made prisoners.If it does not take such action oneof two things will happen. The enemywill wait upon the surface until thesubmersible comes up, or if it startsmoving the enemy will follow untilthe inevitable uprising. But perhapsthe surface commander gets impatient.In such a case he can let a bombdown into the water, which will explode when it touches the roof of thesubmarine. Of course the submergedsubmarine knows that this bomb islikely to drop at any minute. Thepsychology of such a situation tendsto persuade the Imprisoned crew tosurrender.
