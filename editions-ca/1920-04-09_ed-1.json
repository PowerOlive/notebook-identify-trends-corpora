AHOTEER MYSTERY SOLVED
Sometime ago a 'valuable cow be
3onging to Deputy Sheriff Robert" M.
Gilkey, disappeared in a mysterious
manner from his farm near North
Middletown. A vigorous search
ade along the highways and by
ways in the surrounding country
failed to locate the missing animal.
Mr. Gilkey conducted a personal
search party in all the neighborhood
hut could not locate the m animal.
Days passed and as he was about to
give up all hopes of ever recovering
the cow, the unexpected happened.
Hearing an unusual noise near
one of the side windows at his
home earJy in the morning -very la
tently he got up and made an in
vestigation. Securely tied to a win
dow catch by a short rope was the
missing cow. and by her side stood
a little calf, only a few days old.
Lateivn the day came the explana
tion. A .neighbor informed Mr. Gil
key that he had discovered 'the cow
on "his place and had brought her to
the house and tied her there. "There
iad. been 'so many mysterious re
turns of pioperty that had been tied
to doorknobs that I- thought I would
surprise you, Bob.:: the neighbor
- said. Thus was another perplex
ing mystery solved without the aid
of detecties.

1 can 'Legion w5s" given in a state
! ment issued by Arthur Woods, chair
man of the National Americanism
Commission, from National head
quarters in Indianapolis.
Mr. Woods said he had learned
f that the "reds" are seeking enroll-
ment in the Legion in an effort to
lear-n what action the former ser
vice men's organizations is taking
against them and their policies.
"No real harm, however, can ho
done to the Legion or its work of
promoting Americanism by the
presence in its membership of such
persons," declared Mr. Woods. "W.
are working to promote public wel
fare and good citizenship and the
more they find out about this work
the better. It will do them good.
"They will find it very difficult
yes, impossible, to convert to a belief
in anarchjr men of the stuff that
characterizes our membership, and
they will run grave risk of being
converted themselves to ahelief in
law and order as. a perequisite to
social and economic justice and hap
piness. o v
