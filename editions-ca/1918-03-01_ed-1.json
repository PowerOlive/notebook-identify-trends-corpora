METER WHICH REGISTERS ...
TELEPHONE CALLS.
A recently invented terephone
meter, described and illustrated in
the March Popular Mechanics Mag
azine, is designed to prevent errors
in charging calls and to make the
service more satisfactory to the sub
scriber in other respects. Bein or
comparatively simple construction
it can be installed in the signal case
of a coin-operated telephone with
slight alterations. The device com
prises two counters which are tc
tuated electrically and are located
just back of the apertures in the
f ont case so that they are visible to
the subscriber. When the device is
used with a coin-used telephone it
shows the subscriber at all times
how many calls have been made.
