followed byexposure fo the rays of the sun produces fever not necessarily yellow fever but an attack something similar towhat is known as swamp fever in Mississippi orchagres in the isthmus ofPanamaThe same belief prevails in Centraland South America but in a greaterdegree On both coast lines of Nicaraguaa light shower is the signal for a general scampering indoors and a disinclination to come out again until thesky is perfectly clear Up on the highplateau on which the city of Caracas inVenezuela is situated and where thereshould belittle or no fear of fever thenatives are afraid to

but so far it has never appeared before the joint commissionsave in the shape of one spasmodic effort made by the Spaniards at theof the sessions to have theUnited States abandon Manila as aprecedent

AgainKe Kstabllsh Authority Over the Remaining Islands Without a Prolonged War With InsurgentsWashington Oct 31 President McKinley is convinced that there is noway in which the United States canescape the responsibility of taking allthe Philippines lie has arrived atthis conclusion after mature deliberation lie at first favored keepingnothing more than a military andnaval base and thought that theUnited States should in no event retainmore than the island of Luzon Whenthe American peace commissioners leftfor Paris it 4was not contemplatedthat they should demand from theSpanish government more than the absolute cession of this one island to theUnited States and a reversionary interest in the other islands of thegroupIt has been found however thatthere were many practical difficultiesin the way of such a solution not theleast of them being the evident impossibility of Spains re establishing authority over the remaining islandswithout a prolonged and bloody struggle with the insurgent forcesInformation coupled with the opinion of military and naval commandersfamiliar with the Philippine situationhave led the president to believe thatAdm Deweys destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila bay and Gen Merritts capture of Manila annihilatedSpanish sovereignty in the islands andit became a duty of the United Statesto establish a better government thanthe one which was destroyed by American armsThe president has been deluged withletters from all parts of the UnitedStates and with resolutions from commercial and religious bodies urgingthat American sovereignty should bemaintained wherever the flag has beenplanted -In this same line the presidents recent western trip was a revelation to him and the members of hiscabinet who accompanied him Thefurther he went west the stronger hefound the sentiment in favor of holding all the Philippines and establishing an American government overthemSecretary Gage who went west before the president and who went asfar as Denver found the sentimentthere even stronger than in OmahaIn all the meetings of the cabinet before the peace commissioners left forParis Secretary Gage was the mostconservative of all the presidents advisers-He doubted the wisdom oftaking even as much as the Island ofLuzon and would have been glad if away had been found of relinquishingall the Philippines Since his returnfrom the west however he is an advocate of holding all the islandsAlthough it has been finally determined that the Philippines shall be retained the peace commissioners maybe given considerable latitude as tothe terms on which they are to be retained The Philippines are regardedas standing on a different basis fromCuba and Porto Rico andsome of themembers of the administrationbelieve that if all the islands are taken Spain should begiven some measure of compensationfor them especially as the Philippineshave been by far the most valuable ofall her coloniesIt can be said that it is quite probable that the American commissionerswill be authorized to go so far as tooffer to pledge the United States toassume the Philippine debt or at leastsuch portion of it as has been expendedon the public works in the islandsThe exact amount of the debt thatcould be properly charged to the United States under such an arrangementcould not be accurately stated withouta fuller analysis of this debt than asyet has been made but it is believedthat it will be less than 840000000AN EMERGENCY SQUADRONGreat Uritain is Assembling One at Devonport Its Destination is Siid to lieGibraltar Great ActivityLondon Oct 31 There was

to relieve the guardCHAPTER X ContinuedOne oclock came and the call hadgone from sentry to sentry thanks tothe breathless stillness of the air andthe moon was climbing high and Duxwas still up and swearing A wirecame out from the Junction that thespecial would not be there for twohours so the Riflers had stacked armsunslung packs and were snoozing orskylarking as suited their humor Thecolonel had given permission for adance at Miguels The band was playing and there was jollity in the windDux said he wouldnt have the cavalrymixed up in any such tomfoolery however and the patrol was saddled andready to start Grafton coming backfrom his stable where he had gone topersonally see to the selection of themounts required stopped and drewMerriam to one sideIm sorry for the needless troubleyou took this evening Merriam I hadhoped that Mrs McLane would see youand have done with it Another dispatch came for her three hours ago andit seems to have roused her to actionShe was up and dressed in time to seethe regiment off and now I presumeshes flirting with Whittaker Thereare lights in the parlor At all eventsthe orderly hasnt fouiM him and Buxmay send you after the stragglers intownThen I reckon Ill start ana makethe rounds and get out of the waysaid Handy By the way captain Ihope your private stable is well securedWe have only one sentry on that wholefront now aud that matched team

the corrals first said heand then come over your wav GoodnightThe lights were still burning dimlyin the parlor as Grafton reached hisquarters but the slender form of awoman stood between him and the doorIt was Mrs McLane and she began atonceI have been waiting anxiously fcryou captain Dear Harriet has gone toher room tired out and I thought MrWhittaker would never go T fairly hadto send him Mr Merriam is officer ofthVgruard Could T see him could youlate me t him for-just-a minute If1 can talk nth him three mitnites itwill he ample and I cannot rest nowuntil I doGrafton was on the point of biddingher remember that she had refused achance of talking with him earlier thatnight but refrained He looked backacross the sallow moonlit surface of theparade to where the oil lamps wereburning blearily in the guardroom Heis not there said he He has gonedown to the corrals But a happythought striking him in less than tenminutes he will be coming through hereon his rounds I gave him the key ofour rear gate Its warm and pleasantaut here You might hail and halt himas he entersMeantime there had been a sore sorehearted young wife farther up the rowAs wrath and passion sobbed themselves away and the devil of jealousywore itself out and the thought ofRandys patience and gentleness andof all that Mrs Hayne had said of hisunflagging tenderness and love poorFlorence began to wonder if she had notangered him beyond repair nis lastact had been one of fond thoughtfulcare He had spread the shawl over herand lingered over it as though he lovedto touch her mad miserable uglyhateful as she had been and she hadspitefully thrown it off She picked itup now and strove to arrange it as hehad done but could not She aroseand bathed her face and eyes and gazedout over the now deserted parade Shehad not even stirred when the Riflersmarched away She paced the flooragain and felt that she was weak andbecame conscious that she was mostunromuntically hungry and then Ohheavens how could she how couldshe have forgotten nere was Randyon guard up all nightf and never beforesince they came back from their wedding tour had she failed when he wasofficer of the guard to have a delightfullittle chafing dish supper all ready forhim at 12 oclock and he used to comeover from his dutips for half an hourand eat with such an appetite and praiseher Welsh rarebit or her oysters andthen take her in his arms with such loveand delight in his fond eyes and hereand here it was one oclock ard shedutterly forgotten it Oh poor Randymust be starvingIn ten minutes Mrs Merriam hadbundled up her dishevelled hair donnedsome more becoming gown than thetumbled wrapper and had bustleddownstairs and lighted the parlor lampto signal Randy to come home and befed and forgiven and then she ransacked the cupboard and started herfire and then peeped over toward thedistant guardroom and saw 110 sign ofhis coining She trotted through thekitchen and banged lustily at HopLings door and bade him rise and gosummon his master but the menial answered not He too had slipped awayto the Junction not so much to see theRiflers off as to have a shy at fan tanand Florence was alone Never mindShe had been born and reared in garrison No one could teach her the insand outs of post life Why shouldntshe run across the wide dimly lightedflat and surprise her darling at his deskand bid him come home with her andlet her twine herself about him andhave a happier crj as she told him howweak and wicked and cruel and hatefulshe had been and beg to be taken backinto his love and trust Yes yes wellshe knew that he was too noble toogrand to treat her sternly coldly because of her tempestuous outbreak Itwas all because she loved him so lovedhim so that it was torture to think anyother woman could claim or hold oreven attract him With brighteningeyes with bounding heart she threwover her head and shoulders a lightwrap and stepped out on the piazzaSomebody was coming across the parade from the guardhouse even nowHe was still too far away to be recognized but as he halted one minute andturned as though to listen to the sentries just beginning to call half pastone the moonlight glinted on the steelscabbard and she knew it must beRandy Then he was coming to herafter all and she need not have to seekhim and be the first to make up asshe used to say in girlish days Thecall went round with echoing ring andthen on came her loving husband againilow she loved that martial stride ofhis now erect and strong and soldierly he seemed How why hewasnt coming straight to her He hadreached the flagstaff There lay thebeaten pathway right before his eyesand hers He must see the bright lightsof his home bidding him come and findlove and welcome But he had turnedaway was walking not toward thewest end but straight for the middle ofthe row straight to where the Graftonslived where that woman livedBut that meant nothing Oh noFlorence well knew that meant nothing Had he not said only a little whilebefore that never would he see or speakwith her without coming first to hiswife his Florence and letting herknow Yet why should he go thitherat this hour of the night That was notine way to the sentry posts Unconsciously she approached the edge oE thepiazza she saw him reach the roadwaysaw him cross it saw him merciful God could she believe her eyes Asaw him enter what must be theGraftons gate and then become lost inthe shadows of the row Hardly knowing what she did Florence sped madlydown the steps out through the gateand almost running down eastwardalong the walk Kearing the Graf tonsshe pressed her hand to her heart tostill its mad pounding and as she cameopposite the parlor window she notedthat the lamps were burning dimlylate as it was Could he have enteredBreathless dazed she clung to thepicket fence for support not knowingwhat to do next and then the bloodseemed to turn to ice in her veins forsomewuere close at hand just beyondthose sheltering vines she heard voiceshis voice and hers low toned earnestah passionate for she heard her murmur Oh Randy Randv andstepping quickly forward saw her justaround the corner of the trellist Jently clinging to his arm the two dim Ingurcs seemingly linked togetherblending in one vague indistinguishable yet damning shape and then allgrew dark to her as though a pall hadbeen dropped from the starrv hpnvpnshiding from sight the sin and woe of areeling worldCHAPTER XIMrs McLane Merriam was sayingat the moment interrupting the pleading weeping womanwho was clingingto his arm it is useless to talk of itHad you let me know why you wished tosee me all the pain of this meetingcould have been avoided Every paperI had was given to Mr Parry your lawyer months ago I know less about thematter probably than you do andnow forgive me but I must go at onceAlmost forcibly he drew her claspinghands from his arm and turningsharply and without another word to thecringing woman hastened on throughthe narrow pathway that led betweenGraftons cottage and that to the eastward and presently emerged again intothe moonlight at the back of the housegoing straight to the captains stableFor a moment his late companion stoodthere at the trellis staring after him inmingled misery and incredulity Shehad planned it well She had markedhis coming just as Graftonhad said hadhurried down to the shady aisle between the quarters and halted himthere astonished at her daring Hewould have walked a dozen miles thatnight rather than see her at all but tomeet her this way to feel that he wastrapped made Merriams blood boilwith wrath His voice though wasstern and cold as he bade her say whyshe wished to see him But her aim wasto dietain to soften to charm and thento plead and she had a dreadful dreadful story to tell and none to tell it tobut him Even then she Avas balked forMerriam bluntly bade her omit thestor as he knew all he needed to knowand come to the point at once Whattcould she want of him Advice sympathy she cried and for advice he referred her to her lawyer for sympathyshe must not come to him She musthave some purpose in calling on himwhat was it And then it proved to bethe packet with certain papers givenhim by the young miner in the Mesealero It was turned over to yourlawyer long ago said Randy and thenshe burst into tears and said she wasundone and wailed Oh Randy Randy what can I what am I to do Andhe suggested gravely courteously butpositively that she should at once goindoors while he went on his wayHis heart was bitit against her as hestrode outbeyondthefencelineand aft-ti9rsjzij s j- r ffiJa 5in -vi yiVL

jealoustrouble He turned toward his owngate intending only to glance at theother stables on the way and give thesentry additional orders but when hegot so far toward the western end of therow as to enable him to distinguish anyobject as big as a man he found to hisvexation that there was no sentry thereat all and that he must retrace hissteps and look for him toward the otherend It was a backward tramp of over300 yards and he was irritated enoughto feel like scoring the sentry whenfinally he came upon himYou shouldnt be here sir he began after the customary challenge andreply Where you are most needed isalong toward the other end where thereare private horses in flimsy stablesI knew sir said the soldier promptly but theres something amiss outthere on the road toward town I hearda scuffle aud cries for help and then arunning down into the creek bottomThe corporals gone out to see Imafraid theres been blood spilt sirAud even as they stood and listenedThe still night air was split by the loudreport of a carbine echoed back fromthe opposite wall of the shallow narrow canj on It was followed almostinstantl b a cry for aidCome right along shouted Merriamto the sentry and he sprang away inthe direction of the alarm Xevermindyour postA run of nearlj 400 yards crossingdiagonally the Junction road as theyTan brought the lieutenant to the edgeof the chasm at a point where onecould see some distance down thestream the sentry panting several rodsbehind The moonlight was faint butstill sufficient to enable him to makeout the form of a man apparently crawling on hands and knees up the bankwhile another lay motionless close tothe waters edge Over this latter Corporal Mahoney was bending imploring ingrief stricken tones Randy wentbounding down the abrupt slope surefooted

from the hospital WhofiredI did sir I hoped to bring downone of the gang but they were too faroff answered the corporal as he waspulling himself up the bankTurning away from the stricken soldier and dabbling for a moment hishand in the stream Randy called to Corcoran tlhe other victim who was groaning and cursing alternately and whopresently burst into maudlin tears demanding to be given a chance to standfup against the d d greasers againthat he might annihilate the entireparty It was evident that a subtlerenemy had downed him even before theMexican took hold He was only slightly injured physically but his moneywas gone All Randy could extractfrom him was that there had been agame and he wouldnt pay up becausethe greasers were cheating and theychased him and Brady and overtookthem and used their knivesBuxton was still up and full of hisproject of sending the patrol of absentees and the band just as soon as theRiflers train should have started Reheard the call for the surgeon

tochange upon discovering- the spotsThis circumstance cost the blamelessbut timid Comte de Remusat his placeas master of the robes The emperorspoiled his clothes so frequently thatthe imperial tailor was constantly receiving fresh orders and 4000 becameinsufficient to meet the bills The master of robes was foolishly afraid to mention the subject to Napoleon and continued to give unsatisfactory replies tothe insistent tailor who became pressing in his demands At length becoming exasperated the tailor took the boldstep of complaining to Napoleon wholearned with astonishment and angerthat he owed his tailor G000 he paidthe bill and at the same time dismissedthe frightened Comte de Remusat Ihope said the emperor -smiling andfrowning at the same time at his newlyappointed master of robes
