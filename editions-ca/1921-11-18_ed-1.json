AND
THE DEADLY AUTOMOBILE
a- W
If anyone has reliable information
as to the menace of automobile
traffic to human life it is the life in
surance companies. Therefore when
the Insurance Press says that "The
automobile has superseded every
form of disease as the- problem of the
day," it is time for Congress and
Legislatures and the public generally
to give the same efforts to control of
motor vehicles that have been de
voted to the warfare against small
pox, tuberculosis and typhoid fever.
Says The Press: "It (the automo
bile, is the greatest controllable, yet
uncontrolled menace of the genera
tion." Massachusetts has a law requiring
drivers of auto vehicles to be licens
ed after examination. Every appli
cant must show working knowledge
of the machine he wants to drive as
well as knowledge of the rules of the
road. Conviction on the charge of
reckless driving means loss of
license. It is claimed that this law,
enacted last year, has reduced the
number' tit auto drivers in the State
1 per cent, and has reduced acci
dents by 50 per cent.
This sounds interesting. Legisla
tors in every State might do well to
investigate the Massachusetts law.
And in the meantime, courts juries
and the people generally should be
moving to secure a stricter enforce
ment Of the traffic laws that wenow
have. I

THE COURTS
Some people are distressed because
of the widespread agitation over the
delays in the administration of jus
tice by the courts. They say it will
tend to destroy confidence in the
courts.
Don't you believe it? The agita
tion that is going on is a healthy
sign.
The courts in this country belong
to the people, and it is the privilege
as well as the duty of the people to
kep watch on them.
The courts are not going to be
abolished, but unless all signs fail
some changes are going to be made
which will make their proceedure
more rapid and certain.
The people are going to see to it
that the courts function for the
speedy administration of justice and
not for the delay or defeat of it, as
has been in the case in so many in
stances in the past.
