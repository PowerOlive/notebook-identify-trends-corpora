There is only one cure for Contagious
Blood Poison the disease which has
completely bfflled the doctors They
are totally unable to cure it and direct
their efforts toward bottling the poison
up in the blood and concealing it from
view S S S cures the disease posi
tively and permanently by forcing out
every trace of the taint
I was afflicted with a terrible blood disease
which was in spots at first but afterwards
spread all over my body
These soon broke out into
sores and it is easy to
imagine the suffering I
endured Before I be
came convinced that the
doctors could do no good
I had spent a hundred
dollars which was really
thrown away I then
tried various patent
medicines but they did
not reach the disease
When I had finished my
first bottle of S S S I
was greatly improved
and was delighted with
The laree red splotches on my
sliest began to grow paler and smaller and
before long disappeared entirely I regained
my lost weight became stronger and my ap
petite greatly improved I was soon entirely
well and my skin as clear as a piece of glass

He leisurely surveyed the depression
into which the ball had disappeared
then in compliance with her mandate
raised his voice in a loud shout The

marking the links line of demarcation
The boy descended slowly from his
point of observation and advanced to
ward the couple The man in the brown
goir suit carae forward to meet him
Look here he said in a low tone
dont you find that ball inside of an
hour Io you hear
A griir of perfect understanding on the
upturn1 freckled face satisfied his in
structor and a bright coin covertly trans
ferred further sealed the compact He
returned t the girls side visibly relieved
Oh sSre said hell never find it
there Just hold my stick while I sbow
