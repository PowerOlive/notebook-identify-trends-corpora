Justice Harlaft Stirs lilt licb.
Justice John M. Harlan hai atirred
be idle ri'.i oc Washington as they
never have ' stirred before by the
sensational u ure read to them by
the great Ke; lucky jurist at tho an
nual banquet of the Presbyterian Al
liance'at War) ington Tuesday night.
"There is no reason for such fla
grant desecrations of God's day as one
sees here in Washington," he said.
' "When the mail carriers deliver
j mail on Sunday they violate the holy
day, and, therefpre, I hope they will
i be stopped and allowed to rest on
j Sunday. Here in Washington you can
I find a transgression of Sunday every
where you look.
"It is a shame that certain people
from New York with big bank rolls
should be allowed to come to Wash
ington and give Sunday dinners and
supper parties when that day should
be devoted to the work of God. I wish
there was some way to stop this un
welcome influx into the capital. It
is an outrage that dinner parties are
given by thee predatory rich per3ons
on Sunday evenings, when they should
be devoted to other and higher things."

Man farmers of Madison county re

sked for more pay to attend a tobacco
crop. Many tenants not only want
h f and everything furniwhed as has
been the custpm, but in addition want
a pr;ce guaranteed not leas than ten
tents when the weed is sold. Other
tenant?, it is clain.ed, want CO per
