Perhaps all precedents were brok
en in receiving of members 'into-an
Epworth League' Chapter ' when '150
applicants were formally recognized
as members of the Somerset Epworth
League Chapter. In January-, Mr.
Dennis V. Snapp, of Paris, President
of the Kentucky Conference Epworth
League, organized the Chapter -with
an enrollment of 20. "Mr. Snapp
again visited the Chapter March 30
and addressed the Chapter, and. over
100 were -in attendance. He -was
very much gratfled to learn that over
150 had signified their intention of
becoming members and he was asked
to return to Somerset, Sunday, April
6, and deliver an address to the. new
members and to assist in formally re
ceiving them into the League. This
is probably the largest Epworth
League Chapter in tiia Kentucky
Conference in point of membership.
The service was a very impressive
one and the main audit6rium of the
church was filled with those, who
were interested in the young people's
work Somerset 'was the first town
Mr. Snapp visited when' he entered x
upon his new work as Field Secretary j
of the Sunday School. . One of tne
lavmen of the Somerset Methodist
church remarked to Mr; Snapp a
