BLUE GRASS GASOLINE gained its popularity by this test because motorists at once recognized its superior quality over the gasoline thatthey had been using. So quickly was the difference in quality noted, thatalmost, overnight more than half of allthe auto and truck owners in Lexington "and vicinity became users and boosters ofBLUE GRASS GASOLINEB.('It is strictly a straight run, highly refined gasoline of superior uniformquality, and is delivered fresR from our refinery to the dealer by competent,experienced men.

D. Clarke, of the fourthgeneration of the pioneer Clarke,thus having been in the possession ofthis -family for over a century thishouse and another that was burnedyears ago having sheltered seven generations of the same name.

GROWERS OF STATELEXINGTON, KY.t Nov., 2 'J. Thatthe tobacco growers of Kentucky willget three times as much money forthe two hundred million pounds ofgood tobacco they have raised thisyear as they will get for the entirecrop of three 'million pounds, if theyfail to "keep the low grades off themarket, was the statement of Congressman J. Campbell Cantrill, himself a large, land owner and tobaccoraiser, on -the eve of his departurefor Washington to prepare for ihecoming session in Congros?Mr. Cantrill has been in Kentuckyfor the past twoweeks, and he haslaevotea some time to personal investigation of the. reports that thetobacco crop is 'much lighter thanlast year's, with the result that hehas come to the conclusion, he said,that not more than tjhree millionpounds "had been grown 'this year, andof this a third is of low grade.Mr. Cantrill urged the necessity oforganization of all the growers, not,only in the Burley Tobacco Growers'Association, of which J. W. Newmanis the head, But in the Farmers'Union, local unions of which are innearly every county. Mr. Cantrill saidit was the 'duty and would be greatlyto the benefit of the farmers tostrengthen their local brganiza'tionshy. joining these farmers' unions, aswell as uniting in a general organization, such as the new association."When I came to Kentucky twoweeks 'ago," said the Congressman,"I will admit that I was' not greatlyencouraged over the outlook forprices this .fall, but after a careful,and painstaking investigation, whichJias included my own tobacco mScott county and some of my neighbors in practically all the big counties of Central Kentucky, I am convinced that the yield this year inweight will not exceed the ability ofthe market to handle, unless the lowgrades should be dumped on themarket, in which case the entire pricefabric will totter. For that reason,it is necessary for the growers td organize to keep this low grade tobacco off the market. The manufacturers and buyers for European tradeare overstocked with that tobacco.lit actually will not pay for the expense of stripping and hauling it, ifdffefed in connection with the better leaf, and can 'only have the effectof demoralizing the, entire market.The growers will suffer no loss, butrather gain largely by holding theselow grades at home."Europe usually takes this tobacco6ff our hands, but just now Europeis not able to pay the interest on herdebts, and since there is no demandfrom that source and American manufacturers are overstocked with thatclass of leaf, it would not pay tostrip and haul that kind of tobacco tomarket. It would be no sacrifice tothe grower to hold it off the marketand redry it. If it is .held off themarket, and held generally, thatmeans that not over two hundredmillion pounds will be marketed andthat the growers will get a good pricefor it, for the manufacturers will nothesitate to buy at good prices if thatamount of tobacco Is offered, forthat amount will be needed by them."If Kentucky has to return at1-anytime in the future to the old scheduleof prices, ft will mean the loss oftheir farms!to many of the growersand the loss of many of the comfortsthat our children in the burley belthave enjoyed for the past eight orten years 'of good prices. I want to(urge all the farmers to get togetherauu slick, wgtner lor tne Deneirc 01themselves and for the benefit of all.They had just as well throw their lowgrade leaf on the ground as to bringit to market. The profit will be aboutthe same. The only way to makesuch a movement to hold off theselow grades a success is to -orga'nizeand for all who are interested in thetobacco growers, business" men andthe press included, to impress" upontne growers, the importance of holding back their low grades until thegood tobacco is marketed if not entirely so far as this year's market isconcerned."The farmers who do market thislow grade leaf are not only their ownenemies but enemies of their neighbors and the tobacco industry. 11they can do by marketing it is tobTeak down the market, which willbe the inevitable result of their offering it. No concerted action to withhold this cheap tobacco is possiblewithout thorough organization. Ifthis organization is effected and ifthe growers will follow the advice oftheir friends good prices will be paidfor what tobacco of the 1920 cron ismarketed."AFTER FIRST DOSE'Tape's 'Cold Compound"Bieaks TJp a Cold 111 aPew Hours.ThenRelief comes instantly.A dosetaKen every two hours untilthrfevxuoco iiis lUKtii usuauy oreaKS jp iSevere cold and ends all the grippemisery.'

At theeleventh-hour, when it was belieyedthat the, new treaty giving" full civilrights to. nationals of Japan practically was complete, obstacles have arisenwhich in all probability not only willprevent it being signed, but will putit in the discard completely, it waslearned officially.Not content with civil rights whichcne atate department had agreed, togrant, the Japanese Government, it isreporcea, smitea its ground and demanded the right of full citizenshipior its nationals.While this drastic change in attitude could not be confirmed officially, it was said by an eminent diplomat that the principle put forth wassuch he did not believe' the - treaty"ever would be, signed by either thisadministration or any other."-It was indicated as highly significant that the hitch in the treatycame immediately after the publication of a dispatch to the Londonuaiiy express from Tokyo, giving thefinal terms to which the JapaneseGoverment had expressed its willingness to agree.I "JHSPP A 1 ' ' is A ) I !r ..
