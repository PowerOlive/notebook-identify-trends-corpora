EmperorWilliams Visit to SpainMatxkid Xov 14 The result of theUnited States elections came as a surprise and disappointment to Sagastawho had confidently expected that therepublicans would at least have loctcontrol of the house of representativesThe Spanish cabinet is convinced thatthe election tipon which it had beencounting1 to obtain better terms atParis have resulted in nothing- thatcan aid Spanish diplomacyThe intended visit of Emperor William in honor of which Adm Camarassquadron is under orders to proceed toCartagena now furnishes anotherstraw to clutch at The queen regentwhose health is visibly impaired bythe strain of the last eight monthsthinks the wisest course to be for thecabinet to instruct the Spanish peacecommissioners frankly to concede theAmerican demand of the Philippinesand to work honestly and expeditiously to frame a treatyNot so however Sagasta who isstill sparring for time and hopes tosucceed in one more gigantic bluffHe now says that the cabinet requiresthe authorization of the cortes beforeit can consent to abandon the Philippines and he is reported to have informed the Spanish commissioners thatthey have no mandate to discuss sucheventualitiesThe marked sympathy for Spain expressed almost unanimously by the German newspapers coupled with the purchase at Perlin and Frankfort of Spanish exterior and Cuban bonds theman holdings of which have beenquadrupled during the last threemonths give an exaggeratedsignificance to the intended visit of the German emperorand empress It is not yet knownwhat the emperors plans may be onhis arrival at Cartagena on November19 but as soon as the llohenzollernreaches that naval station the imperialpair will be invited by an autographletter from the queen regent to visitMadridLord Salisburys reference to theAmerican republic as a factor in Asiaticand possibly Eiiropean diplomacywhich might not conduce to the interests of peace is widely commented upon here as strengthening the prevailing impression that Germans wish tointervene in tho Philippines All butthe extreme Weylerites dread theconsequences of a resumption of hostilities by the United States whichthey are aware would probably involvelthe loss of the Canaries and this inspite of the present German lining tothe cloud remains the irresistible motive that must eventually determinethe cabinet to reconsider the instruction that it is now believed to havesent to the Spanish peace commissionersThe ministry of finance has in handa project for the conversion of thoSpanish exterior bonds and the fundeddebts of Cuba and the Philippines theidea being to maintain the treasuryguarantees of Philippine bonds andCuban bonds of the six and five percent denominations but to reduce thointetest tojtyl and per cent respectively This partially accounts for thefirmness of Cuban bonds in Paris andlierlin where speculation in them isunusually activeMadrid Nov 14 El Imparcialsays the government has

Instead ofthe States The Coast DefensesWork of thu ArsenalsWashington Nov 14 Gen D WFlagler chief of the bureau of ordnance has made his annual report tothe secretary of war It shows thatthere were expended during the fiscalyear ending June 80 189S 71548795and that there still remains ofthe appropriations made for theordnance bureau 1971 359 Thislarge sum is derived from theappropriations for the fiscal yearwhich were made for war purposesamounting to 21504592 Regardingthe equipment of volunteers the general thinks it would be as well as tohave the government equip them instead of their bringing their statearms into service saying that it couldbe done as quickly owing to the condition of the arms of state troopslie speaks in terms of praise in themanner in which work has been performed at arsenals and ordnance factories in the rush that was made inputting the country on a footing forwar with Spain As to the equipmentof an army he saysSo Ions as ihe principal dependence in thiscountry in time or war i in a large volunteerforce newly levied it is impracticable to lvftspon hand large supplies of cavalry artilleryand honc equipment as these in the courseof a few years will not only deteriorate butyill have to be materially modified to keeppace with improvements The major part ofsuch material can by taking advantage of theresources of Rock Inland and the otherareuals and the numerous private establishments capable of producing it be supplied asrapidly as troops can be raised mustered intothe service and piepared Tor campaign Thereshould however be on hand Held and siegeartillery with carriages and a portion of theharness required Tor fJJOJO men Such gunsand carriages can not be turned out in largenumbers until about ix months after initiatingthe workFo equipping an army with a supplyof small arms he thinks there shouldbe a supply of 100000 on hand of aii3rnew arm and the arsenals kept in acondition so as to produce 2500 perdayAn interesting feature of the reportis that which treats of coast defenseThe general saysAttention is especially invited to the experience of the last few months m attempting toprovide quickly a coast defence rt j believedto be impracticable and we will always befovced in any emergency to rely upon whathas been provided in time of pereeI think it fair to state thoughnot in the way of complaint thatthis has been urged upoa congress each yearfor the past ten years The situation is verysimple A plan has been adopted for providing a complete coast defense With the present facilities of the department this work canbe carried on economically and in the most efficient manner in such a way as to completethe present plan in about seven yearsEstimates ought to be submitted eachyear for o much of the work as the facilitiesfor its production will permit it rets withcongress to detennine how much of the noilcan be provided lor each vcar consistentlywith the rcsouices of the country Hutthe work can not faster than tlir appropriations pro ule forIt is probable tliii there mut be addcl tothe plans and estimates loi tho ceat deleavesome provision lor the detente of added possessionsGen Flagler doer not claim for the45 caliber Springfield rifle an equalitywith the new rO caliber magazine titleof the army but says that it is a verygood arm and possesses many meritsThis feature has heretofore been commented upon in discussion of smaiarms used during the war The machinery for the rnaufacture of small armand ammunition was none the best yetthe department turned out 90000000rounds for the war For years past thereport states the appropriations forequipments of infantiy cavalry artillery and horse have been barely sufficient to meet the consumption of theregular army and although there werebuildings there was not machinerywith which to manufacture these suppliesDetails are given of what was doneto rapidly increase the coast defenseswhen tin war began lie calls attention to the fact ihat congress hasnever appropriated what was askedfor powder and projectiles and in consequence the supply at the beginningof the war was inadequate and hegives some instances of the work doneby the department to

nowAye murmured Grafton but whatwill the waking be if theres no Florence here to morrowThat was an anxious night at Sedgwick Merriam slept like the dead andtwice the young doctor feared it mightbe necessary to rouse him thinkingthat perhaps he had sent that tiny shotof his hypodermic syringe with tooheavy a charge But so long as Randywas ignorant of his wifes mad escapade he would have slept through sheerexhaustion and weariness and his physician need not have troubled himselfTwice Grafton tiptoed in and the hospital attendant arose at his coming andreported that the patient had notstirredOver at Graftons quarters howeverthey had to deal with a less tractablecreature Fanny McLane had rousedfrom her swoon and was nervously excitably irritably wide awake demanding actually to be allowed to seeMr Merriam Even Annette was sentout of the room and Mrs Grafton hadher friend and guest to herself and hertears and prayers her reproaches andimprecations fell on hardened earsMrs

die she cried and carry myone safeguard with him to the graveSorely puzzled Mrs Grafton had toleave her once in awhile for a few minutes at a time to consult her husbandwho could frequently be heard movingabout the parlor or going quickly inand out of the house It was plain thatGrafton was troubled about somethingbesides Randy and at 11 oclock the explanation cameUp to sundown Florence Mrs Merriam had not been seen or heard of atJoses ranchOne of the trailers Raff erty by namedeclared that Mignons tracks turnedsuddenly to the northward and led awayfrom the ranch and into the maze offoothills to the right of the cantonmenttrail At sundown they had reachedJoses still hoping against hope thatshe would be there but no sign 01 herhad been seen and borrowing a freshhorse Rafferty started back to Sedgwick at the gallop to carr the news Hemet the doctor with Mrs Hayne onlya short distance from Joses and theywcnt on to the ranch hoping for bettertidings but bade him ride for Sedgwick with all speed Rafferty couldride week in and week out if the horsecould stand it and Joses broncho wasa used up quadruped by the time theyreached the Santa Clara There heturned him into a ranchmans corraland borrowed another never stoppingto say by your leave sir This wason the queens service in Raffertysmind and no mans property was sacredwhen Miss Florences life was involved Buxton was up and about whenthe courier came and in ten minuteshad reached the office and sent forGrafton What he wished to know washad she any reason whatever for turning away from the beaten track andtaking to the unknown regions off theroad and far to the northwest of thesettlements Grafton knew of noneThere was indeed grave reason why sheshould notFor 50 miles northward the SantaClara twined and twisted through afairlj fertile valley once the herdingground of the Navajos now wild and almost unsettled Americans and Mexicans both had tried it as a stock rangebut American cattle and Americanhorses demanded a better quality ofgrass and more of it than would servethe stomach of the Indian pony Treatyobligations sent the Navajos fartherinto the mountains to the northwestbeyond the Mescalero but there wererestless roamers who were constantlyoff the reservation sometimes on passbut oftener on mischief and on the pretext of trading they came recklessly asfar as the settlement and then somebodys horses were sure to be missingspirited away into the foothills whitherit was almost useless to follow TheNavajos said the Mexican were thethieves the Mexicans declared them tobe the Navajos and when both partieswere caught and accused with promptunanimity both announced thatApaches must again be raiding and thename of Apache covered a multitudeof sins Time was when Victorio andNana led the cavalry some gloriouschases into the Mescalero but boththose redoubtables had met their fateand agency officials across the Arizonaline were ready to swear that none oftheir once intractable followers everthought of quitting corn or melonplanting for the forbidden joys of theraid and the warpath All the same thefoothills and the valley far to the northwest of the settlements were full ofmystery and danger the roamingground of the horsethief and the renegade and Merriams men just in fromtheir long chase pointed out how theMexican ruffians though startingoriginally toward the southwest hadin long wide circuit gradually workedtheir way northward as though makingfor this very region The leader of thegang that shot Brady and Corcoran wasa fellow by the name of Ramon Valdezand there was no deviltry too steep forhim The news therefore that Florence Merriam had not reached Josesbut that her trail was lost somewhereamong the buttes and bowlders fourmiles tc the eastward of that frontierrefuge struck dismay to the hearts ofher friends at Sedgwick The tidingswent from lip to lip from house tohouse like wildfire and by midnightan entire troop had ridden forth withtheir ever ready three days rationsand with Capt George Grafton in command and their orders were not to return without Mrs Merriam or definitenews of herMrs Grafton let her husband go onlywith deep reluctance He was very necessary to her now She felt the need ofhis support in the management of hertruculent patient She had to leave thelatter while assisting him in his busypreparations and she was surprisedand rejoiced to see that on her returnto her Fanny had become far more calmand resigned The ladies in manvhouseholds were still up and flittingabout the post tearfully forebodinglydiscussing the situation and several ofthem had dropped in to speak a wordwith Mrs Grafton Whittaker andMinturn being ever on the alert to escort such parties and so it was longafter one indeed it was nearly twooclock when at last after a final peepat her now placidly sleeping guest andleaving Annette curled up on the sofaby her mistress bedside Mrs Graftonfinally sought her own pillow and sleptlong into the sunshine of the followingdayAwakening with a start at the soundof stirring music on the parade shefound that it was after eight and guardmounting was in full blast Summoning a servant her first question was fornews of Mrs Merriam for servants always know the garrison news beforetheir masters Not a word had been received Presently she tiptoed to Fannys room softly turned the knob andnoiselessly entered There lay her gueststill plunged in deep slumber but Annette had disappeared gone probablyto the kitchen for coffee Far over atthe east where the railway crossed thebarren mesa a locomotive whistle brokethe silence of the desert with long exultant blast The blockade then wasbroken The first train was coming infrom Cimarron Dressing with greaterhaste than usual she ordered breakfastserved and then went out on the piazzaand looked up the row toward the Merriams The doctor was just comingout of the gate and Whittaker who hadspent the night there on watch allthought of rivalry forgotten wasstanding on the top step apparentlydetaining the physician with some question Eager for news of Randy MrsGrafton threw her husbands cavalrycape over her shoulders and trippedbriskly up the gravel walk Still sleeping said the doctor and how is yourpatientAlso sleeping said Mrs GraftonI dont see how people can sleep sosoundly at such times whereat thedoctor looked conscious but said nothingAll that morning people strained theireyes and rubbed their binoculars andsearched the distant foothills to thenorthwest hoping for the coming ofcouriers with news but not until afternoon were they rewarded Then covered with sweat and dust a corporal ofGraftons troop rode in Dr Gould andMrs Hayne were still at Joses thoughthey feared they could be of no usethere for not a sign of Florence had beenfound Grafton had sent couriers on tothe Catamount with the tidings of herperil and his men in wide dispersedorder were scouring the foothills longdajs marches awaj Full half an hourthe ladies grouped at Buxtons listening to the soldiers description of theirsearch and then were strolling homeward when over toward the west end ofthe cavalry line arose the sound of commotion and distressAn instant later as the doctorglancing turned to hasten thither awoman dressed in deepest black camereeling forth from the Merriams doorway and plunging wildly down thesteps Everyone knew her at a glanceit was Fanny McLane who stood therenow swaying at the gate as thoughgasping for breath while calling inarticulately for aid It was but a few seconds before the doctor reached her1 told him his wife was goneThey saw him accost her briefly then gospringing past her up the steps andinto the house A moment more andMrs Grafton with other womenreached herWhat is the matter What has happened Fanny Why are you hereAnd cowering sobbing shivering shemade answerOh stop him save him Hell killhimself I told him his wife wasgoneToo late Out to the stable the doctor

starting hadtaken the responsibility of removingFlorences ominous looking missive andplacing it with other letters on themantel in the little parlor He couldnot feel justified in hiding it entirelyHe felt that when Merriam woke thetruth would have to be told him andperhaps Florences own words mightbest explain her flight At all eventsDr Leavitt had promised to be onhand to see that the news was

theUnited States army was made publicThursday by direction of SecretaryAlger The keynote of the report isfound in one of the opening sentenceswhere it is said The military operations during the year have been extraordinary unusual and extensive astatement which is fully borne out bythe long recital of important eventsVhich Gen Miles shows have made themilitary history of the year 189S thamost remarkable since the end of thecivil warIn point of interest the documentdivides naturally into four chaptersfor while brief allusion is made to suclmatters as the military expeditions toAlaska interest naturally centers inthe portion which treats of the warwith SpainUnder this general- head the reportdeals with the plans of campaign oithe war preparations with the Santiago campaign with Gen Miles operations in Porto Itico and lastlywith the important changes inexisting organizations which arein Gen Miles opinion necessaryto make the army an effectiveweapon for the defense of the countiyThere is an entire absence of an evidence of direct criticism though certainsentences iu the report are italicisedin an apparent desire to justify previously expressed plans of details ofthe campaigns and where it dealwith events the document is largelymade up of a quotation of official dispatchesTreating of the war Gen Miles begins with a statement of the unprcparedncss of the country show ing howthe vast equipment left by the millionsoldiers of the civil war had been dissipated or had become obsolete untithe tentage or transportation anccamp equipage was insufficient for anyimportant military operation He recounts the legislation of congress justprior to the war looking to the increase of the army and cites hisown recommendation on April thai40000 men be provided for coast defense and veserve that the regulararmy be increased and 10000 imrauncsrecruited making a force of 10259men which with 50000 native auxiliaries he considered sufficient Such aforce properly

has caused suit tobe filed aaiu t the Paris banks to collect certain taxes which the Council alleges the banks owe the city but whichibe bauks claim t ey do not oweThe News has abstained from allcomments upon the controversy be-tween the Council and the bauks because it hoped that moderation and con-srvatism would govern the Council inits dealing with the question aud that anamicable stttlement satisfactory to allparties would be reached without anpeal to the courtsNearly all of the cities in CentralKentucky have settled with their bankson substantially the same terms as thosenamed in the proposition of the Parisbanks to the City CouncilTHE News is confident that there isespecially am mg the business men andtax payers of the City who have agreater interest in UlG lUn than anyothers no disposition to persecute thebanks or to deal harshly or unfairlywith thfim The most that any fairman does or could n quire is that theyhfi taxed the same as individuals are jtaXpd no more and no less and thatfor such years as they have paid all thetaxes that could be required of them under the law as then interpreted by thehighest court in the State they have aright to claim exemption from the payment of other taxes which during thoseyears could not be collected from themby lawAs we understand it the position ofthe banks in the controversy is brieflythisBefore the adoption of the new Constitution they paid tax under what wasknown as the Hewitt Law which required them to pay into the State Treasury seventy five cents on each share ofstock of the par value of one hundreddollars besides a certain tax on the surplus and this was all the tax they hadto pay The Hewitt Law was understood by the state by the banks and bythe general public to be a contractwhich should last as long as the bankscontinued to do business under thecharters they had when the law wasenacted But after the adoption of thenew constitution the question as towhether the banks should continue topay tax under the Hewitt Faw or berequired to pay under the tif w law finwhich event they wonld be subject toCity and County as well as State taxeswas taken into the courts and was decided by the Court of Appeals in June1895 in a decision rendered by JudgePryor iu which that court held theHewitt Law to be an irrevocable contract and that banks must pny taxes asrequired by that law as long as tht ycontinued to do business rnder tuecharters held by them at the timeHewitt Law was enacted Beforedecision was rendered the bankspaid taxes to the State under thelaw under protest at the rate fcents on each one hundredthethishadnew42lars of assets for the years1893 and 1894 After the decision theState authoritiej demanded aud thebanks were required to pay the difference between the 42J cents which theState had collected and the 75 cents oneach share which the court had decidedthey must pay for the years 1893 and1894 Afterwards while this decisionwas still in force the banks paid as required by that decision all taxes duefrom them for the years 1895 and 1896A subsequent decision of the same courtpractically reversing the Pryor decisionwas rendered by Judge Paynter inApril 1897 Under this last decisionfrom which an appeal has been taken tothe Supreme Court of the United Statesit was held that the banks will be required to pay tax under the new lawBefore this decision was renderedhowever and while the first decisionwas still in force as the interpretation ofthe law by the highest Court iu the Statethe banks paid all the tax wnich theyowed for the years 1893 1894 1895 and1896 They had thus performed everyobligation that could be r quired ofthem under the law governing theirtaxation and had done so relying uponthe validity and authority of a decisionof the Court of Appeals of Kentuckyprescribing and defining their duties inthe matter of paying taxes Certainlythey hid a right to rely upon this decision and should be protected fromharm or loss by reason of such relianceWe are informed that for the fouryears 18934 5 and 6 the banks of Parispaid into the State Treasury nearly14 00000 in excess of what they wouldhive had to pay but for that decisionand that the banks of Kentucky paidmore than half a million dollars and 1not a cent of all this large sum can berecoveredAs to the technical points of law involved in the case The News being nolawyer and having no knowledge onthat subject will not attempt to discussthem but the equities of the ca e infavor of the banks are so strong that noteven the concurrent decisions of all theCourts of Kentucky holding them liab efor further taxes for the years namedcould override the convictions of fairmen who understand the facts that thebanks have paid all for those years thatcan be rightfully demanded of themIn other cities these equities have appealed so strongly to the authorities thatWBHWMiPlwlHPpatisfactory settlements have been easilyeffectedWe hope the City of Paris do notwish to be harder or more grasping thanany other city in the State and that itmay not be too htte even yet for a settlement to be made which will be fair tothe banks and satisfactory at the sametime to the tax payersDr Adairs Dental

are among department clerksfrom this trouble The thing seems togrow among them aud they have theirheadaches as regularly as they havetheir workA simple remedy which is worth trying is to put a rubber baud around thehead just above the ears The bandshould not be tight enough to stop thecirculation of the blood The bandknown as the string band is generallysufficiently heavy for the purpose Itshould be applied just as soon as it isnoticed that the headache is setting iuand taken off the moment the painceasee In many cases the rubber bandworks nicely though it affords no relief when the headache is the result ofstomach troubles or biliousnessI find also that a rubber band twisted about a toe between the corn aud thefoot is a handy remedy to stop tho painfrom a jumping com Corns are veryliable to bo troublesome when there ismuch humidity in the atmosphere Therubber band seems to temporarily quietthe nerves in the toe and in this waystop the pain As in the case of a bandaround the head the pressure should notbe tight enough to stop the circulationof the blood Washington StarA rgelnnlcr WitAs Hansen wrb Germanys greatestmaster in mathematical astronomy sowas the venerable Argelauder in

ami That during theCraeeo Turkish war several years agoin the height of a hVree conflict madethe discovery that he was actuallyshrieking aloud the Mendelssohnspring Song which had been dominant in his brain from the first chargeThis is nervousness I suppose People whose tastes are strongly musicalinvariably have a tune in their mindswhen under strong excitement of anykindYe were talking on this subject notlong ago and some one asked Mr Alfred Jlobyn V jie had ever experiencedanything similar to Creelmans humming the Spring SongThere is one occasion when I didand I shall never forget either the circumstance or the tune It happenedin my student days when I used to practice almost eery evening on one of thechurch organs of town without anypimping you know just pedal workthat made no noise One night late inthe fall I sat on the high organ benchworking away with one gas jet flainngabove my head and not another lightin the church which was old andgloomy as could be-This is a ghost story by the wayyou ought o know that before I getany farther a ghost story that has atrue endingI had come in that evening bv wavof the Sunday school room which wasjust back o the auditorium and separated from it by a large double doorThis door or half of it I had left openus was my usual customAs I finished a set oC exercises I unconsciously turned around on my seathalf making up 1113 mind to shut theorgan and go home as twas after nineGlancing in the direction ofthe double door I saw that it wasclosedThis ws a surprise ITow cameUnit door shut was the question thatflashed through my brain in an instantp nd then I began casting about for areasonable excuseThe draft No there was none asI had closed and ocked the outsidedoor when entering- the churchA defective hinge that would swingto Impossible for I well rememberedthat this same door would never closeof itself having- invariably to be openedwith much exertion owing to thickness of the carpet about the door Astrong shove was always necessary inorder to get it openThere was but one thing left withinthe bounds of reason leaving out ofcourse supernatural means which Iscoffed at The door had been closed-by some person who was then in theSunday school room and who wasthere for no honest purposeWell the only thing to do -was toinvestigate so sliding off the bench Ileft the gas burning and started downthe aisle toward the doorImmediately and unconsciously Tbegan to whistle and what do you supibse the tune was That old balladWhen You and I Were Young- Maggiewhich I ncverliad any fondness for andso cant imagine how in the world itcame into my mind But it certainly-was there and I finished two or threebars in the liveliest manner beforexeaching the doorBefore I put my hand on the knobJ rather braced myself half expecting- that there might be opposition on theother side but the door opened as easily as It ever did and I walked into thoSunday school room still whistling myand peering- about in the dimflight I had no malones so could notiigY the gas jetI stood for a frv seconds in therTlrWWl- lijMWIiilMmiddle of the room trying- to make cmobjects of just what sort I was notquite certain but firmly convinced thaithere was some person in the room beside mvself I could not see them 07him I could hear no one breathe 1just felt that there was another livingbeing in that room and the feeling wasnot one conducive Jo entire equanimity on my part eitherBut I continued to whistle oh dearyes and I think I went through thatsillv ballad tune twice while I stoodand like Micawber waited for something to turn up Nothing turned andmy hair finally regained its normalposition on my headThen walking boldly through theroom I stepped out at the front doorunlocked it and down the steps 1 thsidewalk winding up the chorus olMaggie with a flourishAnd then and then only did 1realize that I had been whistling thetune at allWalking up the street in the direction of my car I thought over the affair and the more I thought the moreconvinced was I that somebody waahidden away in that Sunday schoolroomIf it is a tramp and he stays thereall night and sets the church on firemy conscience will prick me foreverafterward was my final conclusionClearly it was my duty to find the policeman on this beat and go back to thechurchBut concluding to find a policemanand then findinghim are two totally different propositions as you may haveheard before After hunting about tenminutes or so it was raining too bythis time coming down hard I gaveup the struggle and resolved to goback aloneIf there is no one there then Illjust prove to myself that Ive been imaginative and nervous and thats wiatIm beginning to think anyhow Soback I wentUnlocking the church door Istepped in and on to the Sundayschool room It was darker than everliterally could not see a rod aheadof me coming in and out of thestreet light and ts you know I hadnot a single matchI walked across the room to thepiano where I had left a roll of musicthat was my excuse to myself forgoing back you know and as I turnedto leave by the same route I made outthe form of a man leaning against thewall with a club raised in his righthand He was about a dozen yardsahead of me on my way to the doorAnd this is the point where I foundthat I could not whistle I was stillthinking of Maggie and my brainwas forming the tome all right but byiJiiiff iii Jr - I 1 nr 1 T rt m r i - n rr -1 i i iV3r JVg jf w Nry -I MADE OUT THE FORM OF A MANJove I could not whistle that tune tosave my neck and you will admit thatsaid neck needed saving right at thismomentThen I began to think how I wasto get past the fellqw if there reallywas a man over by tne wall You seeVI was more than half convinced thatmy nerves and imagination were atwork agaiu I determined on a detouraround the other side of the pianoand stepping along briskly with justas unconscious an air as I could muster passed behind the piano andaround by the door The man nevermoved from his position bv the walland I got out safely with the conviction that trying to prove a thing toones self isnt always a wise thingto do as I had only succeeded in rendering my nerves all the more erraticby my second visitI reached home and turned in forthe nightNext morning I had hardly finishedbreakfast when the doorbell rang furiously and the senior warden of thechurch was ushered inWere you at the church last nightKobynV he said much excited andwithout waiting for 1113- answer wenton to tell me that thieves had brokenin stolen the entire new carpet of theSunday school room the communionservice all the cushions they couldlay their hands on part of the libraryand in short pretty much everythingof valueThey were undoubtedly there during my stay in the church and it ismighty lucky for me that they didntbrain me when I passed the fellow inthe Sunday bchool room But he evidently felt secure in the fact that Icould see hardly at all and had I madeany motion that would have betrayedmyself or the fact that I did see himit would have been all up with meBut whistling is a great comfortthere s no doubt about it youwant to make sure that your whistlewill work well

BrahmraWho Is the Worker of Seeming MiraclesThe following extraordinary narration of facts as they occurred andwhich we are informed were witnessed and can be testified to by themembers of three households- occupying a large house in Bentinck streetCalcutta are so remarkable that it isworth the while of any scientist to testthem personally as this can be easilydone on the occasion of any theft bydomestics in the house It may beadded that every servant in CalcuttaIs a lively believer in its efficacy and ifa thief at- once confesses A BrahminIs the worker of these marvels He iswell known in Calcutta and does notprofess to work out his method oftheft detection for money but leavesit to those who employ him to rewardhim if they think fit It is said thatthis is readily done and that he makes3 good thing out of itA man in the service of a family inthe locality alluded to intrusted hisnephew with a large sum of money tokeep in deposit The nephew allegedthat he placed the money in an earthen pot which he buried The locationof the exact spot was confided to afriend Shortly after this the cookwas informed by his nephew that thepot and money bad disappeared Withthe nephews consent the Brahmin wassummoned to discover the thief andthe following is a bare narration of theextraordinary procedure he adoptedand usually adopts in all such casesAccompanied by an aid he comes tothe house provided with two bamboorods about 16 feet long and an inchand a half in diameter He also haswith him a number of fresh peepulleaves cocoanut some rice and somevermilion and cowries A fresh earthen dish has to be provided by theperson who summons him as well as astoolAll the servants in the house aresummoned They are made to standin a half circle and their names arewritten on each leaf and these leaveswith one painted with the vermilionare placed in the dish which in itsturn- is placed on the stool Two utterstrangers are then made to hold thebamboo rods one in each hand opposite each other with their elbows farbehind their hips so that they canhave little or no influence in turningor bending the rods Now comes thestrange part of the proceedings Atthe Brahmins call of each name thebamboo rods in the first instance risetogether and form a semicircle aboveThen they bend and forming a semicircle below gradually come together pick up the leaf containing thename called out and throw it out ofthe dish This strange process is repeated till the name of the thief asalleged is called when they both seizethe leaf lift it up and only disengageat the call of the Brahmin who entreats the rods to let the leaf go Toall appearances the two men who holdthe rods make no effort whatever -Thething is done in such an extraordinary fashion as to exceed belief In fact a reasonable human being cannot believe it till he has witnessed it and when he has done so hisamazement is all the greater Hereis indeed a marvel for the scientistto puzzle over The two rods bendcome together and seize upon theright names as they are called outand then throw them aside except inthe case of the thief In this case thenephew confessed to the theft and anumber of his relatives who had comefrom up
