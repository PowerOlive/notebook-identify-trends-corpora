BACON BUYS' FINE LLAtiD v
,' ' NEABcSALCMr ALABAMA.
'
"a dispatch, from Washington, C. H.,
Ohio, to the Cincinnati Enquirer' yes
terday said "Warren A. Bacon, the
horseman, who came to this city a
year ago from Paris, Ky., bringing
with him a fine string of standard
bred horses, several of which, have.
made great records on the turf the
past season, has just purchased 500
acres of land 40 miles from Salem,
Ala. The plantation is one of the
most desirable in that part of the
country, and Mr. Bacon will move, to
it the first of next March. In connec
tion with keeping up a racing stable
he will operate the land, it being a
fine alfalfa country. He took over the
entire equipment, including the fore
man! and the negroes, who have' for
years been working on the planta
tion. When looking over the planta
tion last weekwith a view of buying
Mr. Bacon followed the Southern cus
tom and filled his pocket with dimes
.and nickles which he scattered among
the negroes in the cabinq on
the place, making them feel happy.
"Mr. Bacon has decided to sell all
the trotters he owns at the present
time, including Peter Billikin
(2:104), the stallion for which the
'Russian Government recently offered
$10,000, the offer being refused. He
will also sell the well-known "sire,
Wiggins (2:19), sire,, of the ex
champion of Europe, Wig Wag; La
conda (2:02), the pacing stallion. In
his sale will be included 15 colts and
brood mares.
"Mr. Bacon's many friends in Ohio
and Kentucky will regret to see him
go so far away."
. Several .weeks ago Mr. and Mrs.
Bkconrwere here on a visit to rela
tives and en route South where Mr.
Bacon expected to locate permanent-ty.
PARIS BOY THOUGHT TO HAVE
BEEN KILLED IN ACCIDENT.
The appearance of press dispatch
in the Cincinnati Enquirer of Tuesday
caused much apprehension among
the relatives of James Moran in this
city. A young man by the same
na,me met death under the wheels of
a train near Dayton, O., Sunday and
upon seeing the dispatch from Day-
i ton immediately began to investigate.
His brother, Mr. John Moran, and sis
ter, Mrs. James Craven, sent a number
of dispatches to the authorities at
Dayton, and after an investigation
it was determined the yictim of the
accident was not the son of Thomas
Moran, formerly of Pari3. T wa
His Great Mistake.
The man who wants all the best of
every bargain cheats himself of fu
ture opportunities.
The Sole of Milan states that prac
tically all obstacles have been over
ome and that the concession will
presently be granted for ttie Italian
section of the proposed international
railway from Locarno to Pallanza,
via Cannobla nd Intr. The line will
be of great importance, as it Avill pass
through country where industry and
commerce are in a flourishing state,
and it will also serve "as a direct link
with the Simplon.

A
TELLS OF TEA LEGEND.
"Tea drinkers should remember' the
legendary origin of the tea plant,"
says a writer. "Darhuma, a Buddhist
priest, son o a king, retired to Lo
Yzng in order to pass five years in
prayer and meditation.
"Like St. Anthony, he was tempted
and eventually he "fell asleep during
his lone hours of meditation. On
awakening he cut off his offending
eyelids that his eyes might never
close again, and immediately flung
them to the ground, where they were
immediately transformed into the
first tea plant. ".
"It was for this reason believed
that tea was a beverage sent from
Heaven to repel slumber and enable
good Buddhist priests to keep their
vigils."
