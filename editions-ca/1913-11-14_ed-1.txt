Gas & Electric Co., last night at the regularmeeting of the City Council, throughits president, Mr. W. A. Smith, of theLight & Development Co., of St. Louis, pledged itself to operate under thefranchise granted the Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co., which waspurchased by the owners of the localconcern, t and the consumers in thiscity can nov rest assured of thirtyfive cent gas.Without an exception all the questions brought up at the meeting ofthe Board, which had previously beencalled to the attention of the head ofthe Light &N Development Co., wereadjusted amicably, and the attitude Iof Mr. Smith indicated that the company intended to act in good faith re-I gar ding the furnishing of natural gasunuer uie new irancnise.An ordinance which in substanceprovided for the retention of the oldfranchise now held by the companyto protect itself in the event of thesupply of natural gas being exhausted, and to safeguard the consumersof natural gas from any infringementon the part of the operating company,was introduced by Councilman W. O.Hinton, and was passed by the unanimous vote of the Board.Aside from Mr . Smith, the gascompany was represented by Hon. C.M. Thomas, who in a short talk before the Council stated the purposeof his clients was to act in the best offaith toward the people of Paris, andwas ready and willing to .meet any demands made upon it, regardless ofthe conditions, that would assure thepeople fair dealing in the matter ofdistributing natural gas. He saidfurther that the old franchise whichwas granted in 1910 was a part of theassets of the Light & DevelopmentCo., and its annulment would deprivethe company of a portion of the basis upon which it secured 'immenseloans to conduct its business in thisand other cities, and asked that thecity allcw the old franchise to remainin force.Mr. Smith stated that his companywas morally obligated to live up tothe provisions of the franchise purchased from the Central KentuckyNatural Gas Company, and the onlyreason the Council was asked to allowthe old franchise to continue in existence was to demonstrate a fairnesstoward the people who had financedthe IocpI proposition. He furtherstated that the provisions of the ordinance introduced before the Boardwas entirely satisfactory to him andthat before it became effective hewould have all agreements reduced towriting, properly signed and placedin the hands of the officials.Regarding the deposit required ofconsumers Mr. Smith declined to enter into any agreement that was notcalculated to protect the company,but instead of the $10 deposit whichwas required under the contract heagreed to reduce the amount to thecost of the proportionate amount ofgas used by a consumer in six weeks,the limit of time extended to consunxers without having their gas supplycut off. The consumer of questionable credit it was agreed should berequired to make a deposit sufficientto secure the ?as comnanv from nns-Jsible loss, but this, however, does notj apply to property owners or thosewho secure the signatures of property owners to contracts.As it was stated several days agothat Mr. H. W. Beck, secretary of theLight & Development Co., of St. Louis, had madevthe assertion to MayorHinton that the company intended tooperate under the old franchise, thematter was brought to the attentionof the Council for immediate consideration, and a special meeting wascalled to take action. This, however,was postponed at the solicitation ofMr. Beck, who returned to St. Louis,Mr. Smith coming to Paris to appearbefore the Council last night Thefor,mer, according to the president ofthe company, made the statementwithout authority, and not until ameeting of the directors of the company was held in St. Louis few daysago were any of the details taken upfor consideration, and that the existing conditions had not been broughtto the notice of the officials of thecompany in St. Louis until apprised ofthem by iocal officials of the companyand through newspaper accounts.The passage of the ordinance by theCouncil1 last night does not in a legalsense, it is said, affect the old franchise held by the company, but relieves the situation, fchich has forseveral weeks been strained to thepoint of breaking, through the agreement of the company to furnish natural Agas at the rate specified in thefranchise whichwas-purchased fromthe Central Kentucky Natural GaseMFanr. - w" 7.1 fcNov. 15th is the time ,and while you are look-ing forward t this date remember that thisstore is headquarters for all kinds of hunting, clothes Dux Bak Water Proof Coats and-J Pants, the kind that brars can't tear up andthat water won't go through Shell Vest andDux Bak Hunting Caps and Hats and theWitch Elk Hunting Shoes in different lengthsand kinds, 6 to 1 5 inches.

Lambert's romance of thenew West, "The Girl and the Stampede," is a, play founded on the lifeencountered upon the frontier in theearly days of strife with the invadersof Montana. The author has endeavored to picture in . true manner thescenes and incidents just as encountered and experienced by those whobraved the storm and hardships ofthe early life in the days that the playdemonstrates. The piece comes tothis, city with the very highest of endorsements as to its worth and tromauthentis reports of the various ciiesof the East where the mostsuccessfulruns have been made that "The Girland the Stampede" opens up a newchance for thought and admirationfor the great newWest. "The Girland the Stampede" will be seen atthe Paris Grand, Saturday, Nov. 15,with the original New York castNandspecial scenery.(adv)"Mutt and Jeff.""Mutt and Jeff" and their entirefamily of fun makers, singers anddancers come to the Paris Grand foran engagement of one night, Thursday, November 20. "Mutt and Jeff"holds the record as the most successful cartoon play in theatrical history.Not alone that, but it is acknowledgedthe financial success of the season,which means practically the most meritorius musical production of the year.The critics have said it, the people aresaying it all over the country. Boxpffice records prove it. To have created such a furore "Mutt and Jeff"must be worthy of your patronage aswell as it was of the patronage of others who laud it to the skies. It is amusical comedy on entirely new andunique lines, full of fun and good music, introducing those two inimitablecharacter creations of Bud Fisher'sgenius with the pencil. The play wasconstructed for laughing purposesonly and in that it has been eminentlysuccessful. From the first appearance ot Mutt ana Jen: until thefinal fall of the curtain, laughter is incessant; except when some one isshrieking in excess of merriment.When you go to see "Mutt and Jeff"place your. dignity on the seat and sitdown on it. You are going to laughwithout regard for dignified demeanoror regardless of what anyone is thinking of you. Probably you'll make a"darned fool" of yourself, but don'tyoucare, as all the others are doingthe same thing and they won't havetime to notice you. You've "undoubtedly enough trouble of your own inevery-day life, so forget it all andmake friends with "Mutt and Jeff."It brings a car load of magnificentscenery and a Pullman car full of"beauty," that- is to say, femininebeauty. No play is really worth whilewithout a beavy of prettfy girls andthis "bevy", is more than pretty.Don't fail to get in line early onTuesday morning.
