The second day of the Bourbon Fairwas marked by one of the best exhib-!its seen on the grounds of the BourbonCounty Agricultural Society in many (years. There was a very noticeablefalling off in the attendance, due in a !great measure to the Camden barbe-1cue held near Versailles.The stock exhibit yesterday was ;said by many who have been attend-;ing the fair for years, to have been ofthe very highest order and competent 'judges were of the opinion that the .competition could not have been greater in the majority of the rings shown 'during the day.The weather was ideal for the exhibition, altohugh a threatening cloudwhich made its appearance late in theafternoon, caused a bit of uneasiness ,for fear of a heavy rain, but the result was only a slight cooling of theatmosphere, which added to the comfort of those in attendance, I,Aside from the stock exhibit thebaby show under the auspices of the ;Babies' Health League, was the cen-.ter of attraction. Only the babies ad-imitted to the honor roll by making a;score of 90 per cent, or better wereshown for the prizes offered in theClass A of the exhibit. The first prize Jwas won by James E. Clay, son of Mr.and Mrs. Samuel Clay, of Bourbon,who made a score of 95 points, whileMargaret McCray, daughter of Mr. andMrs. Tom McCray, of North Middletown, and Mary Elizabeth Hughes,daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Hughesof Paris, tied for the second prize,each attaining an average of 90.Others of the honor roll babjes entitled to participate were Robert Talbott Gaitskill, son of Mr. and Mrs.Virgil Gaitskill, of Austerlitz, average94; Robert Baker, son of Mr. andMrs. Granville Baker, Bourbon county, average 90; William TalbottBaldwin, son of Mr; and Mrs. GroverBaldwin, average 90.

This information was secured on high authority Wednesday and next week it isexpected the department will give outa list of banks in Kentucky which areto receive the money and the a,mountto be deposited in each.During the recent conference ofbankers Louisville's committee askedfor $2,500,000. About half of the $3,000,000 askked for is to be allotted. Itis understood that Louisville's depositwill compare favorably with that ofother cities of larger size and in anequally strategic position in respect tocrop movement.The money will be sent to the Louisville, Lexington and other banks ofthe South and West as soon as theyhave deposited their security. It isprobable the names of the banks selected as depositaries will not be madepublic until the money is on its way tothem. A committee, one member ofwhich will be a citizen usually aState banker representing the Government, will pass on the collateraloffered as security for the Governmentdeposits by the banks in each city.FAIR VISITORS.Beautiful Fall stock of ready-to-wearhats just received from the East nowready for your inspection.(X) MRS.

LENIHAN.WASHINGTON RELIEVEDREGARDING MEXICO.The Mexican situation is far lessthreatening than it was 24 hours ago.The press reports which came inabout 12 o'clock last night from Mexico City, to the effect that PresidenHuerta had demanded immediate recognition from the United States on thepenalty of rupturing diplomatic relations, lack official confirmation.In fact Secretary of State Bryan received a dispatch from NelsonO'Shaughnessy, Secretary of theAmerican Embassy, at 4 o'clock thismorning declaring that no such ultimatum had been delivered. Thiscontradiction of the press dispatchesbrought a feling of great relief to Administration circles, inasmuch as theState Department had been benraisedof the character of the press reportsfrom the Mexican capital as soon asthey had been received last night.The unanimity of all the dispatchesfrom American correspondents inMexico City with respect to the deliverance of an ultimatum is inexplicable. The representatives, of f the leading press associations and newspaperscabled substantially the same generalreport that President Huerta hadthreatened to serve dipolmatic relations with the United States unlessrecognition was extended to him by12 o'clock last night.The assumption here is that word tothis effect had been passed out tothem from the Mexican Foreign Office,who made the announcement thatSpecial Envoy John Lind would not bereceived by the Mexican Governmentunless he bore credentials and notice ofthe recognition of President Huerta.Any way, the fact remains that thisGovernment has received no such ultimatum.A Russian scientist claims to havediscovered an inoculation for useagainst forest insects.There are nearly six thousand professional foresters in Germany whoare associated with various technicalsocieties.The University of Washington hassecured the use of two sections ofland on the Snoqualmie National forest in connection with its forestrycourses.A tool used to fight fires on theCalifornia forests combines a rake,spade and hoe.
