The road is short to anything we
fear. Men never fear success.
Do you know that anger is never
without a reason. But it's always
a poor one!
How is it that a fellow with lota
of money can be a bad egg, but no
one objects until he is broke?
The thing3 which hurt should
teach us a lesson.
Every day men are taken by bur
prise and the nap of the neck and

THE .FBIENDSHIP OF BOOKS
Fenelon once said that if all the
crowns of Eurpce were offered him
on condition that he vould no long
er read books, he would spurn the
crowns.
Fenelon did not speak of books
indiscriminately, but of those wise
and good and great books in which
there is distilled the "life-blood of
a master spirit, treasured up to a
life bejond life." Without siichJ
books "God is silent, justice dorm
ant, natural science at a standstill,
philosophy lame, loiters dumb, and
nil things- involved in darkness."
There is every kind of company
among books, a-s m society; and a
choice of friends and associates is as
necessaiT in the one case as the
oilier. Every worthy and imperish
able piece of literature reveals the
personality of some man is, indeed,
some man. It is immersed in, col
ored and charged with, his concep
tions of truth, his ideals of life, his
traits of character, -his jmoral and
spiritual bias. The author's' mastery
of facts, his breath of view, his art
in selecting words and rounding
sentences, the symmetry, promotion
and unity of his woik, are all im
portant. But his attitude toward
life is the really essential thing,
for we are to admit him to the pri
vacy of our thoughts, and take him
into our bosom as a friend.
We should no more choose books
for their style, piimarily than -we
should choose our companions by
the fashion of their dress. Charac--.
ter is everything.
Poe is mysterious, weird and de
pressing. Carlyle is. the soul of-rugged
honesty, the hater ot all shams.
Lamb is the poet of kindly, gentle
and delicate humor. Milton is the
poet of steadfast will and deep le
ligious puipose, resting on God and
moving quietly amid the diead real
ities of existence. Tennyson is t,lui
poet of law, and love, and rational
faith. Browning is the prophet of
sane and wholesome optimism.
Woids worth is a guide into the se
crets of rature and the charm of
lakes and fields. Tluskin is th-HIvS
terpreter of the scul of art and of
social phenomena.
Nothing is more obvious, when we
reflect on U, -than that books have
character, moral and spiritual qual
ities, and are alive and active, seiz
in upon the imagination and
moulding us in their own image.
The moral tone in literature iis
tinguishes the writers of books as
MearJy as a man's features distin
guish him "from others. One, like
Omar, looks out upon life as sordid,
trivial and - evanescent. Another,
like Dante, regards it as noble,
parnest and divine. Sqme men, like
DostoisUy, give us a" sense of evil,
hopelessness and of catastrpihe.
Others, such as Addison and Gold
smith, make us feel, when we have
spent anTiour with them, thatrvve
have hreathed the ,air of mountains
and been bathed in.the sun.
