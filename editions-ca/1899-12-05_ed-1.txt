Protected Cruisers of 8000 TonsWashington Dec 4 The annual report of the secretary of the navy justmade public is a document of unusualinterest dealing not only with Thework of the navy during the past yearand important recommendations forfuture but also discussing importantquestions relating to the navy including the authorization of 18 new waiships the imperative need ofspecial legislation in the earlydays of congress for armor of thebest quality that can be obtained andthe proposition that the thanks ofcongress be given to the commander-in-chiefof the North Atlantic squadron and to the officers and men underhis command for the part they took inthe naval operations at SantiagoThese larger items of the reportreceive extended attention at thehands of Secretary Long As to theincrease of the navy he saysThe number of large swift andpowerful armored cruisers of greatcoal endurance in our navy is largelydisproportionate to the rest of thenaval establishment The experienceof the last year has also shown theneed of several smaller vessels usuallyclassed as gunboats It is thereforerecommended that congress be required to authorize the constructionof the following vesselsFirst Three armored cruisers ofabout 13000 tons trial displacementof a maximum draft at deep load notto exceed 26 feet carrying the heaviestarmor and most powerful ordnance forvessels of their class to be so sheathedand to have the highest practicablespeed and great radius of actionSecond Twelve gunboats of about900 tons trial displacement to besheathed and copperedAnd third as recommended a yearago three protected cruisers of about8000 tons trial displacement carryingthe most powerful ordnance for vessels of this class to be sheathed andcoppered and to have the highestpractical speed and great radius ofactionThe secretary adds in this communication that the 8000 ton protectedcruisers are considered better adaptedto the present needs of the navy thanthe 16000 ton ships required last yearHe also asks that if satisfactory bidscan not be obtained for the new shipsauthority be given to build them atthe United States navy yardsConcerning more war ships the secretary saysThe most important question pertaining to naval construction at thepresent time and one that demandsprompt attention is that of the armorfor vessels now building and for othersauthorized but not yet contracted foron account of the provision in the actof March 3 1899 prohibiting thedepartment from contracting forthe vessels therein authorized untilcontract has been made for the armortherefore within 300 a ton The pricefixed is one for which even inferiorarmor can not be obtained and the department therefore has been unable toinvite proposals for the three battleships and the three armored cruisersauthorized by the act of March 3 1899It is urgently recommended that inthe early days of its next session congress enact such special legislation byjoint resolution or otherwise as maybe necessary to enable the departmentto make contracts early in the comingyear for 7358 tons of armor of the bestquality that can be obtained in thiscountry for the Maine Ohio and Missouri and that the provision of the actof March 3 1899 limiting the price ofarmor to 300 per ton and the restriction preventing the armored vesselstherein authorized from being contracted for until the armor therefor iscontracted for be removedWhatever may be the future actionof congress regarding the establishment of a government armor factoryit can hardly affect the supply of armorfor the Maine Ohio and Missouri as itwill under any circumstances be impracticable to obtain it from such asource in reasonable time to completethe vessels above referred toAn Orphan Asylum for Cuban ChildrenNew Yopk Dec 4 A movement forthe raising of

Purify the Water TheyStrip Reservoir Walls ofCementAt firsli sight it would seem hardlypossible for bacteria to be concerned inhe breaking down of a stone wall yetsuch would appear to be the case according to some ingenious observationsdirected to the nature of the decay ofcementThe gradual disintegration of thecement mortar used in water supplyreservoirs is one of the serious troublesmet with by water engineers and atrouble which so far they have notbeen able to avoid with any measure ofpractical successHitherto this action was supposed tobe the result of the solvent propertyof carbonic acid and other mineral substances commonty present in a watersupply The cement gradually disintegrates and becomes a kind of mudwhich slowly detaches itselfThis strange process is due to the action of none other than that bacteriumknown as the nitrifying organism Anexamination of the mud shows it to beteeming with these organismsThe nitrifying organism is the oneupon which so much depends in theourification of sewage and effete matters On this account its growthshould be encouraged and it is curioustherefore to find that the organism appears as an objectionable factor in theattempt to

theyleans or ieinug xicaheir mind however by anTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS RY TUESDAY DECEMBER 5 1899They had gone tp their work as tsualone morning when Clara Avery suddenly appeared on her fathers claimand saidThat man Bowers has just been upon the cliff I never saw him there before and I thought Id tell youWhat was he doing asked her father straightening upHe seemed to be watching down onthe plain she replied After a minute or two he went back to his diggingand I heard him talking to himselfAll right said her father Keepyour eye on him I guess we sized himup about right Well attend to himThe girl returned to the cave but although she watched Bowers all day heappeared to be very intent upon hiswork washing away as long as he couldsee that nightSupper was the only meal they all atetogether and when it was finished thefriends held a short consultation andmade certain arrangements in theeaveWhen they were completed the tiredmen threw themselves on their beds ofbonghs and were soon asleep with theexception of Avery who however wasstretched on his rude couch in the caveapparently in the same conditionCHAPTER XIIIROBBING THE CAVEHank Bowers had been keenly awareof what was going on about him Hehad worked steadily at his claim andwould have considered himself a luckydog had he not seen the men oppositehim carrying their findings to the caveeach night in a heavy canvas Lag ofb which they had a large suppTheyre diggin fermeThis was his secret consokition andapparently it satisfied him His plansbade fair to come out well if the sailorkept his word and returned This wasthe only disturbing thought 1 wasthe fear that his associate might failhim that induced him to delve with allhis might in order that lie might havegold of his own honestly if he couldget it no other wayOn- the morning of the twelfth dayhe saw the others were all at their workbefore he made his way to the top ofthe cliff Although he knew the younggirl would see him he did not supposeshe would attach any particular importance to the matterThe sun was just showing above thehorizon as he glanced sharply towardthe distant bowlder where a mans figure stood out in plain sight Even as helooked it disappearedHes got more sand than I thoughtmuttered Bowers as he made his wayback to his claim and worked awaywith feverish ener T must risk itto night or neverHe retired to his tent as usual thatnight but not to sleep He had otherwork to do As soon as he was satisfiedthe rest were asleep he made his waycautiously to the cleft in the rock whichled to t he plain below On one shoulderhe carried the results of his two weekslabor in the shape of a weighty bag ofgold while in his hand was a rope ladder which he had fashioned at his leisureTo fasten the last to the top of theobstructing bowlder was an easy taskaided by the light of a match whichcould not be seen outside Down theladder he felt his way and after sometrouble reached the plain where thestarlight made the rest of the way comparatively easjAs he approached the rock he saw adark figure hastening to meet him anda moment later Obed Ilider stood beforehim sayingIs it you BowersYes Rider its me an yer a brickBight on timeI goi here yesterday Sold thehorses fqr 150 apiece and put the coinin a safe place there Got three horseswith me back here What are yougoing to doGit the hosses an f oiler me saidBowers hurriedly Ill explain lateronKider obeyed and as they made theirway across the plain he asked againwhat his companion intended to doAll youve got ter do is ter waitwhere I put yer an do as I tell yer anlo morrer youll be a rich man replied Bowers mysteriouslyWhen they reached the base of thecliff he fastened the animals securelyfcjfcd ed the way into the narrow passage sayingHold on to my coat It isnt farWhen they came to the rope ladder hestruck a match and whisperedMay here till I come an pass somethin down ter yer Take it out anfasten it on the boss an come back Ifyer hear eny shootin come up angimme a handWithout waiting for Rider to reply heascended the ladder leaving the latterin the dark passage and in no enviableframe of mindXow for the gold he muttered ashe crept silently toward the caveIt was a perfect night and the starsoverhead gave sufficient light to enableBowers to see objects quite a distanceaway rie was ODiigeo to ime eicarefully over the broken ground toavoid a fall but he seemed entirely athome at this sort of work avoidingrolling stones as if by instinctIn order to reach the cave he mustpass close to the tents and as he drewnear them he redoubled his caution forhis only hope of success lay in stealthNearer and nearer he crept until hecould hear the heavy breathing of theoccupants and for fully five minutes hestood motionless every sense on tnealertApparently the entire party wasasleep and with noiseless step he stolepast the two tents and fixed his eyes onthe opening to the cave Twice since hisarrival he had managed to peep insideunobserved and only that morning Tiehad seen the pile of fat canvas Lags onthe ground to the left He had also noticed that the boughs and blanketsunon which Avery and his daughterslept were on the opposite sideXow he was within rcn feat of theentrance and after a lat swift glanceat the tents he hind him he dropped tohis knees and crawled deliberately upto itAgain he pausedYes they were both asleep He couldhear the long drawn breathing at theTight and plainly distinguish that ofthe father from his daughterThen like some huge black spider hecrawled into the inky darkness andwas lost to viewInch by inch he advanced guidinghimself by the glimpses he had fixed inhis mind of the place vntil his handrested on the treasure The bags wereheavy and he moved them with difficulty in his recumbent position but hehad come preparedThrusting his hand into his bosom heproduced a short thick thong withwhich he fastened two of the largesttogether pausing often to be certainhe had not disturbed the sleepersWhen this was done he hung themover his neck in such a manner thatthey swung clear from the floor Hisnext move was to stuff two small bacrsinto his shirt Then with infinite patience he worked his way back to thedoor and through itBis breath came hard as he reachedthe open air for the strain had beentremendous Detection meant almostcertain death and even his iron nervehad not been proof against the situationWhen he had somewhat recovered hecrept slowly by the tents until satisfied that all immediate danger waspast Then he rose to his feet andhurried down the bed of the old brookuntil he reached the top of the bowlderIt was the work of a moment to fasten his plunder to a rope and lower itdown at the same time w hispering loudly to his confederateAre you there RiderYes came the answer Wrhat is allthisGold vou fool hissed BowersLash it on one of the critters quickFor a moment he hesitated Shouldhe join his partner and make good TiisescapeApparently cupidity won the day forhe began to retrace his steps toward thecave His first success had made himmore confident and he was well awarethat he had not secured half the bagshe had just touchedAgain he reached the entrance without noise and crawled to the spot wherethe gold was piled against the wallThis time he could only stuff two orthree small bags inside his buckskinshirt and grip one in his teethlie reached the open air safely andwas ji rising to his feet when Averyappeared in the mouth of the cave revolver in hand shoutingThieves Thieves Take that yourobberBut before the words were fairly outof his mouth Bowers had dropped theymMm -WvMany little dainties found their way to thebroad shouldered farmerbag which he had brought out in faiteeth like a retriever and sprang awayin full flightCrack CrackHe heard the bullets sing over hisheadAs he dashed by the tents a mandarted out with suspiciouspromptitudeand fired apparently pointblank at hisback but missed himA few seconds more and he hadreached the rocky cleft and darted outof sight Down the rope ladder hescrambled then with great presence ofmind he stopped long enough to jerk itfree from the spur above so that it fellat his feetRider had not yet returned from hiserrand and Bowers felt his wa rapidlyalong the passage until he emergedupon the plainRunning quickly to the horses whereRider was at work he criedJump up Jump lively an lets gitout o this VamoseHe set the example by throwing himself on one of thehorses and seizing thebridle of the one upon which Rider hadbeen carefullv securing the stolen goldThe latter needed no second invitationand a moment later they were hurryingthe beasts along the back trail as rapidly as the poor light and the nature ofthe ground would permitFor fully two hours they made theirway in silence except for an occasionaloath from Bowers at the uneyennessofthe route then apparently reassuredthat they had made good their escapehe exclaimedThis is the biggest nights work oneman ever done in this ere countryRider I took long chances an I wonout It was a great plantHow did you manage it askedRider eagerly Is it all gold in thembagsIt aint nothin elseWith great pride he now narrated tohis companion the whole villainousscheme and then added complacentlyAll theyve got ter do is tea dig outsome more gold Theres plelty of itThey hogged all thewhar they arebest claims but Im up ter theii nowBut theyll be sfer w wont theyasked ilider fearf u 1 1 3They haint got no hosses hevthey retorted Bowers Besides thatthey dassent leave their claims fer fearsome chap might jump em Its a wonder nobodys struck that place aforeThe two thieves did not draw reinuntil daylight When the sun was fairly up they paused on the top of a hillcommanding a view for a long distanceof the route

astonishing skill with the rifle After shootingby turns at a piece of paper the size ofa dollar nailed on a blackened board 60yards distant and generally hitting itor shooting very near it they varied theamusement by shooting in a prone position from their breasts sides orbacks and by running a short distanceand then firing to show that they wereequally certain of their aim whenmaneuvering as in battle Finally oneof two brothers took a piece of boardonly five inches broad and seven inchealong with a similar piece of paper centered on it for a bulls eye and held theboard in his hand wyhile the otherbrother shot through the paper Positions were then reversed and the second brother held the board The spectators were more astonished thanpleased at this performance when tttheir horror one of the men placed thebit of board between his thighs andsupporting it thus stood smilinglyerect while his brother shot eight bullets successively through the boardThis shooting was done offhand at adistance said to have been upwards ofGO yards though it was probably notover 40 yards The bjstanders wereassured that there were more than 50men in the company who could perforrathe same feat and that there was notone but could plug 10 bullets out of 20within an inch of the head of a tenpenny nail To show the absolute confidence that thej had in each othersmarksmanship some of the riflemen offered to stand with apples on their head swhile others shot them off at a considerable distance but the sensible townpeople refused to witness such foolhardiness Harpers MagazineResult of a

Atlantic greyhound on ourfirst day out from New York Naturally I glanced a second time at the hapless passenger as without another wordhe turned and walked with dignitypast me toward the steerage It wasevident he had no intention of appealing to the captain nor would that recourse have been likely to avail himfor every year matters of this kind areleft more and more to the purser hissuperior officer being sufficiently occupied with the navigation of the shipand the government of the crewThe purser and I were old friends andtraveling companions indeed I was atthat moment on my way to his familiarlittle paneled and portrait lined roomfor a bit of a visit Therefore 1 feltfree to ask him what the row wasOh the same old game of no moneycame on board at the last moment inresponse to a

Iwant toWell was the reply you seem toknow my name at all events May Iask you to explain yourself Are youin the steerage tooNo said I and if you wont thinkme impertinent I want to know whyyou arcKing looked at me for a few secondswith a strange expression and then answered Ill swear Im not here foramusement Have you an object in asking or are you simply gratifying idlecuriosityMr King said I 1 may be a fooland you may be n adventurer but Idont believe so I came out of sincereinterest I heard your brief but pointed conversation with the purser and Icant rrf you off my mind That therejs something peculiar in your positionit evident that there is a good explanation I believe To show my good faithT give you my card Tell me whatwrongIn tely his glance fell to thedeck ile remained thus for half

old comrade thetruth strange as that truth may seemIf nothing worse than this ever happens to me I shant suffer only it isnot very amusingIt happened that I had a cabin to myself I went to the purser and paid theextra sum which would enable me toshare it with King Kenshaw assuredme that I was an idiot but I didnt believe him I was convinced through andthrough of the mans honesty It waswith considerable difficulty thoughthat I finally induced him to become myguest for the voyageI found my cabin mate a most agreeable companion and was truly sorryto part with him at Liverpool There Ibought his railway ticket to Londonand bade him good by All he said to mewasI shall not be profuse ai thanks nowT do thank you however and you maypossibly hear from meI did hear from him nardly had Iarrived

particularly thatI call at No 9 Hatton Garden duringthe afternoon of the appointed dayWhen accordingly the cab put medown at the designated number I foundmyself confronted by a heavy iron grating behind which stood a man armedand in uniform I named my friend ofthe diamond minesYou are right sir was the reassuring answer but will you kindly giveme your cardA boy hurried away with it and Iheard door after door clank behind himas in a prison Presently he returnedaccompanied by Mr King who on seeing me exclaimed I wanted to makesure it was you Come inThe iron door creaked on its hingesand we passed on through a successionof similar barriers until we reached asnug but prisonlike office Here I sawstrewn on a table one or two quarts ofrough black looking pebbles and I wasinformed that I was looking on the veryshipment of rough diamonds which hadbeen the cause of Kings sudden sailingThen from the safe were brought formy inspection diamonds cut and uncut in quantities that I should

been given during the past few years to the eyesightof school children Tests of vision havebeen made in schools ail over the worldand the results have been astonishingif not alarming It has been provedthat short sightedness exists amongpupils in schools and colleges to amuch greater extent than was supposed and what is more disquietingthe number of pupils who have defective vision seems to be steadily growinglargerAnother fact brought out by suchtests is that the proportion of those suffering from imperfect eyesight increases with the advance in studies being least in the lowest classes andgreatest in the highestA German investigator discoveredthis 30 years ago as the result of an examination of the eyes of 1C000 studentsin the schools at and near Bresiau Inthe primary schools he found about sixin every 100 children suffering frompoor eyesight in the intermediateschools the number of nearsighted pupils had increased to more than ten percent in the high schools to 25 percent while in the university CO students out of every 100 were myopic orshort sightedA similar ascending scale of defectivevision has been noted among schoolchildren in other countries althoughthe proportions are not so high anywhere else as in Germany and Russiaa fact explained by the excessive strainput upon the eyes in reading Germanand Russian charactersThat the prevalence of defective eyesight among children is in great partdue to the overstraining of a weakorgan is not open to question Unskilled laborers and others who havenot been obliged to strain their eyesin early life have usually good eyesight but skilled workmen typesetters and so on who use their eyes forclose work and begin to learn theirtrade young are often near sightedDr Casey A Wood of Chicago hasrecently drawn attention to the dangerous strain put upon the eyes of veryyoung children bj certain of the kindergarten tasks but this subject istoo important and too large to be compressed into a single article and
