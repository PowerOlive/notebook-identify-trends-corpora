Somerset used the"Minnesota shift" that was repeatedly thrown for losses. Coughlin, attackle, played a very spectaculargame, both on defense and offense.Taylor at fullback position, whenever called upon, advanced the ovalfor good gains. Connell, at quarterback, made some good plays, bothon offense and defense. McCann,Paris High's impregnable tackle, wasright there all the time whenever hewas called upon to make a hole.Jacoby, who was picked last yearfor the All-Kentucky School end,will be back on the list this year,but despite the weather of Friday,he played a wonderful game. Tuckerand Nash, both playing at halfbackposition, advanced the pigskinthrough the lines and were good onend runs. Clark, at center, on thedefense, played a wonderful game.There was not a play that wascalled but what all eleven men wereinto it with all their grit. But inspite of the weather, neither teamcould score.

E. Protsman, ofLouisville, disputes the claim madeby Paris correspondents regarding aParis paper being the oldest paperin the United States. Mr. Protsmanwrites as follows:"To the Editor of the CourierJournal: "I have noted with interest theitem concerning the Paris Kentuck-ian-Citizenwhich has gone therounds of all the naners and inwhich the claim is made that it isthe oldest paper in the United Statesfrom a standpoint of continuous publication. "I am inclined to think that theaccuracy of this statement can bevery seriously called in question.Certainly there are a number of papers in the United States older thanthe Paris paper. As a matter offact, the Western Sun, published inVincennes, Ind., has been publishedcontinuously since July 31, 1804."In the spring of 1807 the plantfrom which it was issued, bur.neddown, but the publisher, ElihuStout, went back to Kentucky,bought a new outfit and resumed thepublication, which has been continued since. The Sun for more thana century has been in the hands ofthree families. The founder, ElihuStout, published it from 1804 to1845; George E. Green, a Louisvilleprinter, published it for fourteenyears, from 1856 to 1870, and it hasbeen in the Purcell family since1876, a period of forty-five years."It is my opinion that if this investigation' was extended it wouldbe found that there were a numberof papers in the United States whoseterm of service would outrank thatof that paper about which the itemwas published."WILLIAM 0.

"I wouldhave attacks of acute indigestionnearly every . time I ate anything.Those terrible cramping pains andthe distress from gas and bloating"were almost unbearable and I justthought there was no hope for me."But now I'm eating anything andI feel as strong and well as I everfelt in my life. I've gained back allthe weight I lost and six pounds besides and I know from my expperience what Tanlac will do. It's thebest medicine in the world."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the People's Pharmacy and all leadingdrug stores. (adv)USE "SHANKS' MAM)."Walking is becoming a lost art.Autos, street cars, motorcycles, bicycles and trains are enslaving andweakening us.Dr. John H. Finley, former university president and New YorkState Commissioner of Education,walked from New York to Princeton. The spectacle of a man plodding along that auto highway wasso unusual that Finley was arrestedat Rahway, N. J., for vagrancy.Walking is such a lost art, Finley points out, that he got a lot ofspace in the newspapers and setNew York gossipping for weeks, byarriving recently from Europe andremarking that he had walked 100miles on the boat on the way across.When we need something, natureadds it to our bodies. Thus shegrew a long neck on the giraffe so itcould nibble the tender leaves andbuds in treetops.And when we no longer need athing, when it becomes dormant bynot being used, nature takes itaway. For instance, the fish inMammoth Cave, which are blind because they do not need eyes.Imaginative artists have drawnpictures of men on Mars, with hugeheads and puny legs. That wouldbe the natural result of a civilizations of intellectual activity andphysical inactivity.It would be interesting to comeback to this city in another hundred years and see if habitual riding on wheels will have stunted andwithered man's inactive legs. Ourfingers are shorter than those ofprimitive man who had to have longfingers for tree-climbing. ,Whether future men have smalllegs or none at all, does not botherus? But, most certainly, the majority of modern people suffer froma great deal of bad health thatcould be cured by a brisk walk daily. Various cities now have walkingclubs, and it is a movement thatshould become national.The world's walking record " isone mile in 6:25 4-5, held by H. HGoulding, of Canada. If you wantto realize how you have neglectedyour leg muscles, go out and try towalk a mile in fifteen minutes.Right now autumn, with itsbracing air and. its scenic beautiesis the best time of the year forwalking. Try it for exercise, forhealth. And, if you are a businessman, inclined to get to the office inthe morning with a fagged brainand jaded nerves, walking to workwill rejuvenate you and double yourefficiency.To be sick less, walk more.

Although the big city papers generallysupported the amendments and thepapers of Louisville did so vigorouslythe fact appears that wherever thecountry papers opposed them, thecounties in which the country papers circulated defeated them overwhelmingly. The city papers ridiculed the opposition of the countrypapers when the campaign started.But look at the returns from thecountry.
