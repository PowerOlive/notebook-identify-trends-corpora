afternoon at 5:30 o'clock at the

had borne her sufferings with for
titude and Christian resignation.
Before her marriage Mrs. Taylor
was Miss Sara Hanson, of Paris. ' Her
girlhood days were happy ones, spent
here among the friends she loved so
well. No one in the community was
ever more universally admired. Her
sweet disposition and charming
manners made her a favorite here
and- elsewhere. Many years after
moving from Paris she married Gib

an invalid, she was of such a bril
liant mind and beautiful spirit that
her friends crowded around her
whenever possible and felt refreshed
in soul while in her presence. Al
though not having regained her
strength from the shock of her hus
band's death and from a long illness
herself, when America joined the
world war she answered the call to
service and no worker for the Red
Cross was more faithful or more
skillful. She was a lovely represen
tative of the most noble of all the
splendid qualities handed down by
inheritance from the aristocracy "of
the Kentucky pioneers.
Mrs. Gibson was a daughter of
the late Col. Charles Hanson, who
made a conspicuous name in the war
during the troublous days of 1861
1865. She is survived by her moth
er, Mrs. Carrie Wheeler Hanson, one
sister, Mrs. W. R. Thomas, and one
