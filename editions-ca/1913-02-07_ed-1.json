Kentucky Gets Many Buildings.
A difiDatch from Washington "Tues
day was as follows: "When the Pub
lic Buildings Revision Committee fi
nally disposed today ot the items re
ported uy the Subcommittee on Ken
tucky Projects, Representative Can
trill had succeeded not orly in saving
the sabcommitee's itf-msbut had added
site autnorizations for Prestonsburg,
Hodgenville and Central City. The
total amount of Kentuckv authoriza
tions carried in the bill is $433,000.
"The action of the Revision Com
mittee is final and means that in all
likelihood all the items enumerated be
low will be in th draft that goes to
the President. In the Senate tl a 55,
O00 apmopriation for Lancaster will be
added by Senator Branley.
"Mr. Cantrill's abilitv to get public
buildincs for Kentucky has exceeded
the wildest dreams of his colleagues.
He is a member of the committee and
was ch2hman of the subcommittee
that aealt with Kentucky projects.
His subcommittee today reported 'a
total cfS425,500. which total, instead
ofjbein decrtased by the revision
.committee, was skillfully aucmented
by $7,500 by Mr. Cantrill. The Revis
ion Committee cut the authorization
for a site and building at Glasgow
:from $65,000 to 860.000, and scaled
Jown the site apnropriations for Pike
ville and Paintsville.from $7,500 each
to $5,000 each. But it argeed to add
-what Mr. Cantrill asked as a consola
lon prize $7,500 for a site at Central
'City ; $5,000 for a site at Prestonburg,
and $5,000 for a site at Hodgenville."

No Money to Pay Veterans'
Pensions.
Persons entitled to Confederate pen
sions will be disappointed, as it was
decided Wednesday that there was no
rnoney in the State Treasury to pay
the pensions. Wednesday had been
set as the date for the first payment
of pensiuns, but after a conference
between Treasurer Rhea, Governor
JMcCreary and W. J. Stone, Pension
Agent, it was decided that there was
not a dollar in the State Treasury
which could be used for that purpose.
Gas Men Seem to be Holding Off
Latest developments in the efforts
of the Central Kentucky Natural Gas
Co., to secure a franchise to enter this
city leaves the impression that thev
are evading the issue created at a
meeting of the council last month,
when the rranchisp was rejected be
cause of the maximum rate not being
the same as that in effect in uther
cities. .
Since the last meeting of the council
there has been an effort marie to get a
conference with Col. Tom Stewart, of
Winchester, who presented the fran
chise, in regard lo this and with a
view of having this portion of the
franchise changed. He had arranged
to meet City Attorney C. A. McMillan
and MayorJ. T. Hinlon and other city
officials iast Saturday but -failed to
put in his appearance.
From the fact that Col. Stewart was
not in the city and that there has been
no disposition on his part or any other
of the officials of the conlpanygto r con
fer with the city officials, it is the be
lief that the company entertains the
hope that the council will grant the
franchise as it now stands.
At the recent meeting of the council
the members were unanimous in their
opinion that the maximum rate for gas
should be the same as that inJMt. Ster
ling, Lexington and Winchester and
for this reason they refused to grant
the franchise. It was the hope the
natural gas corrmany would accede to
the'demands and grant this concession.
The matter will probably come up at
the next meeting of the council but
there is no chance for the franchise to
be granted unless the change in the
maximum rate from fifty to forty cents
per thousand feet is made.

Contracts Mailed to Reserve
Players
Paris will have a team in the run
ning of the Slue Grass League this
season, or at least the indications point
in that direction at the present time.
Contracts have been mailed to all of
the reserved players and they are ex
pected to be coming in at an early
date.
Ollie Chapman, one of the best men
on the team last season, is an aspirant
for the position as manager of the
team and has written President Bacon
to that effect. He is a free agent, and
from the fact that he probably would
nut sign up under any other conditions
he is being prorninen tly considered.
SecretaryWilliam Shire at the meet
ing of the Blue Grass League mag
nates in Lexington recently set the
rumor at rest that Paris would not
have a club in the league when he
gave out the statement that the club
would start the season and with the
proper interest shown the coming sea
son should be a most profitable one.
President Bacon Tuesday mailed
contracts to Pitchers Blankenship
and Moore, Infielders Locke and Kuhl
man and Outfielders Goodman .and
Goul. A number of other men have
written Mr. Bacon asking that they be
given a tryoutand have been sent con
tracts. The club at present is heavily in
debt and a sufficient fund tor running
expenses before the season-opens must
be raised. In all probability a cam
paign with this in view will be started
at a later date and it is the expressed
hope that loyal fans will contribute
libptally. Paris should not be without
a team this year and there is no reason
whv a good one could not be secure to
represent the town in the Blu Grass.
NOTES.
Walter Mayer, the former star ot the
Bourbcnites, who has been with the
White Sox. has been sent'to the Bir
mingham club in the Southern League.
Tilford Jones, manager of the Pio
neers last season, is 'a candidate for
the Republican nomination for Sheriff
of Laurel county.
George Kircher, a former Blue
Grasser, who has been playing with
Norfolk, is numbered among the hold
outs. Charles Warren, a gigantic young
pitcher of Louisville, has signed with
the Colts for the coming season. He
is only nineteen years old and is said
to be.a wonder. The Lawmakers had
a bid in for the big fellow and his ser
vices were sought by a South Atlantic
League Club.
The Cincinnati Times-Star savs :
"There is one man in Cincinnati who
knew James Thorpe, the famous In
dian all around athlete played profes
sional base ball, lie is Ed McKeman,
manager of the Battle Creek team,
who played on the same team with
Thorpe in the Eastern Carolina League,
now defunct. McKeman covered sec
ond base for Fayettsville while Thorpe
was a member of the pitching staff in
1910. "I remember Thorpe, because
he was tne best of the several Indian
ball players who plaved on various
teams in the Eastern Carolina' League
hat season," said McKernan. "Thorpe
then was rioted for his great speed in
running the bases. He was a fairly
good pitcher, and his one weakness was
batting. I'm very sorry President
August Herrmann of the Cincinnati
Luke McLuke Says
They are wearing vests, fellows.
Honest. The weskits are made of
velvet and moire silk and --are worn
over the wsist. This is good news, as
the vesta have four pockets and they
won't have to exhibit knots m-their
stockings when they want to carry a
little change.
I would hate to he a school teacher
and have plenty of time and no money.
A'woman can't hit a fence when she
throws anything, but when she tries to
shoot her husband she can't miss his
heart.
A heavy union suit isn't vdry thick,
but a whole lot of hobbles have been
let out at the waist band since the cold
wave hit town.
One "of the outdoor sports that I
haven't any use for is to see a wolf
chpsing a chicken.
The smallest thing in the world is a
man who will have his fling and then
whine that the woman tempted him. p
TheAincorseted effect is now the real
thing. And the.girls who have 'em are
as busy making 'em disappear as the
girls who haven't 'em are in trying to
fake up a life-like substitute.
An echo is the only thing in the
world that can beat a woman out of
the last word.
We live so fast nowadays that some
times a bride is figuring on her second
husband while she is combing the rice
out of her hair.
The day they are married He looks
so big that She wonders why they don't
widen the streets. And after they
have been married five years he looks
so little that she wonders why they
do not plug up the holes on the lids
over the corner sewers.
Things are pretty soft for the young
fellows nowadays. They can be intro
duced to a girl at a ball and after
dancing a one-step they know as
much about her as if they had been
courting her for two yearn.
A woman is a person who just
knows that something awful is going
to happen and then gets mad because
it doesn't happen. '
It is surprising where ail the poor
people comes from. Every man in the
world brags about his rich relatives.
We all know that girls are too mod
est to go to see problem plays. But
when a real naughty one is in town
a man can hardly get his hat under
an orchestra seat because of the wads
of chewing gum sticking there.
When ycu get a look at some of
-the things that are called hubsands
you can 't blame a lot of girls for re
maining old maids.
It is surprising how" much comfort a
girl can get out of .a set of swell lin
gerie that she knows nobody can see.
One of the hardships of being a
short man is that you often meet a
tall girl who isjwearing a low. Dutch
collar on her' waist.
This is a funny world. Men are
getting divorces every day because
their wives spend too much money
on clothes. And a girl like Mary
Garden can't find a husband.
Ever notice that no matter how high
hur hobble may be she always hoists it
when she crosses a muddy street. And
when isay "she" I mean the ones
who have props like gas pipes. Cin

Four and Seven in the Pie; Then
Some.
Blackbirds in the neighborhood of
Mr. Jesse Turney on the Maysville
pike, a few miles from this city are so
numerous that, according to the state
ment of Mr. Jack Turney, they almost
break the branches upon thejtrees, and
it is estimated that fully three thous
and of the feathered tribe roost in
each of the trees. The birds became
so noisy the other night that the slum
bers of the members of the family
were disturbed and an effort was made
to abate the nuisance. The young Air.
Turney, according to his story, with
another member of the family went
into the yard with an automatic shot
uun and fired into one of the trees.
No noise from the birds disturbed
them again that night. The next
morning on going into the yard sixty
seven of the birds were found beneath
the tree, while on adjoining farms a
large number were found, and two are
reported to have been picked up in the
vicinity of Millersburg. Some black
Blanche Ring at Lexington.
StamDed with the approval of New
York, Chicago, and the larger cities
of the country, "The Wall Street Girl"
is again Blanche Ring's starring ve
hicle this season, and this popular
comedienne will be seen in this great
est of her successes at the Lexington
Upera House Monday. February 10.
When it comes to singing songs,
there is only one Blanche Rine. In
"The Vall Street Girl" there are
fully a dozen tuneful numbers and half
of them tall to Miss Ring; amonR
them being "Deedle Dura Dee." "I
Want a Regular Man," "I Should Have
Been Born alBoy," and "Whistle It."
Miss Ring has surrounded herself with
a chorus of stunning girls, who assist
materially in making the songs worth
while.
Margaret Mayo and Edgar Selwy
are the co-authors of "The Wall Street
Girl," while Hapgood Burt i respon
sible for the lyrics. The music is by
the late Karl Hoschna and various
others. The piece is in three acts and
irrespective ot the music and songs
would make an interesting rjlay.
James Greene, a Wall street broker,
disappointed in not having a aon.
brings up'his daughter, Jemima, in a
mannish fashion. Her interest cent
ers in a business career until she
meets Dexter Barton from Nevada.
Then she throws her masculine train
ing to the wind3 and adoats all ths
fluffs and flounces s,o dear to the hearts
of most women.
Barton has a gold mining proDosition
to sell and when this is turned down
by Greene, Jemima takes a hand and
buys a half interest. How the gold
mine saves Greene from financial fail
ure and how Jemima falls in love with
her mining partner are cleverly worked
out by the co-authors.
Featured with Mis3 Ring is Will
Rogers, whose lariat throwing and
quaint humor touched New York and
Chicago's funny bone. Among the
other principals are William P. Carle
ton, Paul Porter. Charles Winninger.
