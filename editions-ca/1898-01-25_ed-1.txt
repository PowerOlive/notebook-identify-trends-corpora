ter waiting uponthe scale committee since Tuesdaythe delegates to the interstate jointconference of bituminous coal operators and miners of Pennsylvania OhioIndiana and Illinois and the miners ofWest Virginia received a very unsatisfactory report It was presented atFriday afternoons session and embodied these propositionsThe adoption of the mine run orgross weight system and the uniformity of hours of labor No mention ofan advance in wages was madeThe operators of Ohio Pennsylvaniaand Indiana had fought the adoptionof a mine run system from the startand the votes taken in committee asreported to the convention showedthat they had stood as a unit in opposition to the plan The report was accepted by the convention and its consideration seriatum was recommendedBut it quickly became apparent thatno progress could be made under therules governing the conventionwhich require an affirmative voteto carry any proposition Finally the convention was resolvedinto a committee of the whole and thefirst proposition embodied in the report the mine run system which isnow being usd in Illinois was discussed under the five minute rule Operators and miners of Illinois andminers from all the other states favored the plan but the operators ofPennsylvania Ohio and Indiana refused to consider the change Finallya vote was taken on the motion toadopt the mine run and resultedAyes 24 nays 12 This vote thechair ruled was a defeat forthe motion President Ratchfordin speaking to the motion made the remark that the miners would demandan increase of ten cents He said hehad suggested to the scale committeeand would support in the conventionif it became necessary a measure forthe adoption of the doubje standardwhereby either the mine run or screensystem could be used at the option ofthe operator President Farms of theOhio Mine workers also recommendsthis planAt the evening session OperatorRobbins of Pennsylvania presented aresolution embodying the adoption ofa uniform screen in the competitivefield of 13 inch mesh flat bar Thisplan was discussed at length Severalamendments thereto were defeatedand the motion went over It is quiteevident that it can not be put throughas a single objection will serve to defeat itHow the parliamentary tangle intowhich the convention has been drawnwill end is a matter of much speculation If the proceedings Friday afternoon and evening are any

that we ascended aid what withmy wounded ankle and the pain lrommy eye and the fear lest this wound-should have spoiled my good looks Ihave made no journey to which I lookhack with lesspleasure -I have neverbeen a good climber a any time but itis astonishing what jou can doevenwith a stiff ankle when you have acopper colored brigand at each elbowand a nine inch blade within touch ofyour whiskers We came at last to aplace where the path wound over aridge and descended upon the otherside -trough thick pine trees into avalley Jcjhich opened to the south Intime of peaceil have little doubt thatthe villains were all smugglers andthat these were the secret paths bywhich they crossed the Portuguesefrontier There J were manjv muletracks and once J was surprised ito seethe marks of a large horse where- astream had softened the track Thesewere explained upon reaching a placewhere there was a clearing in the firwood If saw the animal itself halteredto a fallen tre My eyes hardly restedupon it -when I recognized the erreatblack limbs and the -white near theforeleg It was the very horse which Ihad begged for in the morningWiiat then had become of Commissariattmissariat Vidal Was if possible thatthere was anfother Frenchman in asperilous a plight as myself Thethought had hardly entered my headwhen our party stopped and one ofthem uttered a peculiar cry It wasanswered from among the brambleswhich lined the base of a cliff at oneside of the clearing and an instant laterten or a dozen more brigands came outfrom amongst them and the two parties greeted each other The newcomers surrendered my friend of thebradawl with cries of grief and sympathy and then turning upon me theybrandished their knives and howled atme like the gang of assassins that theyTURNING UPON ME THEY BRANDISHEDTHEIR KNrVESwere So frantic were their gesturesthat I was convinced that my end hadcome and was just bracing myself tomeet it in a manner which should beworthy of my past reputation whenone of them gave an order and Iwas dragged roughly across theA littleglade to the brambles from which thisnew band had emergedA narrow pathway led through themto a deep grotto in the side of the cliffThe sun was already setting outsideand in the cave itself it would havebeen quite dark but for a pair oftorches which blazed from a socket oneither side Between them there wassitting at a rude table a very singularlooking person whom I saw instantlyfrom the respect with which the othersaddressed him could be none other thanthe brigand chief who had receivedon account of his dreadful characterthe sinister name of El Cuchillo Theman whom I had injured had been carried in and placed upon the top of abarrel his helpless legs dangling aboutin front of him and his cats eyes stilldarting glances of hatred at me I understood from the snatches of talkwhich I could fojlow between thechief and him that he was thelieutenant of the band and thatpart of his duties was to lie in waitwith his smooth tongue and his peaceful garb for travelers like myselfWhen I thought of how many gallantofficers may have been lured to theirdeath by this monster of hypocrisy itgave me a glow of pleasure to thinkthat I had brought his villainies to anend though I feared it would be at thecost of a life which neither the emperornor the army could well spareAs the injured man still supportedon the barrel by two comrades was explaining in Spanish all that had befallen him I was held by several ofthe villains in front of the table atwhich the chief was seated and had anexcellent opportunity of observing himI have seldom seen any man who wasless like my idea of a brigand and especially of a brigand with such a reputation that in a land of cruelty he hadearned so dark a nickname His facewas bluff andbroad and bland withruddy cheeks and comfortable littletufts of side whiskers which gave himthe appearance of a well-to-do grocerof the Ruev St Antoine He had notany of those flaring sashes or gleamingweapons which distinguished hislowers but on the contrary he wore figood broadcloth coat like a respectablefather of a family andve his brownleggings there was nothing to indicatea life among the mountains Ilis surroundings too corresponded with him23self and beside his snuff box upon thetable there5tpod a great brown bookwhich lookedjike a commercial ledgerMany other oooks were ranged along aplank between two powder casks andthere was a great litter of papers someof which had verses scribbled uponthem All this I took in while heleaning indolently back in his chairwas listening to the report of his lieutenant Having heard everything heordered the cripple to be carried outagain and I was left with only threeguards waiting to hear my fate Hetook up his pen and tapping his forehead with the handle of it lie pursedup his lips and looked out of the cornerof his eyas at the roof of the grottoI suppose said he at last speakingvery excellent French that you arenot able to suggest a rhyme for theword Covilha- I answered that my acquaintancewith the Spanish language was so limited that I was unable to oblige himIt is a very rich language said hebut less prolific in rhymes than eitherthe German or the English That iswhy our best work has been done inblank verse a form of literature whichas I need not remind a Frenchman iscapable of reaching great heights ButI fear that such subjects are somewhatoutside the range of a hussarI was about to answer that if theywere good enough for a guerrilla theycould not be too much for the lightcavalry but he was already stoopingover his half -finished verse Presentlyhe threw down the pen with an exclamation of satisfaction and declaimeda few lines which drew a cry of approval from the three ruffians who heldme His broad face blushed like ayoung girl who receives her first complimentThe critics are in my favor it appears said he We amuse ourselvesin our long evenings by singing ourown ballads you

tobusiness May I ask what your nameisEtienne GerardRankColonelCorpsThe Third hussarsYou are young for a colonelMy career has been an eventful oneTut that makes it the sadderjsaidhe with his bland smile -I made no answer to that but I triedto show him by my bearing that I wasready for the very worst which couldbefall meBy the way I rather fancy that wehave had some of your corps here saidhe turning over the pages of his bigbrown register We endeavor to keepa record of our operations Here is aheading under June 24 Have you nota young officer named Soubiron a tallslight youth with light

buried him alive For a moment I was too stunned to act Then Ihurled myself upon the man as he satwith that placid smile of his upon hislips and I would have torn his throatout had the three wretches not draggedme away from him Again and againI made for him panting and cursingshaking off this man and that straining and wrenching but never quitefree At last with my jacket nearlytorn off my back and

verminwill perish together My faith I havea rough side to my tongue and therewas not a hard word that I had learnedin fourteen campaigns which I did notlet fly at him but he sat withthe handle of his pen tapping against life forehead and his eyes- squinting up at theroof as if he had conceived the idea ofsome new stanza It was this occupation of his which showed me how Imight get my point into him Youspawn said I you think that you aresafe here but your life may be as shortas that of your absurd verses and Godknows it could not be shorter thanthatOh you should have seen him boundfrom his chair

campaigns until my charger had the misfortune to put his hoof through itI only tell you thisr however to showyou that I was never a mere rough soldier like Eapp or Lefebvre As I layin that brigands camp I had little timeor inclination to think about such matters They had thrown me down under a tree the three villains squattinground and smoking their cigaretteswithin hands touch of me What todo I could not imagine In my wholeCOL GERARD SHALL HAVE A DEATHOF HIS OWNcareer I do not suppose that I have tentimes been in -as hopeless a situationBut courage thought I couragemy brave boy you were not made acolonel of hussars at twenty eight because you could dance a cotillon Youare a picked man Etienne a -man -whohas come through more than two hundred affairs and this little one is surelynot going to be the last I beganeagerly to glance about for somechance of escape and as I did so I sawsomething which filled me with greatastonishmentI have already told you that a largefire was burning -in the center of theglade What with its glare and whatwith its moonlight everything was asclear as possible On the other side fthe glade there was a single tall fir treewhich attracted my attention becauseits trunk and lower branches were discolored as if a large fire had recentlybeen lit underneath it A clump ofbushes grew in front of it whichconcealed the base Well as Ilooked towards it I was surprised to seeprojecting above the bush and fastenedapparently to the tree a pair of fineriding boots with the toes upwards Atfirst I thought that they were tiedthere but as I looked harder I sawthat the3r were secured by a great nailwhich was hammered through the footof each And then suddenly with athrill of horror I understood that theywere not empty boots and moving myhead a little to the right I was able tosee who it was that had been fastenedthere and why a fire had been lit beneath the tree It is not pleasant tospeak or think of horrors my friendsand I do not wish to give any of youbad dreams to night but I cannot takeyou among the Spanish guerrillas without showing you what kind of menthey were and the sort of warfare thatthey waged I will only say that I understood why Monsieur VidaPs horsewas waiting masterless in the groveand that I hoped that he had met thisterrible fate with sprightliness andcourage as a good Frenchman oughtIt was not a very cheering sight forme as you can imagine When I hadbeen with their chief in the grotto Ihad been so carried away by my rageat the cruel death of young Soubironwho was one of the brightest f ids whoever threw his thigh over a chargerthat I had never given a thought to myown position Perhaps it would havebeen more politic had I spoken theruffian fair but it was too late nowThe cork was drawn and I must drainthe wine Besides if the harmlesscommissariat man was put to such adeath what hope was there for mewho had snapped the spine of theirlieutenant No I was doomed in anycase so it was as well perhaps that Ishould have put the best face on thematter This beast could bear witnessthat Etienne Gerard had died as hehad lived and that one prisoner atleast had not quailed before him I laythere thinking of the various girls whowould mourn for me and of my dearold mother and of the deplorable lossthat I should be both to my regimentand to the emperor and I am notashamed to confess to you that I shedtears as I

of training to enable them to endure a longtime without food They were thensent to the door of some rich personwhere they publicly made a vow to remain fasting until a certain sum ofmoney was paid or until they perishedfrom starvation To cause the deathof a Brahmin was considered so heinour an offense that the cash was generally forthcoming but never without aresolute struggle to determine whether

school and so at firstwe saw a good deal of him I remember I went over to his room that firstevening after he was settled and foundhim sitting in his big armchair beforethe open fire He jumped up quicklywhen I came in and laid something slylv on the mantelniece It looked likea photograph and I began to blow himabout being homesick so soon andasked if he was looking at motherspictureHe flushed up quickly and said it wasnothing to be ashamed of if it had beenhis mothers picture but that as it happened it was no such thing Then hechanged the subject and asked how Tliked the roomHave you noticed my desk heasked pretty proudly I bought it ofThome the fellow who had this roomlast He was first marshal last classday and a first rate fellow too I judgeGreat isnt it StocktonIt was a handsome desk mahoganyroll top with brass knobs and all thatHe unlocked and rolled up the top forfjpny benefitThorne gave me the key himselfwith his alumnus blessing to day hesaid and when I asked if finding washaving he laughed and said I was welcome to whatever I found in the oldark for he was pretty sure there wasnothing but undergraduate dust in thecracksBut you did find something afterall I asked quickly for though he isa good lawyer now he never could keepa secret in those daysOh well not so much he said carelessly but I saw him glance toward themantel I guessed in a minute what itwas and before he could stop me Isprang for the photograph at which hehad been looking when I entered Hejumped up angrily Give me thatphotographOh ho So its a girl is it And amighty pretty one tooThe girl was evidently tall and darkwith a splendid figure a strong facealmost masculine but perfectly featured and great big dark eyes full offun She had a huge shade hat banging by its ribbons and was smiling soas to show the prettiest teeth I ever sawThorne was a lucky fellow I wonderah heres a name on the back Iwent on composedly Bose ThornePshaw So she was only his sisterWhat a fakeBriarwood had the picture by thistime and after putting it away in thedesk turned -upon me indignantly againYou had no business to meddle withit said heShes a stunner I answered and iffinding is having Briarwood I adviseyou to hunt lip the original pretty quickold manWith this parting shot I hurried outof the room dodging the curve on aGreek lexicon that came tumbling afterme After that I saw more or less ofBriarwood principally less for he soongrew too popular to stay in our set newas easily the man of his class and nowonder for take him all around he isabout as fine a chap as I ever sawOne night I dropped around for a pipebefore turning in and to borrowHarrys notes to use before the midyear examination fin something orother Just as I was leaving I happened to remember my former callOh by the way Briarwood I askedhave you seen Miss Thorne latelyFinding is having you knowrThad no idea it was more than a jokewith him then But I was completelyknocked out to see him change colorand jump up looking as madas a hatterYou keep quiet about that will youStockton he said grufflyOh dont mind me old man I replied cheerfully Youve got it badbut youll pull through all right Cantyou get Thorne to introduce you Lookhim up Briarwood thats my adviceHarry did not reply but hunted up thenotebooks and gave them to me stillW with that flush on his face This set mothinking I believed we might getbme fun out of Briar wood over thisthing and told one or two of the fellows about it in my room the next nightThe idea of old Briarwood being in lovevas pretty rich but we all agreed tokeep it dark and watch developmentsuntil we had a chance to play a goodgame on himI watched Harry after that wheneverhe came in my waj and I certainly noticed a new look about him there wasno doubt about it Harry was in lovewith that photograph And as the yeardrew on to spring and the spring toward class day the young mans fancylightly turned to thoughts of EoseThorne more and more so we judgedIt was one evening along about thefirst of June I think when one of thefellows Goodrich expelled the yearwe graduated -came running into myroom all out of breath for laughingand threw himself into my chair soweak he could hardly speakOh its the rich joke on Briarwoodhe gasped at last its the photographhe always carries around with himEose Thorne oh my eye And heexploded again That picture itsThomes own photo taken last year inthe Pi Eta theatricals Heres a duplicate of it I found it in Van Buytersroom to day And he pulled out of hispocket another likeness of the fair BoseThorneThe joke was too good to keep Theidea of dignified old Briarwood beingin love with another fellow a shaverand bewigged Bose blossoming onthe Thorne treeAnd he carried that thing around inhis vest pocket next his heart roaredGoodrich I saw it the other atthe gym Oh the soft meat Hellnever hear the last of thisThen we concocted the fine schemeWe agreed that the crowd should meetaround at Briarwoods rooms some evening quite accidentally and manageto bring Bose Thorne into the talksomehow till he fired up then we wouldgive it all away and explain that hislady love existed only as a strappingtihimnus and the joke would be on himfor the benefit of the whole collegeFor we planned to get a version ofTHE BOUBON NEWS TUESDAY JANUARY 25 1898itinto the Lampoon with portraitsWe set one night just before class dayfor our seance and all the bojs promisedto be there to see poor old Briarwoodthrough with it Well sirs that evening Harry was in his best mood Hehad just finished his last examinationand was feeling pretty fine altogetherfor his years rank was a sure thinghowever the profs might play the deucewith the rest of us He did the honorsin great shape and showed no sign ofcaring for any girl let alone the photograph whose original he had neverseen The boys began to put up thegame before long Goodrich was theone to start it offI say fellows he called across theroom dont you remember littleThorne Yes you do at Adams spreada year ago little Bose in the reddress We had all come on for classday the year beforeOh yes said another fellow with agrin you mean the girl who took toomuch champagneAnd couldnt walk to the carriagechimed in Eddy with his horse laughI remember that fellows I carriedherShe was more than a handful forThorne that little sister of his saidanother And so they went on withtheir jokes about the little devil inred Bosie as they called her eachgrowing more personal in his hints andinnuendoes which were received withroars of laughter and assenting grins ofdelightBriarvfood was all this time sittingglum and quiet by the window with hishead bent in his hands pulling fiercelyat his pipe without a word ThenGoodrich said suddenlyI say fellows how many of you haveher picture She only gives em to theones she loves best sweet Sozodont Igot mine the night I took her to Marliaves for a little French dinner afterthe theater Hows that Briarwood Isthat the way you got yoursHariy jumped up quickly and stoodfacing Goodrich defiantly with his eyesflashingOh youve got it there we knowwent on Goodrich tapping his breastpocket Ive seen it isnt it like thisAnd he pulled the duplicate out of hisown pocket triumphantlyBut Goodrich overdid the thing healways did He was a qoarse brute andthe faculty was all right to get rid ofhim as soon as they did He made someother remarks which were quite unnecessary for the purposes of our joke andwhich we were all of us ashamed tohear and then he stepped forward as ifto grab the photograph out of HarrysXiocketBut Briarwood was thoroughly wakedup now With a gesture he flung awayhis pipe and then planting his big fistsquarely between Goodrichs eyes senthim tumbling back with a crash againstthe doorIts a lie its all a lie he saidsteadily and in a low tone She isJack Thomes sister and I know she isa fine girl Im not ashamed to wearher photograph but I wont take it outfor- you fellows to see If any of therest of you dare to say that Goodrichspoke the truth let him step out andsay it and then Ill knock him downJust then there was a knock on thedoor We must have made a terribleracket there with our laughing and jollying and when Goodrich fell he made abig crash for he was a heavy fellowhalf back on the team until he was expelledAt any rate as we all stood therelooking sheepish enough in walkedMr White the proctor He stood holding the doorknob in one hand and looking first around at the crowd of us thenstraight at Harry who was still standing with his fists clenched glaringdown at Goodrich on the floor ThenMr White asked sternlyWhats all this row Mr Briar-wood Bid you knock this man down VI did sir said Harry firmlyWhj may I askHe insulted a ladyKA lady What ladyHarry made no reply and some ofthe fellows snickered But Harrylooked around quickly with a glancethat made us all keep quietThis is the ladys photograph hesaid at last steadily taking the picture from his breast and handing it tothe proctor with much dignity She isthe sister of a man who is an honor tothe college You know him Mr WhiteNo one said a word even to explainthe joke Mr White started when hesaw the face turned it over and readthe name as if puzzled Then as ifsuddenly comprehending he glancedaround the circle of us with a quizzicallook and a half contemptuous smileBriarwood he said you werequite right I excuse your action andthank you in the name of the lady before all these gentlemen Goodrichget up and out of here as quickly as youcan Then turning to Harry againhe said pleasantly as if nothing hadhappenedMr Briarwoow there are a lady andgentleman waiting outside who wouldlike to look at this room if you areprepared to receive visitors nowWe all stood mute and awkwardwhile the proctor after receiving a puzzled but gracious assent from Harryturned and spoke to some one outsidethe doorMr Briarwood he said reenteringfollowed by the two strangers 1think you have met Mr Thorne beforeHe wished his sister to see his old college room It is the first time she hasever been to the college I assure youMiss Thorne it is not usually sonoisy here The boys were having alittle frolie to nightOne by one we slunk silently out ofthe room fixing our dazed ejes to thelast upon the feminine counterpart ofthe unlucky photograph a sweeterfar lovelier version of the handsomebrother by whose side she stood chatting graciously with Harry and looking coldly at us from under half-disdainfuleyelidsWe said little more to one anotherthat night but we all wondered andvs onder still how much of that racketshe overheard She had come to Cearly for her first class day for she hadbeen studying abroad for the last threeyears and so had missed her brothersspread But she had wanted to see hisold room now Briarwoods and hadstumbled upon our jokeNo it didnt get around the collegeI dont know whether Harry himselfever quite understood it You see wenaturally did not care to have it noisedaround much for even Goodrich agreedthat the joke wasnt exactly on BriarwoodOh yes her name really was BoseThorne had written it on the photo because its resemblance to her was so perfect We saw it still more plainly onclass day when she wore a big leghornhat as she walked about the yard withHarry the lucky dog We hung aroundthem anxiously the whole crow VjjTis jhoping for an introduction but jiherof them paid any attention to us hatwas onlv Harrys freshman year Youshould have seen him at his own classdayWhats that Of course he did Harry always got whatever he tried for incollege and out Beside hadnt

INDIAN TRUSTTrihal Territories Governed by a FewScheming RcdsliinsThe Indian territory as at presentgoverned is the most successful trustin the United States About 45000 Indians control the territory which ineludes among its inhabitants anywherefrom 200000 to 2500001 white peopleThese white people have no voice inmaking laws under which they live andcannot acquire title to the houses theybuild or the lands they till If the 45000 Indians were 45000 people whose individual land holdings made up the aggregate area of the territory the situation would be peculiar but as a matterof fact there are no such things thereas individual titles The land of eachtribe is in theory held by the tribe as awhole and leases are given of tractswhich carry with them any improvements placed thereon In practice theland of each tribe is controlled by alittle knot or ring of chiefs or leadingmen The bulk of each tribe outsidethis charmed circle are mere squattersBeaders who have never been in theIndian territory may fancy that the Indian chiefs are crested warriors of theforest A brief stay in the territorywill put an end to any such impressionAn Indian chief in the territory looksa good deal like a

Miles ohRemarkable MissionWilliam Shopshire once a slave nownearly 100 years old decrepit and infirm walked nearly 100 miles to Cincinnati for the purpose as he says of finding an honest lawyer and landed penniless at the Hammond street stationThe old man was given a berth in thecellroom of the station house by LieutKane and locked up for a nights restHe had richly deserved it for his shoesfrom long travel were worn throughand his bruised and bleeding feet restedon the groundIt all sounds like a travesty on theprofession for with apologies to thecredence of the general public the factis well

his effects untilnow he has made one last supreme effort to reclaim- his lands The chapterof his trouble is a long one and full ofquarrels disputes and legal technicalities but from the story he told in hisfeeble way at the station it seems thathe has been often victimized owing tohis generosity until all his earthly possessions have been drawn into thecourts His faculties are stilland his mind on the subject ofhis troubles is remarkably clear ns tonames dates and iegal papers All themoney he started with was spent forprovisions along the route to this cityHe offers 4000 in cash to the attorneywho will go into the Kentucky courtsand reclaim three pieces of propertywhich he claims are held unjustly byothersWhen he started for this city he had noidea as to the immense distance he hadto travel before he reached his destination but he was so determined to findan honest unprejudiced lawyer thathe would not retrace his steps thoughoften overcome with hunger and fatigue Shopshire

as practiced inEurope it is sown in the open groundas soon as it is fit io work in April andkept carefully clear of weeds until thetime of planting in June and JulyIn our warmer climate if raised inhot beds as in England a majority oithe plants would run to seed The topsare shorn off once or twice beforeplanting so as to insure stockjplants which suffer less on beiii transplanted After the ground has beennicely prepared lines are struck out onthe level surface three feet apart anothe plants set six inches apart in rowsIf the weather is dry at the time oiplanting great care should be takeEthat the roots are property firmedOur custom is to turn back on the rowand press by the side of each planigently with the foot This compactthe soil and partially excludes the aiifrom the roots until new rootlets areformed which will usually be in 48hours after which all danger is overThis practice of pressing the soil closely around the roots is essential in plantof all kinds and millions of planiiare annually destroyed by its omissionAfter the jlanting of the celery is completed nothing further is to be done foisix or seven weeks except running between the rows with the cultivator oihoe and freeing the plants of weeds until they get strong enough to crowdihenr down This will bring- us to aboulnjiniddle oi August by which time wehave usually that moist and cold atmosphere essential to the growth of celeryThen we begin the earthing upnecessary for the blanching and whiten-Ang of that which is wanted for use during the months of September Octobei-and November The first operation isthat of handling as we term it that isafter all the soil has been drawn ujagainst -the plant with the hoe it iffurther drawn close around each planiby the hand firm enough to keep theleaves in an upright position and prevent them from spreading- This beingdone more soil is drawn against the roweither the plow or hoe as circumstances require so as to keep the plantin this upright position The blanching process must however be finishedby the spade which is done by diggingthe soil from between the rows andbanking it up clear to the top on eachside of the row of celery
