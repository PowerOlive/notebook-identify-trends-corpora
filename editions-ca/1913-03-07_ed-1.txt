Giotnier;and Furnisherstempt made to burn her to death EffieEvans, who more than a week rko wasfound in an unconscious condition ather home in the colored suburo ofClaysville, suffering- fiom a number ofsevere burns, charges John Carter, thenegro with whom she lived, with Jhecrime.I'JL'he confession of the woman wasmade to her brother, Walter Evans,colored, of Cay top, Ohio, who came tothis city pfter learning of the sad fatewhich befell his sister. After reDeitedattempts he succeeded in inducing thewoman to tell the story of the tragddvv. hich was followed by the arrest ofGaiter, who is now in jail.According to the story of the brotherof the woman, she told him of all theevents leading up to the attempt Carter made on her life. He said thatthe day the attempt to burn her todeath was made the negro was in thehouse with her and that he choked heralmost into insensibility, saturated herclothing with kerosene and applied amatch.Evans, it is said, last night told thepolice ot the confession of his eisterand an attempt was to be made tocapure Carter. The latter had gone tothe office of Drs. Kenney and Rank nwhere he was followed by the Evat.sboy who told the notice of his locationand Carter was placed under arrest byPatrolman G. N. McKennev.According to the story of the policethey have been keeping a close watchon Carter for several d.ys. His actions have been verv suspicious sincethe day the attempt ws made uponthe woman's life anpyft was the opinion that he knewsomething of theaffair and wasresponsible for thewoman insifctiog that her burns werethe result oiQn attempt to start a firewith coal on, an explosionS"followingwhich set fire tc her garments.According to those who visited thescene shortly after the woman wasfound, her underclothing bore evidence of being saturated with kerosene and this fact serves to strengthen the theory that instead of meetingwith an accident there had been an attempt at fuul play.The brother of the woman told a pitiful story of her suffering from the injuries she had sustained, and huw hehad pleaded with her to give him a correct account of the tragedy. He saidthat until yesterday she stoutly protested that it was nothing other thanan accident, but when plied witn questions as to why her undergarmentswere so well saturated with the oilakid that practically none was to befound on the portions of her skirtswhich were not burned, she told ofCarter choking her into semi-unconsciousness,laying her on the floor,pouiingjkerosene over her underwearand setting fire to it.When found she was in an unconscious condition nut revived shortlyafter medicalaid arrived. For the pastseveral davs she has been in a veryserious condition and it is probablethat she may die at anv moment.Walter Evans, the woman's brotherfrenzied over the confession nf hissister, imnlicating Carter, attemptedto ashault the prisoner while he was inthe custody of the arresting officer andhad it not been for timely interferencewould probably have succeeded.Carter stoutly protests his innocpneeanddeclared there was no attempt onhis part to do the woman any harmand that the burns she received wasthe result of her attempt to start a firewth coal oil. He says that be has hadnothing but kind feeling toward thewoman, and that he will have witnesses to prove the affair was an accident and that there were a 'number inthe house at the time it occurred.It waa stated last night the Evanswoman could not survive the night andfslthat an attempt would be made to geta dying statement.The negro who is charged with committing the fiendish crime is wellknown and is said to bear a very badreputation. He was employed as alaborer at the stables of J. H. Fuhrman. Jo other motive can be assigned forthe alleged attempt on the Evanswomanlife other tjftn jealousy. Several days following the tragedy an attempt was made to verifv a rumor ofthe attempt-to burn the woman, andwhen questioned Garter assumed a sullen attitude and would talk but little.5Great ReductionsONinterOudsANDuvercoats- And All Winter GoodsICome Early and Take Advantageof Reduced Prices.OeeOur footweariMifccSieOutfitters to IVienBlakemore,Paris, Kentuckyivimmmmm.tn&6Sy(snummimimij ''nitTriixEiiiuniiiiiiuiininHUHiiiifuuiiinuiHinnuHnniuiiiHuiiiiiiiuuMimmiininmiiiHurrim3,MtljifflQ f W"- "--- w-.-HoSifmm-Elks Elect OfficersThe annual election of officers ofPaiis Lodge No. 373 Benevolent Protective Order of Elks was held at theEks Hall Tuesday avening.,resuiting asfollows: yExalted Ruler S.

Vogel, manager of the BigCity Minstrels half a hundred ofthem of extraordinary size and talentis an enthusiast in his business andis thoroughly posted as to the originand growth of the popular style ofamusement he Durveys. Said Mr. Vogel to our sDeciai commissioner:"Away back in 1843, to be precise,February 6, at the Bowery Amphitheatre, appeared the Virginia Minstrels,four in number mind you, four thatwas a first part combining banjo, violin, bone, castinet and tambourine.E. P. Christy, who has often been called the lather of polite minstrelsy, introduced the dress coat first part, andthe really excellent parlor concert wasemulated by all ol Christy's competitors. Writers who dwell lovingly andreverently over the past, are wont todilate enthusiastically over the daysor rather nights of the Bryants at Mechanics' Hall, Broadway, when theyannounced Jerry, Dan and Neil Bryantand thirteen star performers, and theorchestra sat on one side of the stageand plaved for the acts of the olio onthe other side."Great Scott!" ecxlaimed the commissioner. "During the Civil War,"to quote the old minstrel walk around,"then greenbacks were plenty andscattered all around. Newcomb.Sharply and Duprez and Benedict set asmany as twenty people in the first partbut it was not until years after thatthe minstrel managers made anv special effort to give a first part combining a large numjber of performersbacked by a most gorgeous stage setting. The truth is thatTformerly theinadequate halls and apologies for theatres did not warrant the etxravagance of the modern marvelous productions. Now, with palace theatresand increased population one can go tothe very verge of rashness and recoup,i My Radium Palace is probably themost elaborate and costliest first partsetting ever conceived. It was designed by M. Bucher, who originates allthe drapes for Blanche Walsh, Belasco's Darling cf the Gods, and MrsLeslie Carter's productions. The illumination will be supplied with 1,000incandescent lights and a number ofthe most costly calciums.""The Virginia Minstrels, four innumber count them, four wouldhardly be in it," remarked our commissioner, as he withdrew.John W.

Mr. Wright had felt withinhis soul the peace and beauty of thehills and he wished to Bet down theirmeaning belore him. He made a playthat in plot is compelling, one thatnever fails in sincerity. The peoplewho move in it are so human that theauditor will pick them out for like anddislike as if he really knows then-.The scene of the play is in the highhills of the Ozark mountains.

We referto the recent conflagration which wiped from existence one f the mostcomplete distilling plants in Kentuckyand an enterprise which afforded employment all of the year to almost ahundred men skilled or the day laborer. It ha deve'oped since the destructive blaze of last Sunday morning thathad it not been for the negligence ofa telephone operator a hundred thousand dollar fire might have been confined to a few thousand; the damagemight have been undergoing repairs atthis moment and hastened to a completion and even though precludingoperations would not have been nearso serious. But as it is the buildingand equipment aie in ruins with a barenrobability of them ever being replaced. There can possibly be no explanationof the failure to answer the call of thenightwatchman, who after discoveringa smouldering fire, attempted to communicate the fact to the fire department. Think of the time it took anaged man to traverse the distance between the distilling plant and the nearest fire alarm box and it will be easyto imagine what headway a sparkamong the chaff in the dustroom couldgain ! There may havojjeen adelay inreaching the scene with fire fightingapparatus, owing to the distance, butall things considered there should, under no circumstances, have been theimmense loss from this single fire.We may be misguided in the statements cf others, regarding thp incident, but we have no cause to doubttheir veracity. Ihey contend at least,that prompt telephone Eervice wouldhave afforded an opportunity to battlewith the flames at the beginning ofthe conflagration which 'resulted ao2seriouslv. This development is to be regardedseriously. The case just brought topublic noticejaay find a time for repetition. It may occur at some timewhen the business or residence sections of our town are in imminentdanger; what then would be the result? It cannot be overestimated andwill bear close consideration. Whatmight or might not' happen is but conjecture and loss of momenta are sometimes costly.This case -is-well worthy 'of investigation. 'It should be done as a precaution to prevent a lecurrence at anyrate to determine why a telephone callunder similar or even different circumstances ia not answered.

Had itbeen possible to produce and holdrepdy 20.000 of the new models, awaiting the announcement, and had a sufficient supply of freight cars been accumulated to ship them in, the demandsot the sale staff in the field mighthave been satisfied. But thia is notan age of miracles. To secure thematerial, to install the new machinery, to teach new tasks tc a manufacturing organization of many thousandsof men--all this had to be done by theproduction Department before the newStudebaker "25," "35" and "6" couldbe turned out at the rate of a hundredof each, in a day's work.Goaded by the knowledge that theentire Studebaker organization waswaiting, it is surely tojhe great creditof the Production Department that itdid not become hysterical and attemptmanufacture on a big scale before theequipment was ready. In this standthe production and. sales chiefs wereunited. The cars must come as soonas possible, but they must not come ina slipshod way or embodying anythingbut first class appearance and workmanship. Patience and moral courageto no small degree were required towork out such a program, but the Production Department had both. ; By theexercise of thes two qualities, coupledwith the hardest kind of intelligent,presevenng effort, production is making rapid and magnificent Htrides.From the very first the quality of thenew cars has been uniformly excellent.It has been worth while to wait forsuch results. And while the manufacturing organization hasn't yet reachedhigh speed, it is out of low, and acquiring mighty momentum in intermediate. "Never before in automobile historyhas any manufacturing organizationchanged models and acquired as greatproduction speed as the Studebaker. ,He's Coming Here,Who?
