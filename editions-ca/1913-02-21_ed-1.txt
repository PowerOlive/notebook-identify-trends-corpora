He was taken intocustody at the Simms constructioncamp near Poindexter, where he wasi working on the L. & N. double track,and was brought to Pans luesdayafternoon.The negro, it is beieved, is cmnectedwith the" murder of Fred Kelley, a! railroad brakeman at Fink, Va., lastOctober. He is said to have been incompany with Charles Greenlea, whenthe crime was committed. The menescaped after the killing and' havesince bpen at large.According ro a statement of Bennett he was in company with Greenlealast Friday night, when the latter visited the railroad camp, and that hewent in the direction of Cincinnati.He stoutly protests his innocence ofany connection with the crime forwhich he is being held on suspicionand declares he was never in Virginia.The marks of identification comparevery favorably with the descriptionsent out by the authorities at Bluefields, W. Va. He is about five feetten inches tall, weighs 175 pounos,black skin, and has a scar on the leftside of his face, about one and a halfinches long. He also has a very distinct scar on his neck.Immediately after the arrest of thenegrothe authorities at Bluefield werenotified and Patrolman Link was instructed to hold the man until hecould'be identified. A telephone message received from Mr. Copenhaven,superintendent of the C. & O. railroad yesterday morning was to theeffect that the description comparedvery favorably with that of the negrowanted and instructed that he be heldpending an investigation and a determined effort to identify the man, whohe says is very ilkely to be the newanted for the crime.A letter received from the Baldwin-FeltDetective Agency at Blueflelds. W. Va., yesterday by Patrolman Link, was to the effect that thedescription given of the negro left theimpression that he was the man wanted, and stated that a member of theagency would be in Paris in a fewdays to identify him.Daughters and Guards to Meet.The Daughters of the Confederacywill meet at their rooms in the courthouse Saturdav afternoon at 2:30o'clock.

A Chicago aeroplane manufacturingcompany has passed into the hands ofa receiver because of poor business.The flying machines it expected tobuild did not go up ; so the concern didWhen the aeroplane vwas a brandnew contrivance and public interest inits performances was at a white heatmany persons expected that historyas it had been written in the case ofthe automobile trade would repeat itself in the development of this newindustry. They guessed wrong, andsome ,who made such inconsideratehaste to get in on the ground floor nowfind themselves in the sub-cellar.The demand for aeroplanes hasshown little'growth in the past year ortwo. Even to the ranks of the professional aviators there have been fewadditions. The big prizes that wereat first offered at aviation meets arenot so numerous. The barnstormingbirdman, who managed to pick up considerably more than a living by givingexhibition flights and braving death,finds himself a lesser attraction thanformerly.As to the amateur aviators, engaging in. the SDort for the pure love of it,there are so few of . them, in thiscountry at least, that they are hardlyworth mentioning. A flight or twousually suffices the boldest of them.It they land safely they declare thatflying is the most wonderful sensationimaginable but they delay putting intheir orders for biplanes or monojplanes.The aeroplane manufacturing industry may yet be plared on a firm andprofitable basis, but the experimentswill have to go much farther and accomplish a great deal more than they'have yet 'succeeded in accomplishingbefore the business will .yield manylarge fortunes.Gaining in Strength..-We offer every convenience toiJourDepositors.3 per cent, interest paidonTimeEepositstfte HgnculmraljBank of ParisMillions Saved.Three million dollars is to be thesaving to the people of the country asthe result of the fact that Congressman Ben Johnson, of Kentucky isChairman of the House Committee onthe District of Columbia and, until hebegan to make a fight in Congress theydid not know it. Even some of themembers of Congress did not know it.The practice of the. governmentstanding one half of the taxes'for residents ot the District of Columbia anold one. It has been going7"on forjears.

The old policyoi the government to stand one halfof the taxes makes Washington a fineplace for'tax dodging millionaires tobuild ther paUces. It might only neexpected that when Mt'.l Johnson began his fight pressure would bebrought to bear on him to force himto abandon it.3 It was the great newspapers of Washington flayed nim andridiculed him; 'The Senate set itselfun against him, he was opposed on thtfloor of the House, and he had to fight;and fight hard, for every inch of headway he made. v .But Mr. Johnson took the attitudelat hewas sent to Congress to serveWherever former Governor Beckham goes he is greeted with the "gladhand." The candidate for UnitedStates Senator to succeed SenatorBradley is'creating an irnpression thatis doubling the strength of his candidacy and every place he visits invariably a warm'reception is the result.From the neighboring county ofScott comes a report that the formerGovernor paid a visit to the capital ofthe county and as evidenced by the enthusiasm of the voters he has gaineda decided advantage over his opponent,-Mr. Stanley. The news story says:"Former Governor Beckham was inthis city yesterday in the interest ofhis candidacy for the United StatesSanate. He was given a most cordialreception by the Democrats of Scottcounty and received the greatest encouragement. "From the expressions of the Democrats of Georgetown it is evident thatGovernor Beckham s a decided favorite over Conrgessman Stanley in thiscounty in the Senatorial race, and hewill undoubtedly carry Scott county inthe primary by a large majority."The Georgetown News this mornine says editorially that there is noquestion of the former Governor beingable to sweep the country.".

A year or two ago' a woman inIowa. Mrs. Mary T. Watts, conceivedthe idea thac in her state the principalenthusiasm among the people was forbetter cattle, better porn, better hogsand all that sort of thing. At all thecounty and state fairs there had beenoccasional baby shows, but the wholepurpose of them was to pick out andreward babies for their beauty and attractiveness rather than for theirhealth and development. In otherwords the baby was simply a sideshowfor entertanment, and not taken seriously, while in evpry other exhibit orcontest science ruled and the objpetwas to cultivate among the peopleknowledge of the best ways to producebetter products.Mrs. Watts saw that Iowa was neglecting her most valuable crop hercrop of babies. With the co-operationof a physcian. Dr. M. V. Clark, sheorganized a real baby contest. Theobject was to award prizes to thosewhich made the best physical showing.Doctor Clark prepared score cards,the piincipal items of which wereadapted from the cards used in judging cattle and animals of variouskinds. These cards formed the basisof u scientific inquiry calculated to reveal the strength and physical andmental efficiency of the child examined. The results of this firstcontest were appalling. They showedthat Iowa had better corn and cattlethan babies, and wakened public sentiment to wider study of all those matters that concern the children dier,clothes, baths. One child who had received a low marking in the first contest won a prize at the second becausethe mother had carried out the suggestions as to the child's diet and'earewhich she never would have heard ofhad it not been for the aroused stateof the public mind.This year many states are going tohave scientific baby shows in connection with live stock shows and siatefairs. Women's clubs, newspapers andphysicians are awake and one of themost important world movements hasbegun.SkVaSiourbon Sarate 6c Supply Co,TK, -l'AUTOMOBILESSupplies of All Kinds, Repairing, Etc.tSourbon Sararge $ Supply Co.I C.IPool Contract is Upheld.Pooling agreements between tobaccogrowers and tneir association, eventhoghcontaining a provision for liquidatea damages, are enforceable inequity, and their violations may be enjoined, said the Court of Appeals, reversing the Fayette Circuit Court inthe case of the Grant County Board ofControl and Burley Tobacc-i Societyvs. A. S. Allahinn, who, it was alleged, had shipped his crop to Lexington for sale aftr pooling it. 'The pooling contract contained thisprovision on tne part of the poolers :"Upon our failure to fully complywith the terms of this contract wehereby agree to pay to said society asliquidated damages 20 per cent of thevalue of said tobacco."The court said it is a new questionwhether a court of equity may enjoina breach of contract, notwithstandingthe piovision for specific damagestherefor, and held the test to bewhether it was the intention that thecontract be fulfilled or that the partyshould have the option to keep it ornay the damages. In this case, thecourt held that the damages specifiedwere intended to be security for performance, bpcause the very life of theenterprise on which they were engageddepended upon the poolers fulfillingtheir contract and selling through thenool.C.
