Its author andmanager. Mr. Fred Raymond, feelsjustly proud of its unbounded successas a work of dramatic art. years ofpopular favor, and wonderful drawingpowers. It is a faithful picture ofAmerican country life, with a healthful and invigorating atmosphere. Inthe construction of this truly successful play Mr. Raymond has given to theAmerican stage two character delineations, "Zeke" and "Daisy," whichstand alone as laugh producers, andone wonders at the unadulterated simplicity which characterizes those twoexcruciatingly funny creations; butthe play has also its serious side oflife, wnich brings into action an exceptionally strong company of artists."The Missouri Girl" is remarkable forthe attention which is given to the details in the elaborate settings und accessoriep giving the play a most realistic effect. During the action of theplay novel musical numbers, songs anddances are introduced. The oftener thepublic see "The Missouri Girl," theoftener they want to see it. It is undoubtedly the greatest self-advertisingplay on the American stage today.That is the reason why it has beensepn by millions of the theatre-goersduring its years before the puhlic. Itpleases all classes; hence its unprecedented success. "The Missouri Girl"will.be at the Paris Grand next Tuesday. Attention Gardeners.Garden seeds both in package andbulk just received.

Efforts toconserve the soil fertility of llinoiswhich a committee of the bankers' association of Illinois hasundertaken as aresult of the earnings of the state university that depletion was going on almost unchecked, has a big futurestake, according to Ur. J. Paul Goode,of Chicago, who has asserted that ifthe soil is conserve the Mississippivalley will have a population of 200,000,000 to 300.000,000 before the century ends. Wisconsin took the lead inefforts to prevent soil impoverishmentand now the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan willunite in the efforts in a common cause.Dr. Cyril W. Hopkins, dean of thestate agricultural school, warned thebankers when in convention that something must be done soon in soil restoration. Not only is that to be done,but the committee, of which W. G.Edens. ot Chicago, is secretary, alsohas recommended efforts to inspire thechildren of farmers with a new respect, interest and love for farmwork. The committee's first report includes this declaration: "We feelthat a system of schools supported bypublic expense, can ibetter justify itself by the further incorporation ofagricultural and vocational educationin its curriculum; that the countryschools in particular can be mademuch more helpful tin the matter ofagricultural education and in increasing the interest of the children in thatgreatest and must necessary of all professions, the profession of agriculture,and to this extent at least, we gladlyendorse the report of the EducationalCommission of this state."Red-headed girls are preferred forwaiters in Chicago, at least one cafemanager gives them preference, because, he says, they attract patronage.He is the manager of one of the restaurant concerns which has lunchcounters scattered all over th? downtown district, and ought to know whathe is talking about. "Red-haired girlsI find are pleasing to customers theylike to look upon a head of flaminghair while they eat," he said. "Arestaurant with none but red-headedgirls would become fajioua. Peoplewould come blocks to dine there.":Girl waiters with hlond and black hairare looking up lotions to dye it red,and some of them are thinking ofwigs, Other restaurants have decidedpreferences either ioc colored waitersor foreigners of a specified nationality rbut the waiters' union has barred frommost of the downtown cafes the colored waiters, who a few years ago werealtogether in the majority.The crowded tenements of Chicagocosts the city millions of dollars eachyear through the resulting inefficiency,dependency, inebriety, juvenile delinquency, crime and mortality in diaseases, according to Charles B. Ball,chief sanitary inspector of Chicago."I have found a room so dark that onecould not distinguish the presence of apreson three feet a'ay," he said,"and women work in those rooms. Inone kitchen I found a woman at workwhere it was necessary to keep alamp lighted to enable her to see whatshe was doing." JAvaricious landlordsare charged with responsibility for theconditions and an effort has been madeto enlist business men in a generalmovement to improve the housing inthe poorer districts of the town asyears ago they were improved in NewYork. The effect of tenement life onthe future citizens was cited by Prof.James H Tults, who said: "The children pass six hoars of the day in theschool room, buckin the remaining 18hours they work or sleep in darkenedrooms, basements or hovels, and theyplay in places unfit for them. Conidtions are no less than frightful yet itwould appear that the public, inChicago is satisfied if the schoolfroomsare kept clean and ventilated."An income of $1,000 a year is enoughto support a man and his wife, andenable tnem to save $500, according toHarlow N. Higginbotham, of Chicago,who made a iortune as a partner ofMarshall Field. This is the way hefigures it: "It costs a person for foodjust about 24 cents a day," he said,"and I can prove it costs no more tolive coday than it did three or fouryears ago. Now, 365figure mentioned Ogivesthe cost of food for oneyear, provided one doesdays at theus 87.60 forperson for anut waste it,or throw it away. A man and his wifedo not need a servant, and an apartment quite large enough for two peopleand with a room to spare, will cost say$24.00 a month. Then add light andgas and I believe two people could liveeconomically and save $500 a year.Here is what one woman did 'on $6 aweek : After a series of years thatwoman bad in the bank the sum of$2,715.81, and moreover had helped herbrother to the extent of $300. Thus onan income of $312 a year, she had asved $3,272.41, had maintained herselfand been to the hospital once and paida doctor's bill. 1 started to workfor Marshall Field after ithe war for '$1,200, which the next year was Taised 'NO. 320 MAIN STREET.- Editor and OwnerSIX MONTHSAdvance$1.00to $2,000, the next to 4.000 and itwent up in time until I was earning$200,000 a year. I never asked foi anincrease and the 'man who is alwaysbegging for more money is generallythe man who has no right to it." Air.Higginbotham never made much of arecord as a spender himself.Transportation as a science and thevalue of harbors to shippers are subjects Chicago is accused of knowingmighty little about, this being !theopinion of Lieutenant Colonel Zinngovernment engineer in carge, who hastried to get enough facts to buttressa report favorable to harbor improvements "I have been trying to get information to embody in my report toSecretary of War Dickinson," he said,"but I have yet to meet the man whocan tell me what I want to know.Chicago shippers do not seem to understand even the oasic principles cf thescience of transportation. When theroads make an effort to increasefreight rates there is a universal bowelof protest from the shippers, who, ifthey only had sense enough to know it,could save themselves substantialamounts by routing goods themselvesoccasionally. The people I have metcan't tell me why they want a harbur,or what advantage it would be to thecity. Some of the larger shippersseem to have a hazy idea, but othershaven't even that." LieutenantColonel Zinn said he had welldefined views on the harbor question,but declined to air them before forwarding his report to Washington.Bristow Will Accept.Judge L. L. Bristow, of Georgetown, who has been tipped as the successor of Judge H. C. Howard as district chairman of the Republican Committee of the Seventh Congressionaldistrict, stated that while he was not acandidate for the position and had notsought the honor, yet it was true thata majority of the chairmen of the eightcounties of the district had writtenurging him to accept the place and badpledged their support. In view of thisJudge Bristow frankly admitted thathe would feel it to be his duty not todecline the chairmanship if tenderedhim next Saturday.To Prosecute Claim.The Rev. G. W. Latham, of Hopkinsville, is in Washington to presenta claim for $550 against the Government for his blacksmith shop whichwas confiscated by the Federal troopsduring the Civil War. Mr. Lathamoperated the shop in Hopkinvsille atthat period and it was held and usedtwo years by soldiers camped in andaround the city. The Rev. Mr. Latham is said to be the oldest ministerin the state who is still preaching.He is eighty-seven years of age, andhas been in the pulpit si txy-nine years.He has received in the church 26,885members, preached 1,256 funerals andmarried 1,807 couples.

If the germ could be magnifiedto a size equal to its terrors it would appear moreterrible than any fire-breathing dragon. Germscan't be avoided. They are in the air we breathe,the water we drink.The germ can only prosper when the conditionof the system gives it free scope to establish itself and develop. When there is a deficiency ofvital force, languor, restlessness, a sallow cheek,n hollow eye, when the appetite 13 poor and thesleep is broken, it i3 time to guard against the germ. You canfortify the body against all germs by the use cf Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery. It increases the vital power, cleanses thesystem of clogging impurities, enriches the blood, puts the stomach and organs of digestion and nutrition in working condition, sothat the germ finds no weak or tainted spot in which to breed."Golden Medical Discovery" contains no alcohol, whisky orhabit-forming drugs.

Thewomen there have learned well how tomake the best use of their opportunities with the least exertion. How theyusa the tourists every one who hastraveled in the country of the Alpsknows. They also know how to makenature do their housework.In most of the towns everything thatis washed or cleaned is washed orcleaned in one of the big wateringtroughs that stand at regular intervalsalong the main thoroughfares. Into itgoes everything from potatoes to human beings, and the only sanitaryregulation existent is that it must becleaned out with a large broom madeof bush or twigs after the potatoeshave had their bath. But when itrains then everything else gives wayto the family wash, no matter if it isThursday or Sunday or Saturday orWednesday, for in Switzerland theyseek the rainy days for wash days, Instead of deploring a cloudy Monday.The steady downpour provides running water in the village washtub.Into the sweeping current the familylinen goes, and there it is whirled andtwirled about until every speck of dirtis thoroughly rinsed away. The scrubbing board is not put into commissionat all. Occasionally the good housewife,protected under the family umbrellaheld over her bead by one of heryoungsters, who is allowed te enjoythe drips from that same umbrella,takes a look at her wash and encourages it with a gentle poke with herhusband's best cane. But the rest ofthe day she enjoys to the full in hersnug elm let. while the elements do herwork. In fact, with her conscience atrest that her day's tasks will be done,she can spend her time gossiping withher neighbor, whose conscience is alsoat peace.On the next day the wash goesthrough a process of bluing and starchingall in that same basin and finally, when the sun shines, it is laidout on the wonderful green grass ofthe Swiss matten and is there bleached to a snowy whiteness. If the glaciers and the landslides were to accommodate her by rolling down overher wash and ironing it out withoutsoiling the Swiss housewife would notbe at all surprised. In fact, it is notto be doubted that she now regards asan oversight the failure of Dame Nature to provide an ironing board. NewYork Post.LOST HIS LINEN JOB.The Salesman Who Made a Caricatureof A. T.

"Justsent him to me, will you?"A little later a slim youth enteredMr. Stewart's private office and saidhe understood he "had been sent for."Yes," said Mr. Stewart gravely and.holding up the sketch asked, "Did youdo this?"The lad grew pale and stammered:"I beg your pardon, sir; it was onlya bit of fun. I meant no offense.""That's all very well, but you'll haveto give up your job here."The youth humbly "protested, whenMr. Stewart burst out laughing andsaid: "Don't say any more, my boy.I'm only joking. Your sketch is excellent, and as it would be a sin to keepa man of your artistic talontjjehind alinen counter I propose to supply youwith the means to study art."Mr. Stewart's proposition was gratefully accepted, and it was thus thatJohn II.

Irish, the goldentongued orator, and Judge Kinne ofWaterloo, la., the man with lungs ofbrass, were stumping Iowa in behalf ofthe Democratic candidate.They were driving in a buggy on theroad to Sidney, a young city in thesouthwestern part of the state, whenthey came to a fork of the road wherethere was no sign board. Which turnto take was a question, as they hadbarely time to make the town anyway."There's a farmhouse over there abit. You sit still, and I'll go over andask questions," said Irish, and. climbing out, he started for the desired In- iformation. He got It and on his return saw the horse, evidently fright-'ened at something, tearing down the'road at runaway speed. Instead of trying to stop the horse, Judge Kinnedropped the reins, climbed over theseat and dropped off the back of thebuggy into the road. IWhen Irish caught up to him thejudge was busily dusting himself off 1after his roll in the roadway, not in Ithe least disfigured by his acrobatic 1stunt.,4You're on the right fork of the road, 'all right, judge, but why didn't youhang on to the horse?" asked Irish,laughing heartily."Why didn't I hang on to him?"rumbled Kinne in his deep subcellarvoice.

That being considered, the question of moment was how to pose Katusha.Rolled into a ball every cat lookslike every other cat; hence it was Katusha in action that must grace theforeground. Being abominably coddled and fat. action wjjb the last thingthat appealed to Katusha. Coaxingand likewise prodding made no effect.She had been known upon occasionsto be stirred by a morsel of delectablefood. But fancy an aristocratic felinepictured in the attitude of tearing at achicken bone! Impossible for Katusha. There arose an emergency and withit the mistress, who disappeared intothe house and brought forth a branchof Japanese raper cherry blossoms. Awave of them before Katusha's eyeswas like making some hypnotic pass.She got up, stretched her body, whileher nose just reached the pinkish flowers. That was it! They appealed toher acstheticism.Snap went the camera. It was perfect.

Depot Opposite Old SiteMillersburg News.Declaring that the city of Millersburg could not hope from the presentassessment of the town property toreap any benefits in the form of publicimprovements, Mr. F. P. Hurst,Chairman of the City Board of Supervisors, addressed the Board at theregular meeting of the City CouncilWednesday evening, when the reportof the Board was submitted to thatbody, and urged an increase in the assessment of the taxable property inthe years to come to meet the publicrequirements.In the course of his address beforethe Board Mr. Hurst discussed the assessment of the city, stating that atthe present time it was entirely toolow, and if the people of the town expected to be able to come into possession of the improvements that meanso much to a town the assessmentsnould be incraesed.He showed that a greater part ofthe taxable property in Milleraburgwas assetsed at one-third of its valueand some even less, while there wasvery little which was assessed as muchas fifty per cent of its value. He saidif the town property was put upon theproper basis the rata of fixationwould not have to be increased 10 install such improvements as a waterworks plant, but to require an assessment of the property at two-thirds ofitR reasonable value, would accordingto his estimate, put a sum in excess of52,500 extra in the city treausry annually, most all of which could be setaside as a fund with which to install awater system.As it is beyond the power of thetown council to make a bonded indebtedness of more than $6,000, Mr. Hrustis of the opinion that in connectionwith this and the funds realized from aproper assessment, a sufficient amountcould, within a few years, be accumulated with which to install a perfectsystem of water-works.
