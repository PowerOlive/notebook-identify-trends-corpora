It became effective at 5:03 p. m. Friday, whenit was signed by the Executive without formality. 1After but one hours' debate, theresolution was unanimously adoptedby the Senate with an affirmativevote of 74. It was approved by theHouse 363 to 1, Representative London, the Kew York Socialist, cast-iing the only dissenting vote. A fewminutes later Vice President Mar-,shall and Speaker Clark had signed the document and sent it to theWhite House, where President Wil-1son attached his signature withSecretary Tumulty and AssistantSecretary Forster as the only witnesses. In accord with the President'ssuggestion, action in respect to Turkey and Bulgaria, Germany's other fallies, was left to the future. Widespread demand in Congress for theirinclusion in the declaration was indicated in both Senate and Housedebate, but when the roll calls camethe President's advice was followedin a demonstration of Americanunity and harmony.3 b P3ber will be Miss Buckley, reader,who will appear m a selected program of artistic numbers on Thursday evening, December 18, at theParis High School Auditorium.fe ?S3 J51WE HAVE IT.Xmas Jewelry we havethe goods.
