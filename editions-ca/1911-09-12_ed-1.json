Good Record for Odd Fellow.
If the following be correct, and it
should be, coming as it ,does from
"TheKentucky Odd Fellows,"it speaks
mighty well for the Odd Fellows' order
in Adams county, Ohio, and whatever
is true of the order in that county is
evidently true everywhere. "The
Older of Odd Fellows has a light 10
feel proud of their organization, since
it has been learned that out of 856
members in Adams county pollirg
5,400 votes, nearly 2,100 of whom are
disfranchised, not a single Odd Fellow
was indicted for selling his vote. This
fact has been revealed by Grand
Master Hoffman who has just finished
making an investigation."
