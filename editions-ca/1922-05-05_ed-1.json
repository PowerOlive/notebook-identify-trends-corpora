FORD KIDWELL
Announcement has been made
of the engagement of Miss Mary
Etta Ford, of Sharpstown, Maryland,
to Mr. Robert Kidwell, of Washing
ton, D. C. The marriage will be a
distinct social event of the near fu
ture. Miss Ford is a daughter of
Mr. James Edward Ford, a niece of
the Misses Ford, of Paris, whom she
has frequently visited, and is a for
mer student of the Paris High
School.
A cair for school warrants, of
which there are approximately $500
000 worth now outstanding will be
made within a few weeks. The State
treasury at the close of business Sat
urday held $504, 48-6. 31 to the credit
of the State School JFund, and no
payments are to be made to the
counties until next fall.
Money in the State "treasury at
the close of business totalled $1,-
138,837.88, and there were out
standing $4, 126, 807. 28. worth, .of
State warrants. The school fund
made-up almost half of the sum in
the treasury, with the fund for gen
eral State expenses second, with
$462,799.48. The sinking fund
contained $102,159.52; the State
University fund, $1,837.01; the State
road fund, $66,243.43; the Eastern
Normal School fund. $656.07, and"
the Western State Normal School
fund $656.07.
Good, old fashioned moralists used
to have a precept, "never . destroy
that which you cannot replace."
The application was usually made to
the taking of life, and probably did
some good in a humane way.
But the saying would be worth
considering economically The peo
ple of the United States have been
pretty prodigal with natural re
sources which either they can not re
place easily or which they can not
replace at all. They wasted their
forests and left their vast areas of
formerly wooded land a pitiful bar
ren, the annual prey of fire. They
could have replaced theforests, but
they didn't.
And now, according to the reports
of the geological experts, they are
reaching the end of the oil supply.
At the same -time they are making
the greater part .of their industrial
and economic structure daily more
dependent upo'n petroleum and its
products.
In view of this the opposition to
the proposed reduction $f navy fuel
oil consumption seems rather ab
surd. The saving' proposed directly
by reduction in the appropriation
amounts to $6,000,000,. not an" in-
I significant sum. But the greater
importance of the proposal lies in
conservation of the oil supply. '
The world applauded when Secre-
tary Hughes proposed scrapping a lot
of big ships. It is quite in line with
that to stop wasting the world's oil "
supply under the boilers of fighting
ships. The supply is limited. It can
never be replaced. It would be fine
business for another world confer
ence to restrict by agreement the
ruthless waste of oil inv ships of use
only in case of war.
