Backache is only a simple thing at
first;
But if you find it is from the kid
neys; That serious kidney troubles may
follow;
That dropsy or Bright's disease may
be the fatal end,
You will be glad to know the follow
ing experience.

Lillie Colson, Paint Lick, Ky., says:
For five years I had kidney trouble.
I suffered from pains in the small of
th back, and when I stooped or lift
ed, sharp twinges darted through me.
My back ached at night and in the
morning I was lame.I became easily
tired and was nervous. Headaches
and dizzy spells were common. My
body bloated as if I had dropsy.I fi
nally began using Doan's Kidney Pills
and two poxes greatiy r lieved me. I
intend to continue using this remedy
until I am cured."
