Developments indicate that the

ciation is planning to secure entire
control of the Lexington loose leaf
market. The association had made
overtures to the Fayette Tobacco
Warehouse Company, of that city the
only one of the warehouses lefc out
6f the combine, with the view to ac
quiring that plant also.
None of the ofiieers jr stockholders
are discussing the matter, but from
an absolutely trustworthy source it
was learned that a proposition to buy
was made. With the acquisition of
this house the Louisville association
will have entire control of the Lex
ington market. It is said to be the
purpose of the Louisville association
when the deal is fuliy consummated
to organize a big holding company to
finance and control the merger, issu
ing preferred and common stock to
cover its holdings.
Just what the capitalization of the
holding company will t.e has not yet
been determined, but it will be not
less than $1,000,000.
