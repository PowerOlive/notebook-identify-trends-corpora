Kenyon sat down andthought over what young- Long worthhad told him His triumph after allhad been short lived The choice between the two scoundrels was so smallthat he felt he didnt care which ofthem owned the mine Meditating uponthis disagreeable subject he suddenlyremembered a request he had askedWentworth to make to the new ownerof the mine He wanted no favor fromMelville so he wrote a second lettercontradicting the request made in thefirst and after posting it returnedtc his hotel and went to bed probablythe most tired man In the city of OttawaCHAPTER XXVIIThis chapter consists largely of letters As a general thing letters are oflittle concern to anyone except thewriters and the receivers but they areinserted here under the hope that thereader is already well enough acquainted with the correspondents to feel someinterest in what they have writtenIt was nearly a fortnight after thereceipt of the cablegram from Kenyonthat George Wentworth found onemorning on his desk two letters eachbearing a Canadian postage stampOne was somewhat bullcy and one wasthin but they were both from the sameWriter He tore open the thin one firstwithout Jodkinv at the date that wasstamped upon it He was a little bewildered by its contents which ran asfollowsMy Dear George I have just heardthat Melville is the man who has boughtthe mine The circumstances of the caseleave no doubt in my mind that such is thefact therefore please disregard the request I made as to employment in the letter I posted to you a short time ago I feela certain sense of disappointment In thefact that Melville is the owner of the mineIt seems I have only kept one rascal fromiying it to put it in the hands of anotherrascal Your friend John KentonMelville the owner eried Wentworth to himself Whatever couldhave lint that into Johns head ThisLitter is evidently the one posted a fewhours before so it will contain whatever request he has to make and without delay George Wentworth tore openthe envelope of ihe second letter whichwas obviously the one written first Itcontained a number of documents relating to the transfer of the mine Theletter from John himself went on togive particulars of the buying of themine Then it continued I wish youwould do me a favor George Will youkindly ask the owner of the mine if hewill give me charge of it I am ofcourse anxious to make it turn out aswell as possible and I believe I canmore than earn my salary whateverit is You know I am not grasjnnginthe matter of monej but get me aslarge a salary as you think I deserve1 desire to make money for reasonsthat are not entire selfish as youknow To tell you the truth GeorgeI am tired of cities and of people Jwant to live here in the woods wherethere is not so much deceit and treachery as there seems to be in the bigtowns When X reached London lasttime I felt like a boy getting home Mjfeelings have undergone a completechange and I think if it were not fory en and a certain young lady I shouldnever care to see the big city againWhat is the use of my affecting mysteryand writing the words 4a certain younglady Of course you know whom Lmean Miss Edith Longworth Youknow also that I am and have longbeen in love with her If I had- ceeded in making the money I thoughtT should by selling the mine I mighthave had some hopes of making moreand of ultimately being in a position toask her to be my wife But that andvery many other hopes have disappeared with my recent London experiencesI want to get into the woods and recover some of my lost tone and mylost faith in human nature If you canarrange matters with the owner of themine so that I may stay here for a yearor two you will do mea great favorGeorge Wentworth read over the latter part of this letter two or three timesThen he rose paced the floor and pondered over the matter It isnt a thingupon which I can ask anyones advicehe muttered to himself The troublewith Kenyon is he is entirely too modest A little useful self esteem wouldbt just the thing for him At last hestopped suddenly in his walk ByJove he said to himself slapping histhigh I shall do it let the8 Jqaences be what they may And hesat down to his desk and wrote a letterMy Dear Miss Longworth 5Tou toldrne when you were here last that youwanted all the documents in the case othe mine in every instance A documenthas come this morning that is rather important John Kenyon as you will learnby reading the letter desires the managership of the mine I need not say thatI think he is the best man in the world foithe position and that everything will besafe in his hands I therefore inclose youhis letter I had some thought of cuttingout some part of it but knowing your de-sire as you said to have all the documents in the case I take the liberty ofsending this one exactly as it reached meand if anyone is to blame I am the personI remain your agent vGeorge WentworthHe sent this letter out at once sothat he would not have a chance tochange his mind It will reach herthis afternoon and doubtless she willcall and see meIt is perhaps hardly necessary to as3rshe did not call and she did not seehim for many days afterward but nextmorning when he came to his office hefound a letter from her It ranDear Mr Wentworth The sendingof Mr Kenyon3 letter to me is a somewhat dangerous precedent which youmust on no account follow by sendingany letters you may receive from any person to Mr Kenyon However as youwere probably aware wnen you sent tneletter no blame will rest on your shouldersor on those of anyone else in this instanceStill be very careful in future becauseletter sending unabridged is sometimesa risky thing to do All the same you areto remember that I always want all thedocuments in the case and I want themwith nothing eliminated I am very muchobliged to you for forwarding me the letterAs to the managership of the mine ofcourse I thought Mr Kenyon would desireto come back to London If he is contentto stay abroad and really wants to staythere I wish you would tell him that MrSmith is exceedingly pleased to know heis willing to take charge of the mine Itwould not look businesslike on the part ofMr Smith to say he is to name his ownsalary but unfortunately Mr Smith isvery ignorant as to what a proper salaryshould be so will you kindly settle thatquestion You know the usual salary forsuch an occupation Please write downthat figure and add 5200 a year to it TellMr Kenyon the amount named is the salary Mr Smith assigns to himPray be very careful in the wording ofthe letters so that Mr Kenyon will nothave any idea who Mr Smith is Tourstruly Edith LongworthWhen Wentwortih received this letterbeing a man he did not know whetherMiss Longworth was pleased or notHowever he speedily wrote to Johntelling him he was appointed managerof the mine and that Mr Smith wasvery pleased to have him in that capacity He named the salary but said ifit was not enough no doubt Mr Smithwas so anxious for his services that theamount would be increasedJohn when he got the letter wasmore than satisfiedAt the same time Wentworth hadbeen reading his letters John had received those which had been sent himwhen the mine was bought He was relieved to find that Melville was notafter all the owner and he went towork with a will intending to put intwo or three years of his life with hardlabor in developing the resources of thepropertyi The first fortnight beforehe received any letters he did nothiDgbut niake himself acquainted with theway work was being carried on thereHe found many things to improve Themachinery had been allowed to rundown and the men worked in the listless way men do when they are underno particular supervision The manager of the mine was very anxiousabout his position John told him theproperty had changed hands but untilhe had further news from Englandhe could not tel just what would bedone When the letters came Johntook hold with a vim and there was soona decided improvement in the way affairs were going He allowed the oldmanager to remain as a sort of submanager but that individual soon foundout the easy times of the Austrian Mining company were forever goneKenyon had to take one or two longtrips in Canada and the United Statesto arrange for the disposal of the products of the mine but as a general rutehis time was spent entirely in the logvillage near the river When a yearhad passed he was able to write a veryjubilant letter to Wentworth Yousee he said after all the mine wasworth the 200000 we asked for it Itpays even the first year ten per cent-on that amount This will give backall the mine has cost and I thinkGeorge the honest thing for us to dowould be to let the whole proceeds goto Mr Smith this year wTho advancedthe money at a critical time This willrecoup him for his own outlay becausethe working capital has not beentouched The mica has more thanpaid the working of the mine and allthe rest is clear profit Therefore ifvou are willing we will let our thirdgo this year and then we can take ourlarge dividend next year with a clearconscience I inclose the balance sheetTo this letter there came an answerin due time from Wentworth who saidthat he had placed Johns proposal before Mr Smith but it seemed the gentleman was so pleased with the profitable investment he had made that hewould hear of no other division of theprofits but that of share and share alikeHe appeared to be very much touchedby the offer John had made and respected him for making it but the proposed rescinding on his part and Wentworths was a thing not to be thoughtof This being the case John sent a letter and a very large check to his fatherThe moment of posting that letter wasdoubtless one of the happiest of his lifeaud this ends the formidable1 array ofletters which appears in this chapterCHAPTER XXVmKenyons luck as he said to himselfhad turned The second year was evenmore prosperous than the first andthe third as successful as the secondHe had a steady market for his mineraland besides he had the great advantageof knowing the rogues to avoid Somenew swindles he had encountered during his first years v experience hadtaught him lessons tiiat he profited byin the second and third He liked hishome in the wilderness and he liked theTHE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY FEBRUARY 2 1897rough people among whom he foundhimselfNotwithstanding his renunciation otLondon however there would now andthen come a yearning for the big cityand he promised himself a trip there atthe end of the third v ear Wentworthhad been threatening month aftermonth to come out and see him butsomething had always interferedTaking it all in all John liked it better in winter than in the summer inspite of the extreme cold The coldwas steady and could be depended uponf moreover it was healthful and invigorating In summer Johnnever became accustomed to the ravages of the black fly the mosquito andother insect pests of that season Hisfirst interview with the black fly lefthis face in such a condition that he wasglad he lived in a wildernessAt the beginning of the second winter John treated himself to a luxuryHe bought a natty little French Canadian horse that wasvery quick and accustomed to the ice because the ice oLthe river formed the highway by whichhe reached Burntpine from the mineTo supplement the horse he also gota comfortable little cutter and withthis turnout he made his frequent journeys between the mine and Burntpinewith comfort and speed wrappedsnugly in buffalo robesII London often reverted to his mindthere was another subject that obtruded itself even more frequently Hisincreased prosperity had something todo with this He saw that if he wasto have a third of the receipts of themine he was not to remain a poor manfor very long and this fact gave him acertain courage which had been lackingbefore He wondered if she remembered him Wentworth had said verylittle about her in his letters and Kenyon in spite of the confession he hadmade when his case seemed hopelesswas loth to write and ask his friend anything about herOne day on a clear sharp frostywinter morning Kenyon had his littlepony harnessed for his weekly journeyto Burntpipe After the rougher partof the journey between the mine andthe river had been left behind and thepony got down to her work on the icewith the two white banks of snow oneither side of the smooth track Johngave himself up to thinking about thesubject which now so often engrossedhis mind Wrapped closely in his f urswith the cutter skimming along the icethese thoughts found a pleasant accompaniment in the silvery tinkle of thebells which jingled around his horsesneck As a general thing he met noone on the icy road from the mine to thevillage Sometimes there was a precession of sleighs bearing supplies forhis own mine and those beyond andwhen this procession was seen Kenyon had to look out for some place bythe side of the track where he couldpull up his horse and cutter and allcwthe teams to pass The snow on eachside of the cutting wras so deep thatthese bays were shoveled outJiereandJthere to permit teams to get past eachother He had gone half way to thevillage when he saw ahead of him apair of horses which he at onceThere -wereno witnesses onhillsnized as thosethe white toppedbelonsrincr to the hotelkeeper He drew up in the first bay andawaited the approach of the sleigh Hesaw that it contained visitors for himself because the driver on recognizinghim had turned round and spoken tothe occupants of the vehicle As it camealong the man drew up and noddedto Kenydn who although ordinarily themost polite of men did not return thesalutation He was stricken dumb withastonishment at seeing who was in thesleigh One woman was so bundled upthat not even her nose appeared outin the cold but the smiling rosy faceof the other needed no introduction toJohn KenyonWell Mr Ivenyon cried a laughingvoice you did not expect to see niethis morning did youI confess I did not said John andyet here he paused He was going tosay and yet I was thinking of youbut he checked himselfMiss Longworth who had a talentfor reading the unspoken thoughts ofJohn Kenyon probably did not need tobe told the end of the sentence Arevou going to the village she askedI was goingI am not going nowThats right I was justgoing toinvite you to turn round with us Yousee we are on our way to look at themine and I suppose we shall have toobtain the consent of the manager before we can do so Miss Longworthscompanion had emerged for a momentfrom her wraps and looked at Johnbut instantly retired among the fursagain with a shiver She was not scyoung as her companion and she considered this the most frightful climateshe had ever encounteredNow said John although yoursleigh is very comfortable I think thiscutter of mine is even more so It isIntended or two Wont you step outof the sjeigh into the cutter Thenif the driver willmove on I can turnand we will follow the sleighI shall be delighted to do so saidthe young woman shaking herself freefrom the buffalo robe and steppinglightly from the sleigh to the cutterpausing however for a moment before she did so to put her own wrapsover her companion John tucked herin beside himself and as the sleighjingled on he slowly turned his ponyround into the road again I have gota pretty fast pony he said but Ithink Ave will let them drive on aheadIt irritates this little horse to see anything in front of herThen we can make up speed saidEdith and catch them before theyget to the mine Is it far from here -No not very far at least it doesnttake long to get there with a smarthorseI have enjoyed this experience everso much she said You see my father had come to Montreal on businessSo I came with him as usual and being there I thought I would run uphereand see the mine I wanted shecontinued looking at the other side ofthe cutter and trailing her well glovedfingers in the snow I wanted to knowpersonally whether my manager wasconducting my property in the way itought to be conducted notwithstanding the very satisfactory balance sheetshe sendsYour property exclaimed John inamazementCertainly You didnt know that didyou she replied looking for a moment at him and then away from himI call myself the Mistress of the MineThen you are you areMr Smith said the girl coming tohis rescueThere was a moments rjause and thenext

thathave been matured have already received so much attention and commendation from the press of the whelecountry that the success of the enterprise is already assured It has neverbeen intended by the people of Tennessee that this patriotic celebration of theone hundredth anniversary of theirstate should be merely of a local or sectional interest but it is only recentlythat the full importance and broadscope of the exposition has been moregenerally understood and accepted asa national or international event Infact while the plans grounds and buildings are just what the managementoriginally contemplated they find thatthe demands for space and privilegesalready exceed the capacity of thebuildings and the lively interest whichhas been created especially since theclose of the late political campaign isan indication of the greater interestthat will be felt everywhere when theexposition opensSeveral of the states have made appropriations for displays and manyothers will do so in the

the barnit presented to their eyes its usual appearance solemn rather mystic in theblack night The Swedes lantern wasoverturned at a point someyards fromin front of the barn doors It containeda wild little conflagration of its ownand even in their excitement some ofthose who ran felt a gentle secondary vibration of the thrifty part of theirminds at sight of this overturned lantern Under ordinary

was runningdown the decline and around to the basement of the barn where were thestanchions of cows Some one noticedat the time that he ran very lamely asif one of the frenzied horses hadsmashed his

He shrieked like one lost ashe went under the cows hoofs and themilk pail rolling across the floor madea flash of silver in the gloomOld Fleming took a fork beat off thecow and dragged the paralized Swedeto the open air When they had rescued all the cows save one which hadso fastened herself that she could notbe moved an inch they returned to thefront of the barn and stood sadlybreathing like men who had reachedthe final point of human effortMany people had come runningSome one had even gone to the churchand now from the distance rang thetocsin note of the old bell There was along flare of crimson on the sky whichmade remote people speculate as to thewhereabouts of the fireThe long flames sang their drummingchorus in voices of the heaviest bassThe wind whirled clouds of smoke andcinders

Caucasians dining on saltedXetrels and with a relish too as thoughthat fish eating sea bird were a luxuryOf all the fowl that haunt the barretislands on the California coast none isconsidered quite so worthless as thesooty petrel Even the seagull has hisusefulness as a scavenger on the baysalong the coast but the petrel is truly adespised bird in these waters Sea-gullseggs bring a price in the markeithat makes it worth while to gatheithem at a considerable expense but noone thinks it worth while to rob thepetrels nests on the rookeries at theFarallon islandsIt is different in Australia Is it thecold winds that blow up from the antarctic regions or the hot air that sweepsdown from the equator No matterwhat the cause the fact is that the appetites of our Australian cousins are radically different The sooty petrel isthere an edible fowl with a decidedmarket value and a number of men andsmall craft are employed each year incatching salting packing and carryingit in great quantities from the rookerieson Trefoil island and other adjoiningislands on the north coast of Tasmaniato Stanley and MelbourneMutton birds is the general namegiven the petrel there and the men andships engaged in the business areknown as mutton birders To Americans this is quite a novel industry andthe fact that such common sea birds asthe petrel are packed and salted downlike so much pork is always a matter ofwonderment to strangers who go thereBut the test of the pudding is in the eating of it and those who have dined oilmutton birds instead of land muttonpronounce the one every bit as good asthe otherIf you leave San Francisco in Augustsailing westward and southward youwill pass many great flocks of birdsthat will be pointed out to you as sootypetrels or they will pass you for theyare traveling about three times fasterthan you are And when you reachMelbourne and have become acclimatedenough to venture a trip across to Tasmania you may dine off the young ofthose very birds that passed you on theCalifornia coast only now they will beserved to you as mutton birdsThese fowls leave theFarallones everyfew months and once every year theyvisit Australia Trefoil island is theirchief roosting place in the southernhemisphere so far as is known Herethey scratch and dig in the barren soiluntil they have burrowTed a hole perhaps two feet deep Into these holeseach hen in the immense flock depositsher one egg The mutton birder insertshis arm full stretch for his game Hedoes not take the eggr but waits a weekor ten days after the egg has beenhatched Then he finds the young birdalmost as big as its parent but muchmore tender and fat On landtthepetrel is quite unable to escape fromthe catchers It cannot mount into theair from off the land though its wingsare enormously long in proportion toits black body and it rises quite gracefully from the water On shore however the strange bird must hop alongat a slow pace and can only fly from thetop of a ledge Certain points of Trefoilisland are littered with thousands ofthese nests and it is no difficult taskto gather the yearly harvest of youngmutton birds The mutton birdingseason on Trefoil lasts from amonth to six weeks and this includesthe catching salting packing and shipping They are packed in casks andthese are loaded on coasting schoonersthat come after them from Tasmaniaand Melbourne San Francisco ChronicleEating Dinner BackwardAn odd experiment with the kinetoscope took place not long ago in Boston The subject was a man eating dinner and the film prepared especiallyfor the occasion wras found of unusuallength so that the whole performancecould be recorded The man enteredthe room and seating himself at a table proceeded to cut up the food Themotion of the fork Croui che plate to hislips was carefully recorded until thelast morsel of food had vanished Thenhe arose and walked out of the roomleaving nothing on the table but baTedishes The series of pictures was thenveversed It showed the man enteringthe room walking backward He satdown at the table upon which therewas nothing but bare dishes and proceeded to extract food from his lips until he had filled the potato dish with potatoes and gradually put together asteak 05 the platter before him Thenhe calmly backed out of the room andthe waiter did likewise with the mealthat the man had apparently createdTroy TimesJudging from

explaining howhis wonderful trick of catching the bullets shot at him by six national guardsnnien was doneOn both occasions the famous prestidigitateair stood alone upon the stagewhile six picked marksmen from thestaite national guard fired point blankupon him from a platform built in theaudience On both occasions Herrmannpale of face and painfully alertv caughtthe bullets previously marked by a committee of noted army men and handedthem back hot from -the barrels foridentificationOf course it was a trick but it wasa dangerous trick and one that Herrmann disliked to do But even he wasless inervous than the marksmen whoacting in perfect good faith feared thatthey might kill the plucky magicianMany have been the alleged explanations of this trick published in variousnewspapers They have all been wrongHerrmann himself told the Herald howit was done and here it iOf course there was an accompliceand this accomplice was not one of themarksanen but the sergeant in chargeof them This sergeant took the sixregulation army bullet cartridges ona silver platter to the committeeThe xmamttee -examined them madesure they were genuine marked themplainly and replaced them on the platter The sergeant instantly raised theplatter in plain sight at arms lengthabove his head walked over to themarksmen and they themselves eachtook a cartridge examined it andplaced it in the rifle Then came theshootingThe trick lay in the platter whichhad a false bottom Under this bottom lay six other cartridges identicalin size weight and appearance butholding bullets made of a compositionof plumbago and mercury TVhen thesergeant held tlhe platter aloft hetouched a spring and by a clever mechanism these six fake cartridgesjumped into the platter while thegenuine cartridge disappeared1 beneaththe false bottomSo it was the composition cactridgesthat the marksmen uoHoiowingly putinto their rifles and on firing this composition was instantly melted by friction through the barrels and dissipatedin the airMeantime however the supposedlyempty platter was taken behind thewings where the genuine cartridgeswere drawn out quickly heated andcarefully placed by an attendant on atable where Herrmann just before thefiring carelessly picked them up andpalmed them Holding them in hishands during the firing he immediatelyproduced them as the smoke clearedA simple trick but a very dangerousone for if the platiters mechanismfailed to work completely one or moreof the genuine cartridges might havegot into the rifles of the marksmenand thence into Herrmanns body NY HeraldDipping Into TheologyA man

ApparentlyExcellent MethodMy -way of stacking fodder is as follows I beg in the stack the same as ashock fthat is by standing- bundles almost perpendicularly on the groundbutt down and tops pressed togetherI continue in this way placing the bundles close together until the shock orprospective stack is about 12 feet indiameter at the base ground Thisusually requires 50 or 60 bundlesNext instead of getting up on thisshock or stack bottom and havingsome one pitch the bundles to me whileI lay them down horizontally as isusually done I remain on the groundand continue there till the last bundles is placed when a ladder is leanedagainst the stack and the top tiedI begin the topping out process bygrasping a bundle with both hands andlifting it say three feet from the groundlaying or more properly speakimriAoSTACK OFGOHNFODDERstanding it on one of the bundles of thelast or outside course of shock or stackbottom L continue in this way -walkingaround the stack and placing bundles side by side until I come aroundto the starting place This completesthe first elevated course The butts ofthis course being about three feet fromthe ground brings them to a pointabout where the bundles underneathare tied See cutThe bundles for the next or -secondelevated course are placed in order bymeans of a two tined pitchfork Thebutts of this course are about six feetfrom the ground and like the butts ofthe first elevated course come to aboutthe middle of the bundles underneathThe butts of the third or last courseconsisting of say eight or ten bundlesare placed about nine feet from theground This makes a stack about 14feet in heightWhen the last course is placed in order the top of the stack is securely tiedin two places one within a foot or twoof the extreme top and the otheraround the butts of the top courseTwo men are not required to put upthis kind of a stack I built ten suchstacks -this year myself without any assistance One man says he puts about600 bundles in a stack I put only about120In stacking in this way there are nobundles lying dowTn with butts sticking outward as in stacks as usuallybuilt They all stand up in an almostperpendicular form butts down topsup The bundles having so muchpitch they shed the water perfectlyIn feeding from such a stack I beginwith the ground course as the bundlesmay be easity pulled out The topbundles remain untouched till the lastthus leaving no part of the stack exposed to the weatherI adopted this plan -three or fouryears ago and like it quite well Itsadvantages are 1 The bundles having so much pitch they shed the watercompletely 2 In feeding therefrom-the bottom bundles are fed first and thetop left to protect the stack till thelost 3 One man can take the bundles from the wagon and construct sucha stack

cling togetherin a very solid manner You cant pullthe bees apart and you may roll theball over and overIf a strange queen is thrown intoa hive she is usually balled and asnearly as we can make out the processis something like this The bees seizethe queen at various points till she isentirely surrounded then other beesseize the ones that have hold of thequeen and in this position they remainfixed for hours until the queen is deadIf a strange worker is thrown into thehive she isnt treated the same as aqueen and nothing but a queen is everballed The worker may be bitten orstung but never balledThe balling bees generally make ahissing sound unlike the noise theymake at any other time Whether thatproceeds from anger or what we do notknowSometimes bees will ball their ownqueen usualty for the sake of protecting her In the middle of a ball of herown bees it certainly seems she oughtto be safe from foes You cannot pullthe bees apart so as to free the queenand if you should succeed in gettingsome of the bees away or should manage to get the queen loose the beeswill immediately seize her again Perhaps the quickest way to get the queenfree is to throw the ball into coldwater The little miscreants willscramble to get out of the water aslively as they can and at once seem toforget all about the queen leaving herto her own fateWater is not always at hand and youcan blow smoke upon the ball If youblow hot smoke upon them as usually3ou will if you hold the nozzle closeenough you will at once seal the queensdoom for the bees will promptly stingher but if you hold the smoke at a distance and keep up a strong stream ofcool smoke the bees will soon concludethey want to find some place with apurer atmosphere Southern CultivatorINEXCUSABLE WASTEWhy Some Poultry Men Do Not MakeTheir Business PayOne cannot fully realize the extentof loss entailed upon those making anysort of pretense to poultry raising untilthe various grades of it are examinedin the great iharkets and a selection ismade of that which is desirable to suita reasonably well cultivated taste Hereis where the critical test is made ofthe sort of care the poultry has received from time of incubation untilproperly dressed and packed ready forshipment to the central market as wellas the profit wrhich is to be realized orthe loss sustained by the systematic orcareless producers Packages standside by side in every commission housein Chicago amounting to thousands oftonf per annum of poultry of all gradesof quality invoking the discriminatingprices which rendered unto the indifferent poultry raiser that which belong to the slothful and unto the systematic the profits which belong to theindustrious -some shippers obtainingfour or five cents per pound while othersobtain ten to 15 cents and actually thehigher priced product is more satisfactory to the consumer than the cheaper stuff Some of the poultry is plumpwhite and nicely dressed wThile muchof it is thin dark colored and repulsiveto look upon The surprising thing isthat the shippers of this joor stuff areoffended because they fail to receivethe highest quotations in return fortheir shipments There is room for atremendous amount of improvement inthe raising and handling of poultryThe farmers need a good deal of education upon this subject to enable themto do their best Farmers UnionPOULTRY HOUSE RAKEHomemade Contrivance ThatAnswersWell for Its PurposeThe winter poultry quarters shouldhave four or five inches of loam or roaddust on the floor for the fowls to scratchin and dust themselves in but thissoon becomes covered with feathersPOULTRY HOUSE RAKEand masses of droppings A finetoothed rake is serviceable in rakingover the pens thus collecting all feathers etc when they can be put intobarrels with the

strip of hard wood should beused for the head while an old hayrake handle can be pressed into servicefor the handle Orange Judd FormerEurope Egg ConsumptionA Parisian scientist asserts that hehas

importedJ 250000000 eg s for which was paidabout 20000000 The eggs came principally from France During the sameyear Germany imported 20000000pounds of eggs- also representing about20000000 Most of these eggs camefrom Russia and Austria Hungary Ofall European countries Russia has madethe greatest advance in exportationIr 1890 she exported only 11000000 butin 1S95 the number rose to 1250000000representing a value of 10200000 Asignificant fact in connection withthese statistics- is that in thoseJ tries which are the greatest exportersof eggsv the omelet is the favorite

and are made with less fullnessand weight than heretofore The skirtsare made up with five six or sevengores depending upon the width of thematerial which governs economy incutting The seven gored skirt is rather the favorite and is used when thematerial warrants it The back isplaited or gathered and the space atthe top containing the fullness is verynarrqw Some of the skirts that areplaited in the back are laid in tiny sideplaits while others have three boxplaits graduated to a narrow space atthe top the outer plaits overlappingthe inner ones Street skirts are madefrom 4 to 4 yards in width andall fit closely across the front andhips with an easy hang across thefront and sides at the bottom All thefullness is worked toward the backbreadths which are cut with a biasseam directly in the back to give thestanding out effect so much desiredMany dressmakers aire wiring the topsof their skirts in the lining acrorheback to give a slight bustle effectA small pad directly under the dressband in the back which fills in a hollow found in most figures is an addition to all gowns and the weight is really less feltThe drop skirt is much used and iseconomical Avhere one wishes to use thesame lining for several skirts The lining which is usually of silk is cut andfit precisely like the outside and canbe hung from separate bands or attached to the same belt If worn withone skirt alone hang them from thesame band and catch all the seamsonce lightly together up a distance of20 inches from the bottomSleeves were never more varied instyle or more becoming to the figurethan the sleeve of to

doing no good it is not-likelyto do harm In a recent number ofthe Gazette Medicale attention wasdrawnto the remarkable result attending the administration of music to alittle girl of three who was afflictedwith serious nervous disordersy resulting in epilepsy and paroxysms of fearwhich kept her awake all night Theordinary remedies including bromideof potassium were tried without anyeffect and at last the physician recommended the mother to ft jay some softrather melancholy music to her daughter before putting her to bed Ghopinwas recommended especially thewaltzes in the minor key The remedyworked like a charm for it is said thatfrom the night the child went to bedunder the influence of music she lostall her nervous symptoms and sleptwithout waking until the morning Inorder to prove that this was not the result of mere chance the music wasomitted on one evening and the childpassed a night of misery not so intenseas before the adoption of the treatmentbut still very
