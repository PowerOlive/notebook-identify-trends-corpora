Marguerita Sylva
in "THE HONEY BEE"
The picture tells ihe tale of a woman worker, and likens her
to the undeveloped female bee of the hive, who lives but to work,
endlessly and uncomplainingly. But when once the little bee
X2stes of honey, it becomes demoralized. So it is with the wo
man in business. She labors for years, but when once .her fem
inine instincts are aroused, she is no longer satisfied with her lot.
