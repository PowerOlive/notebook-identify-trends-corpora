surroundingledge for I could see the sun throughthe water overhead It was longestfrom east to west and in the middlewas small projection as high as myshoulders It was this which sent ashivering conviction through me that1 harj fouud the wreck at last and Ieagerly searched for another projection n t the westerly end After taking ioont 20 steps I found it or rather I fount4 a sinail lump of rock whereit should have been and this settledmy last doubt My first impressionthai the foremast had broken off shorter than the main was accounted for bythe fact that the whoie westerly endof the mouuc was two or three feethigher thai the middle Walking eastto the other end 1 found it severalfeet lower yet so our theory as to thedrift of the coral fragments had beenabsolutely correct It now remainedbut to ascertain how thick the coatingwas on the northerly side and 1 rapidly scrambled down to where I hadfirst stumbled against the wreck1 had brought the smaller steel barwith me from the proa and this I began driving against the perpendicularincrustation of coral at a spot near thestern At the second blow however Islightly lost my equilibrium and foundthat the rock upon which I stoodshelved rapidly A horror of the unfathomable depth which lay but a fewfeet beyond made me throw myselfflat upon the bottom digging my nailsinto the coral lest I should slip andsink to I knew not where Lying thereuntil the beating of my heart sloweddown to something like a normal pulsation I saw a faint reflection of lightbeneath the keel enough to show thatseveral feet of the stern hung sheerover the precipiceIt must hae been at least ten minutes before I recovered strengthenough to crawl back upon the higherportion of the ledge then realizingthat my supply of air was nearly exhausted 1 braced myself firmly andbegan driving away with the steel baragain The coral easily crumbled under the blows though at that depth itwas fiiied with live animalculae and ina few moments the bar had penetratedseveral inches then it struck something soft and spongy in which itstuck Rapidly enlarging the hole until I could put my hand into it without tearing the skin I felt about fora second or two and succeeded in detaching a splinter of water loggedwood a piece of the hull itselfThis was enough lor one day I hadfound the reef I had actually foundthe wreck of a ship which from itsCOral deposit must have lain in theone position for over a hundred yearsat least presumably the galleonNeustra Senora de Sevilla And I hadfound that the coral jacket on thenort herly side of her hull v as less thansix inches in thickness I wanted todance from sheer satisfaction hut itoccurred to me that it might be sairto do so in the proa above water so 1started back toward herNow my mind was so filled -wit exultation at having accomplished seeming impossibilities that I tried to putmy hands in my pockets and whistlens 1 strode along But there were nopockets in the confounded rig andthe whistle was a mistake a big mistake It not only exhausted my breathinn air but it produced a concussionin that copper helmet which nearlylifted the roof off of my skull Itshook my confidence so much thatwhen theringing partially subsided inmv cars I hurried along even fastertoward the proa After walking considerably farther than what shouldhave been the proper distance I beganin notto curse my thoughtlessnesstowing the thing along after me instead of leaving it to be hunted upwhen even seconds were precious Inmy nervousness I must have gone toofar Finally I turned back lookingright and left for the line which hadbeen fastened to the lump of coquinaJust when hope had almost left me Istumbled upon the piece of rock andgrasped the rope to ascend But thingsseemed to be turned around Insteadof slanting to the westward as itshould have done the line hung overtoward the precipiceThiuking that I had surely lost mybearings I took a step or two under itin an attempt to haul the proa directly overhead but the rock shelved abruptly In another second I lost myfootin I pulled frantically at the endwbiclTwas fart to the rock but onlystarted it rolling after me Thn Iclutched at the bare coral but it wastoo late Over I went and the rockafter me with a jerk which nearlypulled the line from my grasp Feeling sure that the line would hold at50 feet I clung to it desperately Forjust the fraction of a second it didhold Then I could feel those loopsslowly but remorselessly pulling looseand I shot downwardThen down until the pressuregripped my arms and legs in an ironvise until the blood gushed from mynose and ears The water grew icycold and darker darker The helmetseemed filled with rushing noises withwhisperings and mocking laughter Itried to tear away the lead weightswhich hung from my belt and shoulders but they wouldnt budge For amoment or two I must have becomedelirious I was kissing Doroteassweet lips McPherson was talkingabout Gladstone in his broadestScotch Sam Hung Foo was makingbobbery about a pink devil with redstomach and gilded ears every faceI ver knew flashed before my eyes asif the lens were a kinetoscope 1 henthere came a jerk at the line It musthave caught on something I knew Ihadut fastened the other end Tostay at that depth another secondwould have meant unconsciousnessard death Fearing with every tugthat my weight added to that of rhrock would pull the line loose 1 hauledmyself up hand over hand though theexertion was so great on account ofthe pressure that every motion seemedlikely to burst a blood vessel Ofcourse in doing this the air in theknapsack counted for a good deal inall probability I couldnt have sunkmuch lower unless it had explodedbut the weights would have held me atthat depth had it not been for thatslender bit of rope For several fathoms it needed but the slightest tug tosend me shooting upward and as tfhepressure increased I was better ableto use my arms My strength was going fast however and nothing but theanimal instinct to fight for life savedme Approaching the surface I became weaker or it required morestrength to haul the extra weightand when I finally got 1113- arms acrossthe gunwale and outrigger it was impossible to move another inch Thesupply of air had given out and mylast conscious mot ion was to unscrewthe helmet lensIn a few moments the fresh air revived me and I succeeded in crawlinginto the proa Then I got out of thediving suit took a strong pull at thebrandy flask and hauled in my lineIt had run out so rapidly after fetching loose from the mast that a snarlhad caught the other steel bar andjammed it under the outrigger Otherwise well I didnt like to think ofthatIt is curious what an affection oneI PULLEDFRANTICALLY AT THEENDwill sometimes feel for inanimate objects I petted that coquina anchoras if it had been a living creature Youree we had gone down into the valleyof the shadow together and but for adirect interposition of Providencewould have been likely to remainthere I must have been altogether upset by the experience for after haulinjr the rock on board I held it in mylap and almost cried over itThe position of the proa over deepwater was explained by the lightpuffs of wind which for an hour or twohad shifted to the westard as it v illsometimes do shortly before thechange of monsoon But in half anhour it was again blowing steadilyrom the northeast and I started onmy return 10 AganaIt was then two oclock Havingthe breeze well forward 1 calculatedthat it would take me at least sixho irs to get back but the witch of aboat made good headway within fivepoints of the wind and I sighted Tinquio bearing a little north of eastat four oclock Holding on the samecourse for half an hour Agana thenlay to the southeastard and I put theproa about for a straight run inWhen about ten miles off shore however I discovered that I had companyfor bearing down from the northardwas the biggest catamaran I ever sawThe hull must have been at least ahundred feet long and the sail lookedlike a gigantic balloon The instantI noticed it two words flashed throughmy mi nu Padre Sebastiano and 1was convinced that my oleaginousshipmate was coming to pay Ouajan avisitNow any companions native orSpanish who might accompany thepadre were likely to be either in hisconfidence or under his influence andit struck me that the sea chest mightexcite more curiosity than was reallysafe So I did considerable hard thinking over what had been told me aboutthe sparsely settled portions of the island in the effort to decide upon asafe place for the concealment of bothchest and treasure if it should becomenecessary There was but one spotthat I felt sure about Port Tarofofoon the southeast coast This was aland locked bay surrounded by boldrocky bluffs and was uninhabitedIn an air line it was 92 miles south ofAgana but as the islanders neverwalked or rode that distance whenthey could travel in proas there wasbut one chance in a thousand of anyboats being seen beating in especially as the place had the unsavory reputation of being haunted On the landside there had been an old sugar plantation known as Mount Tarofofo farmbut the goberuador had mentioned itas being abandoned and the mountain or bluff shut out all view of theseaThe more I thought of it the moreit seemed exactly the place I wantedIt needed but the falling off a fewpoints to head for the Cocos island instead of Agana and by half past six Ipassed it as clos in shore as it wassafe to go By seven oclock I hadreached sufficiently to the eastard fora straight run intc Tarofofo and going about rounded Point Paicpoucjust at dusk As the depth of the water and the exact bearing of the bluffswere accurately shown upon my chartI had no difficulty in running ashoreat ilie westerly head of Paicpouc covewhich I judged to be completed sheltered from observation on the landside After lowering the sail I noticedthe water at the spot I had selectedand was on the point of running alongto where the chart showed a smallcreek when a slight opening attractedmy attention The precipice was soclose that I could have tossed a pebbleagainst it and the spot so perfectlysheltered that I felt safe in using mylantern Outlines were becoming indistinct in the gatheringdarkness butthe moment I turned on the current itrevealed a fissure about four feetwide which led diagonally into theface of the rock There was a goodthree feet of water right up to theopening and upon throwing the lightinside I could see that it ended in a culde sac with perpendicular wallsIf I had searched the entire archipelago it would have been difficult tofind a place more perfectly suited tomy requirements when I came againin broad daylight the fissure was invisible 100 feet away It was somethingof a task to unload the contents of thebig chest but in a short time 1 hadthem stowed away under a tarpaulin60 feet from the opening and wasready to leave the cove The moon wasnot yet up but the starlight was sufficient to navigate by and I reachedAgana by 11 oclock As the big proaI had seen was of too heavy draughtto run across the hoa in front of thetown 1 was not surprised at her absence The lights about the gobernadors quarters were sufficient indication that visitors had arrived and Imanaged to sneak up the back stepsto my room without ai trading attention It was well that 1 did so for myface was a sight Little rivulets ofclotted blood covered the lobes of myears and my upper lip my eys lookedlike burnt holes in a blanket and altogether 1 presented a most dissipatedappearancePadre Sebastiano was cordialityitself but I could see that lay brotherFelipes ndracle was working in hismind and that he was trying to figureit out upon natural grounds I wasupon the point of asking him how hehappened to find the big proa so conveniently forthcoming when he decided to proceed down the islands butreflected in time that if I had beenfishing to the eastard as I had explained it would have been obviouslyimpossible to see his flagship so Ipumped him dry upon Ladrone datainsteadThe Agana padres regarded his visitas complimentary in the highest degree respectfully swallowing his yarnabout collecting materials for islandhistory but I couldnt help chucklingonshe said that as it was usually roughand windy there few of the islanderscared about it only remaining in thelittle villages during the wet monsoonor while they were gathering rice andsugar crops She was willing to goanywhere I chose to take her howeverand had no suspicion of my objectuntil we headed into PaicpoUc cove forthe instruments and diving apparatusThen before taking them from thefissure I told her of my intention tosearch for something under the sea atSanta Kosa reef and asked if she wouldhelp me Looking straight into myface for a moment she saidDoes not Senor Enrique know of areason why I would do anything in theworld for himNothing more than the evidence ofyour

went to France in1776 he took bis grandson with him togive him a little French language andaddress With still other ends in viewso soon as he was settled in Paris hesent him to finish his education atGeneva as T intend him for a Presbyttrian as well as a republican Herethe boy remained four years and thenreturned to live with his grandfatherwho wrote the mother I have had agreat deal of pleasure in Ben He is agood honest lad and will make I thinka valuable man He gains daily uponray affection and we love him verymuch Young Bache came to America with his grandfather and by his aidwas established as a printer Franklinsupplying all the equipment for the office which he left him in his will together with other property In his behalf also he asked Washington forsome public office an

well in sight Making me the cats paw to secure hischestnuts would comfort Sebastianosvery liverCHAPTER XIThat the combination against mehad strong odds in its favor seemedobvious and I began to speculate uponhow far it was safe to trust SenoritaDorotea Strolling down to the beachwith her before retiring just tothrow Sebastiano off his guard Ilearned with i tense satisfaction thatshe both feared and detested the manShe whispered also that her father hadreason to suspect the padres Julianand Sebastiano of using their influence against him in Manila For a moment or two I had a suspicion that sheand the gobernador might be underthe padres influence and trying towork themselves into my confidencewith the intention of betraying meafterward But the more I thought ofthis the more improbable it seemedIn the first place relations betweenthe educated classes and the priesthood in Spain are rapidly approachingthose which obtain in Italy neutralityserve the public and so there was sufficient prejudice to make exclusion of hisrelatives almost a policy with the newgovernment This discrimination inj time led to ill feeling and eventuallyBenjamin Franklin Bache became thstandard

forgetthat you are to give papa somethingbcught with your own money for hisbirthday The boys promised and themother departed The fact that thebirthday and the football game occurred on the same date

looking up he encountered thegaze of four wistfully hopeful eyesthe surface distrust beneath hose owners had no reason to regretThen it seemed as though the senoritamust know too much to look uponSebastiano in other than Ids priestlycharacter and if the friendship between us was warming as rapidly asI thought it was reasonably safe tostake her womans heart against herheadFinally deciding to risk it I askedher if she cared to spend Monday uponthe water with me and she acceptedthe invitation with such evident pleasure that I shoved all worry about thepadre clear of my mind for the timeWhen Monday morning came webreakfasted in the patio and made anearly start before Sebastiano appeared sailing leisurely around Cocosreef as if we had the day before us andwere disposed to take
