The cry with the farmers now is
"More sunshine," after the (many
hard rains -of the past two weeks. It
is the general opinion that unless
several days of warm sunshine are
had this week the tobacco will be
badly damaged and that the corn
and other crops will also rot.
Tobacco growers are very much
discouraged over the present condi
tions. Tobacco cutting is on with
full speed, and the crops are rapidly
being placed under shelter. It is
estimated by conservative men that
fully one-fourth of the crop in this
county is affected by "rust" and
"wildfire," and will hardly be worth
stripping and housing. Farmers
are paying from ?4 to $6 per day
for extra men to house the crop. One
man, named John Johnson, made
$18 one day last week cutting to
bacco. There will be a fine crop in
the county, despite the present ad
verse conditions.
The abundant rains have been
very beneficial to the grass, there
being an excellent prospect for fall
grazing, together with a very propn
ising hay crop, which insures plenty
of feed for the fall and part of the
winter. The best corn crop grown
in the county in many years is ma
turing, which will largely make up
the deficiency caused by the damag
ed tobacco crops. Fall plowing has
commenced, as the season for seed
ing wheat and rye is at hand. 'A
large acreage of wheat and rye will
be sowed this fall. The potato crop
promises well. The second crop
seed is up nicely, and, with a favor
able season of sunshine, will make
a good yield.
Country produce is coming in
abundantly and the prices are very
reasonable. The :ains have fresh
ened up the gardens. All kinds of
livestock is doing well. Hogs ana
lambs continue steady. About five
hundred heavy cattle were shipped
out during the week, going princi
pally to the Eastern markets.

DISCOVERS NEW STAR IN THE
HEAVENS
The new star in the constellation
cygnus, reported Tuesday through
Harvard Observatory, was caused by
a collision in the heavens between
a large comet and a comparatively
dim sun, according to information
which Captain Thomas J. J. See, of
the Naval Observatory at Mare
Island, announced he had received
frcm Prof. Charles C. Conroy, of Los
Angeles.
The star forms a corner of the
paralellogram of Alpha, Gamma and
Delta sygni, plain, he had been ad
vised.
At present it is of the second mag
nitude and the magnitude may be
expected to increase for several davs,
but will die down in the course of a
few months, he reported.
An Airdale, the finest in Ken
tucky, will be the gubernatorial
watchdog. Governor Morrow re
ceived word of this in answer to his
letter sent the Louisville Airdale
! Club, asking suggestions as to where
jhe could get a good all-round dog,
stating that he preferred an Airdale.
But just any kind of "all-round dog"
did not seem fitting for the Execu
tive Mansion in the opinion of Eu
gene Straus, President of the Airdale
Club and ne thus expressed himself
at the weekly meeting of the club
Mr. Straus, in his letter, notified
Governor Morrow that the finest Air
dale in the State would be awaiting
him at the State Fair grounds, Sep
1 ember 16, Governor's Day at the
fair.
The letter stated that every mem
ber of the club has offered a fine
Airdale and to decide who should
have the honor of supplying the ex
ecutive watchdog, puppies from the
various Aiidale kennels would be
displayed at the fair for Governor
Morrow and Mrs. Morrow to make
their selection.
For the showing of dogs this year
at the fair, the Louisville Airdalrf
Club has temporarily merged its in
terests with other kennel clubs form
ing the State Fair Kennel Club. A
(Clubhouse which was constructed re
cently at the fair grounds will be
open to all dog fanciers and 'lunches
will be served during the fair. Ninety-three
breeds of dogs will be
shown.
The showing of dogs this year at
the fair will be September 16, 17 and
18, and the Irish wolfhound is ex
pected to be one of the most inter
esting dogs on the benches.
