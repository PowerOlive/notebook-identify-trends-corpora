PUBLIC UTILITIES WAKE UP
Public Utilities of Kentucky elec
tric, gas, traction, water and tele
phone companies in a combined ef
fort are to place their "after-war"
case directly in the hands of the per
sons to whom they the responsible
their customers.
With the plight in which the rail
roads have been placed as an incen
tive for immediate action, united ef
fort is to be made to place the facts
regarding public utilities directly be
fore the public and let it be the
judge and jury.
Their composite "case" is to be
made known through the Kentucky
Committee on Public Utility Infor
mation, whose organization has just
been announced. This committee,
with offices in Louisville, is to ope
rate "under the auspices of the Ken
tucky Association of Public Utilities,
and other public service organizt
tions, and in the interest of their
customers, investors and employees."
The public utilities' plans call for
the expenditure of several million
dollars for rehibilitation work, ex
tensions, and improvements. They
are asking only for "sane, scientific,
non-political and just treatment,"
such as will enable them to perform
the services imposed by their inti
mate relationship with the everyday
life of every man, woman and child
in the State and the communities in
which they operate.

Personally we try to stay sane;

Paris "fans" are very well pleas
ed that Cincinnati won the world's
series baseball championship. The
scoreboard on the window at the
Cahal Bros.' shop was the center of
interest each afternoon, when there
was a game on. II any real baseball
"fan" who was in Cincinnati at the
time failed to see at least one of the
games, it must have 'been his own
fault, for, the series going eight
games, gave all a chance to get in
the big park, notwithstanding the
large crowds that attended the first
games played there.
The Reds came through with
great gameness, and our hats are off
to Manager Pat Morgan and his
great team. May they win a dozen
more pennants and championships in
a row. Their victory this year has
been one of the best advertisements
that Cincinnati has had for a long
time.
There has been a very generous
sponse from the public to the ap
peal made by the Relief Committee
for the destitute Armenians and
Syrians. Contributions have come in
very liberally, but there is need for
more. Those who have not yet made
donations, may do so by leaving
second-hand clothing, shoes, etc., for
men, women and children, at C. B.
Mitchell's store, on Main street.
Look through your possessions, hunt
out articles of clothing as you may
feel no further need for, and send
them as your contribution for the
needy and suffering people of Arme
nia and Syria. It will leave you
nothing to regret.
