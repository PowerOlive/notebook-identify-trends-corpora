DEATHS.
BALL.
Following a protracted illness due
to typhoid fever, Miss Charlina
Samuel Ball, aged twenty-three, died
at fire o'clock, yesterday morning at
the home of her parents, Mr. and
Mrs. Charles S. Ball, on the Mays
ville road, near Paris. Everything
that Medical science and loving care
could do to arrest the progress of
the dread disease, was resorted to,
hut the Grim Reaper's sickle was
ready for gathering the harvest of
this lovely young life, and would not
be denied. The news of Miss Ball's
death flew over the city and county
as on wings of the wind. Wherever
it touched it left sorrow, keen and
poignant, and the expressions of
sympathy for the stricken parents
who had been deprived of the living
presence of their only child, were
many and from the heart.
Miss Ball was born near Blue Lick
Springs, in Bourbon County, twenty
three years ago. Most of her young
life was spent in and around Paris,
where her parents moved several
years ago. Bright, happy and cheer
ful, she carried sunshine wherever she
went. She always had a pleasant
word and a smile for her friends.
Her sweet face and charming man
ners made her a social favorite. If
strangers felt the charm of her rare
courtesy and joyous, sunny tempera
ment, how much more the fond par
ents upon whom she lavished all the
sweet earnestness and careful cul
ture of her mind and nature. Strong
and potent was the influence of this
loving heart which gave of its gifts
so generously. The spirit of her
daily life was love for her parents
and for her friends. Gently, almost
unconsciously it coerced to those
coming in contact with it, to strive
for if not to attain the realization of
her high ideal.
Miss Ball is survived by her par
ents, Mr. and Mrs. Charles S. Ball,
of Paris, her grandmother, Mrs.
Clark, of Danville, two aunts, Mrs.
Rebecca Simms, and Mrs. Lipscomb,
and six uncles.
The funeral will be held at the
family home at three o'clock, to-morrow,
(Wednesday) afternoon, with
services conducted by Rev. W. E.
Ellis, pastor of the Paris Christian
Ghurch. The burial will follow on
the family lot in the Paris Ceme
tery. The casket will be borne by
six friends of Miss Ball, who were
her intimate associates: Mrs. Hiram
Roseberry, Mrs. Amos Turney, Jr.,
Miss Virginia Weatherall, Mrs. Wal
ler Dalby, Mrs. Owen T. Gibson and
Miss Albert Moffett.

CHRISTMAS CARD IN MAILS FOR
THREE YEARS
In an innocent cream-colored en
velope, there arrived at the Louis
ville city hall a pretty red card with
the most cordial Christmas greetings
in gold letters. This being a season
of heat instead of holly, Fred W.
Sulzer, assistant city auditor, to
whom the Yuletide wishes were ad
dressed pondered. The envelope j
was postmarked "San Diego, Calif.,
Dec. 17, 1917," and "Louisville,
July 25, 1921." There were no other
notations and nothing to indicate
where thecard spent the last three
and a half years.
