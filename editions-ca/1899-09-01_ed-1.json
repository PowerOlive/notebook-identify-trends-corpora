It was an odor of roses about my
nephew that led to the discovery of the
glove Up to his nineteenth birthday
which arrived a month ago he had gone
through life contemptuous of buttonholes
and I was a little taken aback about that
time when I ran against him at a corner
with a Marechal Niel at his breast He
whipped it hurriedly into his pocket and
being a kindly old gentleman I pretend
ed not to notice
But my faith in him Wttl profoundly
shaken Soon I learned that he was con
veying tastef ll little buttonholes into tbs
house up his coat sleeve and he blushed
when he wad asked about a tumbler in
his bedroom Then his mother found
six button glove size 5 in his pocket
which none of us could identify
For some days he had only one glove
himself which he carried spread out in
his hand to look like two We could not
think that this was its long lost compan
ion
Pending investigations the glove was
replaced in Alberts pocket in the nice
little piece of tissue paper which protect
ed it Then we watched Albert Hith
erto he had a habit of leaving the room
when the conversation took a feminine
turn But now a change came over him
He sat on when his mother talked with
his aunt over the relative merits of styles
of gowns and though he pretended to be
reading his book he was really drinking
in the conversation
On nnp nccjision he came out of his
shell in a remarkable manner The two
ladies were asking each other what was
the other name for the waterfall back
and Albert carried away by his interest
in the discussion murmured Redin
gote
His mother and his aunt looked at him
in amazement which made Albert turn
both white and red Not long afterward
it leaked out that he knew what sailor
collars were and liked pale pink ones
Albert even began to take an interest
in his sisters dresses
Once he was discovered trying to ascer
tain for himself how much Gertrude who
is 14 measured round the waist Not be
ing accustomed to these attentions Ger
trude liked them at first but it was soon
borne in upon her though she was only
14 that her brother was experimenting
on her for private reasons of his own
Albert was also curious to know what
size in boots Gertrude required and smil
ed to himself when told Gertrude who
has known since she was 4 that she has
large feet did not like this
It must I think have been a week aft
er the discovery of the glove in Alberts
pocket that he asked his mother with an
artificial yawn whether 5Vfc was not a
small size in gloves for a lady Then his
mother asked me to go delicately to work
and find out what was Alberts condition
and who she was
I thought I would leave it to Albert to
tell me who she was but I experimented
on him to discover his condition Noth
ing I feel could have been more delicate
than the way I set about it He carried
the glove in an inside jfeket over the
spot where Albert thought his heart was
Taking advantage of a favorable moment
I got at the coat and changed the glove
to another pocket
The next time I had an opportunity for
it it was hack in the old place again
This happened several times Albert who
is a simple youth for all his cunning evi
dently thinking that he had put the glove
into the wrong pocket himself Then I
hazarded a bolder step Again taking
possession of the glove I dropped it in a
corner of the drawing room
That evening Albert came back from
the olfice in a perturbed state of mind I
watched him on his knees in the hall
looking for something and when he saw
me he pretended to be unlacing his shoes
lie wandered from room to room and was
subsequently heard flinging his things
about in his bedroom He said not a
word about hit loss however to any one
Next morning 1 was surprised to see
him bright and cheerful I went into
the drawing room and behold the glove
was gone From the way the unsus
pecting Albert was incessantly putting
his hand Into that inside pocket I saw
that there was once a 5Mi glove in it 1
had feared that Albert would treasure it
somewhere else now but no he evidently
thought that he had dropped it in the
drawing room accidentally perhaps aft
er passionately gazing on it in secret
But the awakening came when 1 con
cealed the little glove in a vase on the
smoking room mantelpiece Albert ran
it to earth in a day and a half without
saying a word on the subject to any
body unless possibly the housemaid
When next I felt for it in his pocket it
was not there From that time Albert
and I were playing at hide and seek
When 1 was not looking for the glove he
was 1 found it inside tne case or nis
cricket bat and dropped it behind the
niano Albert searched it out and soon
afterward I got it under a corner of the
carpet in his bedroom Then I hid it
among some music knowing that Albert
would look there last All this time 1
did not know if he suspected who it was
that waB playing with him I do not
know now for we have never opened our
minds on the subject
Albert did not find the glovo among
the music When two days had passed
I put it in an easier place for Albert was
bearing his disappointment bravely Still
he did not find it Next I flung it on the
floor of his bedroom and Albert did not
seem to see it 1 laid It on his mantel
piece and he let it remain there At last
it struck me to look in Alberts pocket
again There was another glove in it
size 6 eight bs Icons
Then I weit to Alberts mother and
told her hi- us cured New York News
A Slap at Latla
Way is Latin taught in the schools
Because some foolish person taught it
many years ago and other foolish per
sons have been following in his foot
steps Why dont teachers adopt new
plans when they discover that old ones
are not satisfactory You will find prog
ress everywhere except in the schools
There is no more excuse for teaching
Latin than ther is for teaching for
tune telling Teachers have an qxcuse
for teaching Latin which they learned
from other teachers but there is nothing
in it Latin in the schools is a useless
relic that should have been disposed ot
years ago At least half the stuff taught
in the schools u useless ami takes up
time that should be devoted to practical
studies
Americans cling to a lot of other use
less foolish relics and point to them with
pride Atchison Globe
