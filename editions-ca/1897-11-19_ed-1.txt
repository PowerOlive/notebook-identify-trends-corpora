Will BUsed Tlio Bear Will Be Keady to Sailin About Twenty BaysWashington Nov 16 SecretaryGage has requested the secretary of theinterior to instruct the Alaskan officials to gather about 600 head of reindeer from the government herds forthe use of the expedition for the reliefof the ice bound whalers in the ArcticIt is expected that the Bear which isnow at Seattle will be ready to sail inabout ten days and within twenty daysthereafter it is expected that she willreach some point on Nortons soundwhere a large party will be engagedfor the 600 mile overland trip to PointBarrow The herd of reindeer whichwill be killed for food if needed willbe driven overland and it is the confident expectation of Capt Shoemakerchief of the revenue cutter service andCapt Hooper who is in command ofthe Bering sea patrol fleet that theparty will reach Point Barrow andthe imprisoned whalers before themiddle of February The route overwhich the herd will be driven is saidto abound in moss upon which thereindeer feed and both agree that thescheme for the relief of the whalers isperfectly feasible and will be attendedwith little danger Capt Tuttle whowill command the Bear is regarded asone of the most capable and trustworthy men in the service and no apprehension is felt regarding the outcome of the enterpriseSecretary Alger has directed theaward of the contract for the fourlocks on the Ohio river to the lowestbidders the Evans ville Ind firm ofEigemann Hollerbach EichelArnold There are many protestsagainst this award but the secretaryafter looking up the law in the casefound that he had

Durgan of Boston Dr AH Doty of New York and Dr S ROlliphant of New Orleans the latterpresident of the Louisiana state boardof health members of the AmericanPublic Health association called atthe white house Monday Theysaw the president and urged him toincorporate in his message a recommendation that a commission be appointed to go to Havana to study thesubject of yellow fever and the mannerin which it is brought to the UnitedStates They claimed that good regulations in Havana would do more toprevent yellow fever in the UnitedStates than the best quarantine regulations that can be adapted and enforced The president said he wouldgive their suggestions due considerationWashington Nov 1C The attitudeof the administration towards the subject of reciprocity with Canada is probably disclosed in the following statement of a government officialThe task of the government wouldbe made easier if the statesmen inongress would- be controlled by theinterests of the country at large Someof them unfortunately confine theiri views to a particular concession to beobtained from a foreign country for alocal interest and then desireour compensatory concession to bemade not by their own but by someother locality They make of reciprocity a series of questions to be settledin the interest of particular districtsWe may be able to secure arrangements which will add millions to ournational export trade and yet itmight be defeated by a combinationof a few minor local interestsnot amounting to a million Yatreciprocity means mutual concessionwithout this nothing can be accomplished We must give a market if weacquire one not necessarily a freemarket but an accessible marketTake coal for illustration By givingaccess to the New England coast wemight gain access perhaps control inthe coal market of all central Canadawith mutual advantages by reason ofgeographical and transport conditionsWould it be wise for coal producers toantagonize these national conditionsIt i the same with other articles ofcommerce where long water transportation is balanced against short rail-way carriage In samp things we canacquire an almost exclusive marketgreatly increasing cur exports in exchange for a market open only to thecompetition of the other party So itis with some phases of the question oilogs and coarse lumber against manufacturers of wood Whenever we enlarge the market of manufactures weinevitably enlarge demand for our rawmaterial from which they are madeand this tends to increase the pricepaid to the original producer Theadvantages of increased trade arewidely distributedThe major portion of commercial exoh ange in this country is in the exceptional condition of producing a surplus both of raw material and of themanufacture products Our policymust take into view this situation although it increases our difficulty innegotiations which shall satisfy everyinterest All that can be hoped is aresult which in the aggregate shallbe clearly advantageous to the nationas a

with anentreaty stretching forth her handsimploringly with jtones beseechingenough to have turned a much harderheart than that of the chief deputyShe ended with a clear incisive demand for more speedy action Thehearing was finally adjourned untilFridayNot only is there to be a fight in thecourts over the fortune left by the lateJohn B Ketcham but his brotherGeorge who left Tuesday night for Toledo with the remains says he thinksthat a dummy was used at the weddingin Milwaukee in September and thathis brother was not the man marriedat allAn estate consisting of gilt edgedsecurities and real estate worth notless than S250000 represents the fortune left by Mr Ketcham His brother George H Ketcham is disposed tobelieve that when the dead bankers assets are inventoried they will be foundto exceed 300000 and perhaps mayrun as high as 350000 The brief investigation that John B Ketchamsfriends have made since Mondaymorning seems to have satisfied themthat in spite of his excesses and hisextravagance he did not seriously impair his fortuneAll this property is to revert to thewoman who announced herself to beKetchams widow the day after he diedthat is of course if she can

as the writing in the threatening communication shows by the-badly-printedletter through itI understand so far said WelshBut what kept you so long in the rosebushes when you went after the umbrella I thought you would nevercomeHendricks smiled I went to findher revolver I knew it must be somewhere near for I had seen a freshlybroken boxwood twig near the tracksand knew that she would not havewished to be seen with the revolverafter the report I found it carefullyhidden in a thick cluster of long grassabout two yards from her footmarksI Would have brought it with me butshe will go for

want you tddiscover if there is any reason for MrsWalters desiring to leave the city atpresent Find out if you can whatsort of girl she was before she married Was she in love with Waltersand does she know Whidby personallybe sure about that and has she everhad any affair of the heart with himAh I get a little light exclaimedWelsh If she is interested in Whidbyand knows him to be guilty she mayliave played that part to mislead us toestablish an alibi for him which wouldnot be hard to do since he is underwatch in another part of town Ah sheis a clever girlHendricks paid no attention toWelshs remark He had begun hisnervous walk up and down the roomagain Welsh cleared his throat andHendricks caught his eye Oh hesaid I forgot you To be more frankI am watching the movements of a distinguished stranger who is at my hotelunder an assumed name I know himwell that is I did in New York I havean idea that he came by appointmentwith Whidby and Col Warrenton Iflie did I shall be absolutely nonplussed and shall have to begin all overagain What I have discovered at themayors wont amount to a row of pinsCHAPTER XThe next morning after the sensationat Mayor Roundtrees Warrenton caliedon WhidbyWell he began cordially as hisfriend motioned him to a seat in thelibrary and stepped back to close thedoor youve read about the shootingat the mayors That ought to makeyou feel better it is additional proofthat you are not the manWhidby sat down by his friend andcrossed his hands over his kneeOn the contrary I am more miserable to day than everWhy what is the matterAnnettehas just left meShe has been here again How veryimprudent She ought not to havecomePoor little girl sighed WhidbyShe had heard about the shooting atthe mayors and was so happy over itthat she came right in regardless ofconsequencesWell surely there is nothing in sucha beautiful proof of her love as thatto make you despondent You oughtto have been glad to see her happy youungrateful dogUnfortunately she went away morexiiserable than she has been since themurder I know I acted the fool Ibroke my promise to you about keepingthe theory of my having been hypnotized to myself I could not help itold man dont scold Itisdone Sheexpected me to be elated over the newdevelopments and with that bloodyhorror over me I simply could not beno She wormed it all out of me finally and now she is quite undone Sheturned sick and almost fainted in thelibrary and could hardly walk whenshe left the house She went home crying at every stepYou might have known tlti such athing would horrify herWhidby groanedPoor little darling She begged andbegged me to tell her what depressedme so She knows very little abouthypnotism and when I tried to explainthat I feared I had beenmade to killmy uncle with my own hands sheshrieked and looked at me as if shethought I was madI am awfully sorry you told herat least until we have had the opinionof that hypnotic doctor He may proveto us that you were not hypnotized atallWhidby rose and began to pace thefloor nervouslyI shall welcome any advice or opinion he can give I have just begun tothink I did wrong in not reportingeverything to Hendricks at the startIt may have been a very necessary clewI mean you know the blood on thechairI begin to think so myself now thatthe murderer has actually shown himself in broad daylight and attemptedanother life You can easily prove analibi You were here all day yesterday Matthews and I can testify tothat and besides I am pretty sureyour movements are being watched bythe police I want you to see Hendricks but not before we have an interview with Dr Lampkin He is at theHotel Imperial He came yesterdayand at my request has registered underan assumed name I made an appointment with him to meet me here andexpect him every minuteWhat so soon and Whidby shuddered Ugh old man I hate the subject I am actually afraid of what hemay tell meNever mind nothing can be worsethan the suspense you are sufferingYou will lose your reason if somethingis not doneThe doorbell rang That must beour man said Warrenton Keep yourseat I told Matthews to let me answerthe bell and I will bring him inThe next moment the colonel usheredin the visitor He was short thick setand about 45 years of age Hishair was stiff very abundant and darkbrown with dashes of iron gray Hisface was of the round German typehis eyes were steely gray and shot withstrange spots of brown which withhis long lashes gave a peculiar effect tohis glance He wore a heavy beardwhich he stroked continually in a nervous way and a cutaway suit of ordinarygray material His manner was veryeasy and inspired confidence On being introduced to Whidby he held hishand tightly for a moment and lookedsteadily into his eyes then he releasedthe hand and sat downI presume you have looked over thenewspaper accounts I sent you doctor said Warrenton I thought theywould prepare you for the slight additional information we are going to giveyouI had seen them all before I camereplied the hypnotist I had no sooner read that the dead man pardon meyour uncle Mr Whidby had beenfound murdered with that smile on hisface than I wanted to know all about itNo other case has ever occurred that Iknow of except that of Goetz of Berlinin SS But tell me gentlemen in whatway I can serve you My time is valuable I want to say just here that Iam afraid Hendricks the detective hasrecognized me I knew him in NewYork but had no idea that he had beenretained here I tell you this so thatjou may dismiss me if my presencecould injure your case in any way Itried to follow your instructions as tomy disguise here but was thrown entirely off my guard by meeting himface to faceIt does not matter now returnedthe colonel There are only one ortwo points that he does not know aboutour side and wc have decided to placeourselves wholly in his hands after ourinterview with youI am sure that is wise said DrLampkin Hendricks is the most farseeing man I ever knew It would beunjust for any reason to withhold theslightest light you may be able tothrow on the matter Mr Whidby youneed not tell me what your particulartrouble is for I think I have alreadyeruessed it from one look at vour senTHE BOURBON NEWS FEIDA NOVEMBER 19 1897sitive face You fear that lrypnotismwas used by the criminal in some wayYou have guessed it falteredWhidbyYou think Mr Strong was hypnotized just before his deathYesThat you may have been hypnotizedand made the murderers tool for performing the actYesYou were led to this conclusion bythe blood stain on your hand on the portiere and the drop on your cuffI have other reasons which have notbeen made public 1May I ask what they are I thoughtyou testified to your experience in fullat the inquestSome things seemed to come backto me later in the day I cant say evennow that I was not dreaming but I havean indistinct remembrance of being upthat night of walking from the portiere towards my bed and of striking achair and ca telling it with my hand tokeep from falling It seemed to me thatI caused my shirt to fall from the chairto the floor and that I picked it up andreplaced it before going back to bed Itold Col Warrenton about it the nextday He went into my room and disrcovered a blood stain just where myhand had been on the chair I think itescaped the notice of the detectiveIf it did it isthe first blood stain thatever escaped himHe did not mention itne never mentions anything Hehas been discharged from more thanone case for looking like an idiot butthats part of his method He knowswhat he is doingThere was a short silence thenWhidby and Warrenton could see thatthe hypnotist was deeply engaged inthought Presently he said brusquelyIll have to see you again to morrowor next day Mr Whidby I can donothing now Will you come with meto my hotel colonel I want to consultyou on a point of law before we go anyfurther I think it will be necessaryMi Whidby for you to get a goodnights rest before we do anythingWhere do you sleepLast night I began occupying myold room just across the hall repliedWhidby I was sleeping there whenthe crime was committed and I havehad an aversion to it ever since but Iwas glad to find that I slept better therelast night than I had upstairs in another roomYou naturally would and you werewise to move back If you go to bedwith the idea that you are doing even aslight thing for self protection thethought will haunt you in your sleepIt is one of the psychic laws Wouldyou mind showing me the roomNot at all The three men rose andwent into Whidby s roomWhich is the chair you spoke of andwhere was it placed that night askedDr LampkinWhidby drew it from behind a screenin a cornerYou ought not to have placed itthere remarked the hypnotist Theidea of its being pushed away out ofsight will remain with your sub-consciousnesslonger than you dream ofSuch things belong to a wonderfulscience that all ieople ought to knowWhere was the chair standing thatnight as near as you can rememberExactly there And Whidby placedthe chair within a few feet of the bedAh yes said the hypnotist Isee where you touched it that nightwith your hand Now do as I directyou Leave it exactly where it is andto night when you go to bed place yourfifllr1 1 71I mean you know the blood oa the chairshirt on it precisely as you did beforeAll these things will aid you to sleepsoundly and believe me that is whatyou need above all things just nowRemember when you lie down to nightthat I have told you positively on myhonor that you will sleep better thanyou ever have slept beforeYon mean Col Wairenton interposed that it will be necessary for himto sleep well before before the thetestA slight almost unnoticeable look ofvexation passed over the fate of thehypnotist but it was gone when hebegan to speakOh no only that it will put him in abetter humor He is rather too despondent for his own good I dont want totalk to him about any test now Thatwill be for the future Perhaps wewont have it at allCHAPTER XIAfter Dr Lampkin and Col Warrenton had taken their leave and were onthe way down town Dr Lampkin saidI must make a confession to youWhat I said about wanting to talk overa legal point was only a pretext to oeeon alone about another matter Yourfiiend must be hypnotized to nightafter he falls asleep naturally Yousee I had to get the idea of the test outof his mind for that would have madehim unusually wakeful If he washypnotized on the night of the murderit was done when he was asleep and ofcGurse for our test the conditionsnust be the same I have prepared hismind so that he will sleep soundlyto night and if everything works welI think that I can prove conclusivelywhat his actions were on the night ofthe murderI see replied the colonel I placemyself in your hands Use me as vouwillYou must take him for a short drivethis evening atabout seven continued the doctor While you are outI shall come in and secrete mvself somewhere upstairs Then you must makesome

sections of our own and otherstates at this season of the year is picking ginseng This novel calling is justnow being followed by hundreds ofmountain residents who are reaping noinconsiderable harvest from their labors Many almost support their families by digging the plant and so presevering have been the ginseng diggersof late years that the plant has becomequite rare in many sections where itformerty flourished IThis valuable medical plant is to befound all through the Alleghanytains It has a fleshy root and a stalkfrom four to nine inches high whichbears near the top three petiolate leavesof five small leaflets and on the end ofthe stalk some insignificant white blossoms The root is much used in medicine in this country but it is chiefly ofvalue as an article of export to Chinain which country it is supposed to possess remarkable virtues for the treatment of nearly all diseases Its valueat the little mountain store is usualljtwo or three dollars per pound whendried and the green roots there sell forabout one dollar a pound Therootthusreadliy passes as currency in the mountains and is the chief article given inpayment for many purchases made bythe mountain residentsGinseng digging is indeed a novel occupation The sang diggers as theyare commonly called go into the woodsarmed with a small mattock and a sackand the search for the valuable plantbegins Ginseng usually grows inpatches and these spots are well knownto the mountain residents Often hundreds of jounds of the root are takenfrom one patch and the occupation isa very profitable one The women aswell as the men hunt ginseng and thestalk is well known to all the mountainlads and lassies Ginseng grows in arich black soil and is more commonlyfound on the hillsidesFew are the mountain residents whodo not devote some of their time tohunting this valuable plant and in themountain farmhouses there are nowmany hundred pounds of the articlelaid away waiting the market Whilethe fall is the favorite time for ginsenghunting it is carried on all summerWhen a patch of the root is found thehunter loses no time in digging it Toleave it- until fall would be to lose itfor undoubtedly some other hunterwould find the patch and dig itThere is always a ready market forthe article and while many sangdealers visit the mountains the mountain farmers usually sell to the mountain storekeepers They are suspiciousof the cityi dealers who come theirway and they usually find the mountain storekeeper ready to give as gooda price as they can obtain elsewhereThey trade ginseng for their store supplies boots and clothing material Inour state alone thousands of dollarsworth of the root are dug annually andin other mountain states of the eastgreat quantities are also marketedMinnesota is also a well known regionof the plantThis plant is so esteemed in Chinathat the right to gather it is reservedto the emperor It is supposed to possess remarkable virtues for the treatment of body and mind and for the prolongation of life Their physicians havewritten volumes about it and they deemit necessary in all their best prescriptions The best roots have a horny appearance and are yellow and semitransparent This condition is obtainedby putting them into steaming hotwater brushing until clean and thensteaming over boiling millet The rootsthat are bifurcated or divided are considered the most powerful and it issaid that it is to this kind of root thatthe plant owes its name Jin Chenmeans like a man and the AmericanIndian name means the same Thenearer the root resembles the humanform the more efficacious it is supposedto be The genuine roots say theChinese have offshoots to represent thearms and the legs The Orientals havemany legends concerning the greatmedical plant and to it they assignmany powersBefore the discovery of the root in thiscountry it frequent brought itsweight in gold in Peking In 171S theJesuits began shipping the root toChina and in 17S5 it sold in this country for one dollar per pound Over1000 have been paid for a single rootin China Besides China and the UnitedStates Japan and Corea produce thevaluable plant In this country attempts have been made to cultivate theJ root but the attempt has not bfcn sosuccessful as was expectedThe quality of the ginseng root variesgreatly and it requires a shrewd dealerto make a success in the ginseng business Xot infrequently the hunters resort to strategy to get a good roundprice for their supplv With it otherand less valuable roots are mixed andI sometimes the dried roots are immersedin water and then dried on the outsidej The quality of the roots also variesgreatly according to the time of digging and their size The larger rootsare considered the best and commandthe highest pricesIn the mountain

Western SawmillUp from the yellowish brown depthsof the slow moving river flowing sosteadily on its way to the sea comes ahuge dark brown thing with a shiningdripping coat It is our log enteringupon its last stage It passes at onceup a long incline called the slit atrench of wood about eight inches deepand two feet wide at the top so hollowed out that the largest log will liein it securely as it is being drawn upthe incline by the stout chains withwhich the slit is equipped Projectingpieces of steel on this chain serve tokeep the log steady its great weightcausing it to sink upon these pieces ofBteel which are like sharp teeth -Aworkman standing at the side of the-plit by means of a lever throws up twopowerful steel pointed arms which liftthe logs out of the slit and throw themupon tables from which they are rolleddown to the carriage which leads to theBaws When the log reaches the carriage it is thrown upon the frameworkby the nigger a long ratcheted timber or piece of steel This framework islike a section of an ordinary flat carrunning on a regular railroad trackTwo men stand on the moving carriageand at a signal from the head sawyerwho directs the cutting of the log regulate the thickness of the plank orboard by the levers of the carriageWhen the log has been adjusted itrapidly advances to the saw and in avery few seconds its water soaked sideshave been trimmed by the sharp teethThe carriage flies back to the startingplace with the swiftness of the windand it is enough to make one shudder tosee it go You expect every instant thatone of the men will be thrown off andterribly injured They learn to balance themselves however though thereare frequent accidents One instant ofinattention on the part of the head sawyer who regulates the speed of the carriage bj his lever would send the carriage flying back to the end of the millwith tremendous force and probablykill both of the men One of the menon the carriage called the setter fixeithe width of the board to be sawed onsignal from the head sawyer the otherman is the second sawyerAs I stood one day in one of thesemills watching the men fljing forthand back on the narrow carriage andaimost expecting that one or both ofthem would be thrown off in the swiftness of their flight I took out my watchand timed them and I found that theytraveled on an average on this littlerailroad not more than 20 feet

BostonGlobef AT THE END OF I06 THE LARIATBY JUAN MORO2STMmmmwwmmmmmmwmmsorts and conditions of men andALLwomen came together in the cattledays It was one of tbe peculiar features of the time that there never wasasked the question Who are youThe newcomer introduced himself asdid the miners of the mountains in hisown way and -was taken for what hewas worth His real value was usuallydetermined at short notice by the menof the frontier and when they had oncebranded a stranger he might as well acquiesce for the word went along theline as to his standing When he didnot do so he found that there was likelyto be a hint that he could not afford toneglect and he obeyedWhen James Sorten came to the Cimmarron ranch and introduced himselfas the younger son of a wealthy NewEngland er disinherited because of hisfondness for the sports of the plains hewas believed lie looked it His admirable form and his charming manners as manners went in those dayswon to him the mn and women ofthe settlements and made him thefriend of the ranch boys wherever hemet them Some of the boys will yetremember liim and the lively part lieplayed in the drama of the latter GOsRivalries that are now turned towardthe managment of the corporations andthe manipulating of the prices of stockwere then in that section devoted to thehandling of herds and the ranch thathad the largest and most energeticforce of cowboys was the one that hadthe better fortune in that line Sortenwho soon gained the title of Yellowback because of his customary clothesof bright saffron was the leader of therustlers He could scent a maverickfarther than anyone along the trailand woe to the herder that allowed abunch to remain out on the prairie overnight it was likely to be missing forgoodOf course there were efforts to put astop to the practice of running in thewanderers for at least a reasonabletime after the finding of the same Butwho could prevent it Sorten went tothe trail every night to see if there wereany wanderers that needed protectionfrom the blizzards and often returnedwith two or three that had strayed fromsome passing herd One night he didrci return as soon as usual and whenh came in it was with a white face andagitation written upon his entire bodyWhats the matter Jim asked thechief herderSeen a ghost asked anotherNo but Ill tell you boys were hiswcvds Ive seen the fastest rider thatever ivas in this valleyTeli us about itThere aint nothin to tell I wasover in the upper ravine looking fer anyo waiiderin steers that might be needin care aud hud found two when alongcome a stranger on horseback and ordered me to git I dont take any manssass and I told him so What did thatcritter do but give a whoop an scarethem steers so that they went bellowin down the ravine I follered ofcourse an when I saw that there wasntno chance to git them home turnedaround to look at the other one Hesat on his hoss as quiet as you pleasean when I looked at him smiled thenwith auother whoop started after thesteers himself an what do you thinkin a minute lie had em in his line anwas drivin em home which I takeit is over the other side of the trailIt appeared afterward that he hadtiled to overtake the stranger butfailed hence his perturbation Theboys all laughed at him a good dealand he fairly haunted the trail to catchanother glimpse of the mysterious visitor But it was a week before he wassatisfiedA day oft was given the cowboys byreason of the failure of a herd to get5n from the farther range aud we allwent up to the town for a time Jimwas looking for something all thetime and when as we came within amile of the settlement he caught sightof a sorrel horse ahead of us he gavea little cry of joy and sank the spursinto the flauks of his pony viciouslyiWefollowed aud were by his side whenthe sorrel was overtaken Thenvve noticed-somethingthat w hadribt beenawwe of before that the rider of thesorrel was a womanJims face was a study He was sosure his game and when it came asit did he wilted But he braced up alittle and began a conversation Itwas the daughter of the chief herderacross the riverr and she was about aspretty a picture as often came to theeyes of the herders in the territoryShe laughed and joked with Jim andhe deserted us to be by her side WTerede and left them togetherThat was the beginning and forabout a month Jim and his girl werethe talk of the country around Theywere stuck on each other if any twoever were and rode up and down theranges like wandering twin spiritsOnce Jim was scared on the rangeagain and this time he swore that thevisitor made him give up ten head ofthe finest calves that he had ever laideyes on But none of us saw thestranger and the opinion of the ranchwas that Jim was a little leary thatnightt One day the order came to go to thesouthwest after a herd and drive northIt meant two months of hard ridingand how Jim did hate itHe rode over to see his girl for goodby and they had an affecting partingI guess She loved him and wanted tomarry him before he went but Jimwouldnt have it so though he promised that it should be done as soon ashe returnedThat was the year of the cattle suffering on the plains because of the rainand sleet The herds were unable toget from the ice the wet grass beneathand starved and froze to death on thenorthern plains In the territory therewas no suffering of -this sort but thecold rain made it hard for the cowboysand they had the toughest time theyhad ever seen to keep warm while onthe range They rode up and down thelines wrapped in big blankets and withall the scarfs they could gather aroundtheir necksOne night as the storm was worstthere came along the trail a little herdnot more than 200 half starved cattlethat had evidently been herdedthrough the summer on their way northand had not been pushed fast enoughIn the camp wagon that was with themwas a woman She came to the ranchhouse to get some food and we kepther there all night the cooks wifesharing a bed with her The girlfor she was not more than a childasked if we knew a James Morris Ofcourse we did not but when the nextmorning she took from her neck alecket and opening it showed us theface of Yellowback we all lookedblank enough I tell youShe went back to the wagon butthey did not get any farther The mangot sick somehow and the woman wentto the other ranch where she metJeanne Arsey the girl that had thelove of Jim or thought she hadWell the expected happened SheDRAGGING AT THE ENDROPETHE BOURBON NEWS FRl3pT NOVEMBER 19 1897OF THEtold her troubles to Jeanne and thegirl knew that she had been makingleve to a married man Mad Thereis no word to express it She fairlyraged and rode the plains for days almost beside herself She vowed thatshe would kill him and then was willing to forgive for the wifes sake ButJim did not come thenThe wife staj ed and grew sick fasterthan her father At last she died andJeanne was free But those who knewwere glad they had not the task thatwas before Jim when he came homeOur boss told us one day that theherd would be in in a week The ranchwas prepared for the coming and thecowboys looked forward to the eventwith interest for they would get ada off in which they could go over tothe settlementAt last the herd was within a daysdrive and the whole settlement waswaiting for it The boys all knew thesituation between Jim and Jeanne andwanted to see what would happenJim was tired when he came intocamp and did not want to talk Heate his dinner in quiet and then saidLets go over to the townOf course we were ready and a halfdozen of us went with him On theway he asked if we had seen JeanneWe told him nothing about the visitorof the past few weeks and only whenwe got to the town did we see him lookcheerfulJim drank harder than I had everseen him do that afternoon and aboutfour oclock was in a lively mood readyfor any sort of an escapadeAs we rode down the little streetwe saw coming in from the ranchesa woman on horseback All the herders fell back The did not want to seewhat happened at too short rangeJim recognized his old flame andhurried his horse forward to meet herBut she did not hurry Instead shewas in the most exasperating state ofdeliberationHow are ye called Jim so that wecould all hearThere was no answerWhats the matter he demandedDontyou want to many meFor an answer she gave her horse ablow with the riding whip and cameup to his side In her hand Was theI rawhide She liftecHt Kigb and lieforehe could see -what she was going to doit came down across his face again andagain He fairly howled with painbut she rode back to her side of thestreet and kept up the highwayTil kill her shouted Jim and awaywent his horse to the saloon where hehad left his revolverAs he stood before the bar trying toget the barkeeper to give it up sherode in front of the houseJim Morris she called come outhereHow white Jim turned But he wentYou cowardly sneak she beganI thought I loved you once but nowI know you Do you remember thosenights that I used to scare you awayfrom the mavericksJim looked at her in astonishmentHad he been outwitted by a womanAnd last month Iheld in my armsa woman who had this picture Do you1 UOlhuuw itShe held out the miniature that wasin the possession of the woman withthe herd Jim shudderedWhere where did you get it heaskedFrom your dead wifes hands Shebelieved in you and I did not tell herbetter She died blessing you and doyou know where you ought to beThe womans eyes fairly blazed asshe sat there on her horse and facedthe little company of herders and saloonistsJim never said a word He quailedbefore the angry woman but he wastoo angry himself to give upYou said a little while ago that vouwould kill me she began once moreGet on that horse and lets see aboutitA pony was standing near JimsOn its back the men placed him wondering what would be the next movebut all hoping that the vengeancewould fit the crimeIll count three said Jeanne thenlook outOneJim was unarmed what else couldhe do He jabbed the spurs into thepon3r and was off like a shot Up thelong street he went and had 300 feetthe start when came threeThen we knew why the sorrel hadrounded up the mavericks It ran likethe wind At the sound of the mistressvoice it was off and the distance between the two lessened Out on theprairie they sped Then came the endWhen within a short distance of thefleeing man the woman drew a coiledlariat from her saddle and whirled itaround her headOnce twice it circled and then awayin beautiful curves until it settled overthe head of the coward and deceiverJimHer sorrel planted its feet in the sodthere was a jerk and fall and thenaway over the plain toward the ravine where was the little cemeteryshe went a dark object dragging atthe end of the rope They disappearedbehind the hills and she did not comebackIndeed she never came to the settlement again for she moved from thetrail country a few weeks after Butthe boys wished she would come forthey wanted to give her a vote

person his eyesrested on was the late Isaac N Cary sowell known in Washington but whowas then residing at Windsor As MrTucker expressed it he concluded hewas gone The 23000 reward andwhat Cary might deem his dut washe thought too much to leave any hopefor his escape He walked to the bow ofthe boat to try to consider what heshould do He was somewhat disguisedas an Englishman with their

thanks is never lost never wastedIf it sometimes seems to be lost uponthe person to whom it is directed itsexpression has not been lost upon someone else who has heard it It is certainly not lost upon ourselves Themost of us are quick enough to thanksome one who does us great serviceBut the small courtesy just as greatas the large service in reality we overlook It doesnt seem worth while togive

lastThursday of each November set apartas a day of thanksgiving but it wouldbe far better if a great many of us carried the spirit of the day into all theother days Perhaps if we did so wemight have

the handy womaniround the house Some very pretty tand effective results have been thus obtained In making a design to be carried out in brass headed nails it isobvious that simple patterns are aloneappropriate and those having curvedlines are the most to be commendedHighly conventional or purely ornamental patterns too should be chosenfor it would be absurd to draw a naturalesque form in braes nails Youhad better draw out your patterns onthin paper and then transfer them tothe wood by rubbing over the backwith white chalk following the design with a hard point A patternwhich is continuous like the scroll onthe poppy design suggested for ascreen has therefore to be repeatedmany times You could draw just aportion of thick tracing paper and thenprick the design with a thick needleand so makes a pounce of it By rubbing over the design with some powderd chalk tied up in muslin you willget an impression on the wood as thechalk will pass through the prickedholesYour design would consist of lineswhich you will fasten with nails putting each nailpoint on the line anddriving the nail straight home with awell directed tap Your difficulty atfirst will be to get the nails to fasten onevenly and to judge the distance eachpoint should be from the last nailthough this could be overcome by measuringThus if a nail is half an inch in widthwith a pair of dividers or a rule yonmark off half inch spaces along yourlines Or if you make a border of alternate large and small nails say fiveeighths of an inch and three eighthsof an inch in diameter then you haveonly to mark off these spaces on theline and no difficulty ought to present itself A good deal of the effectwould be obtained by using differentsized nails The center part of a linefor instance in a leaf might be of fivenails This sort of decoration is mostpermanent as nothing short of pullingthe nails out will destroy it The design for a tea table top is so simple thata child miglit try it with success N

Sf0 pounds oflime 25 of potash and 20 of phosphoricacid might well be advertised and soldwith profit These ashes are obtainedby burninglimestone with wood Theyare very useiui on crops liKe clover orgrass and farmers who live where theycan be obtained can well afford tc pay350 per ton and haul them home Asfor ordinary unbleached wood ashesthey should never be bought by thebushel They should be bought notonly by weight but on a guaranteedanalysis of potash and phosphoric acidThe Massachusetts Experiment stationchemists found all the way from oneto 35 per cent of water in differentsamples of such ashes It is folly tobuy ashes by the bushel when 20 percent or more of the bulk is nothingbut water The potash and phosphoricacid found in wood ashes have poundfor pound about equal commercial values uealers sometimes state only thesura of both instead of the amount ofeach This is well enough in figuringthe money value of the ashes but thebuj er should demand in addition adefinite statement

distancewest of Myers Hole which is near the NorthMountain station At Myers Hole the linewas changed taking out some very objectionable curvature and the roadbedraised nearly fifteen feet eliminating twogrades of 42 feet per mile which came together at Myers Hole and substituting therefor nn almost level track This point on theroad has always been a dangerous one andmany freight wrecks have occurred thereApart from doing away Avith the dangerousfeature of two sharp down grades comingtogether as was the case in this instancethe saving in operation of the road by thechange will be very large as it enables thetons per train to be greatly increased andreduces the liability of accident to the minimum At Tablers the road bed has beenlowered about 13 feet and the same atTabbs besides taking out objectionable curvature and reducing the rate of grades atthese points from 42 feet per mile to 10 leetmile thus increasing the cars that canEer hauled per train Though these improvements

appearto do something miraculous occasionally is that there is after all very littleoriginality in criminals said one ofChief Hazens sleuthhqunds recentlyWhen a man sets out to get moneyby crooked means he seldom sits downand evolves a new plan On the contrary he evidently thinks of the smartcases he has heard of at different timesmakes up his mind which suits himbest and copies the plan adopted veryclosely indeed vHence when the detective sets outhe has in many instances quite astring of precedents to take as guides tothe course the criminal will probablypursueOne case years ago that helped meimmensely in the business was a forgery The man had disappeared and leftno clew whatever behindI obtained access to his room andfound that he had developed a partiality for cutting scraps from newpapersThere was a whole drawerfnl of theseand I went through them carefullySeveral had relation to forgerycases and one cutting that appeared tobe pretty badly fingered described howa forger had got away in womans attireI worked on the theory that mybird had flown in this manner and followed it up until I finally cot on thetrack and captured the criminalThe capture was regarded as a very jremarkable one but as a matter offact the runaway had left for me anexceedingly valuable clew If he hadtaken the precaution to burn that cutting ho might have escaped capture altogether Cincinnati
