suppressed excitementt the stock yards here Monday Justwhat effect the decision will have onthe methods of business at the yards inthe future is a matter of conjectureSome members of the exchange saythe dissolution of the exchange will bea severe blow to the live stock interestsif it stands the tests of the highercourts They say that the business ascaiyied on under the rules of the exchange has been reduced to a scientificbasis and guarantees to every patronan honest deaLPresident John C McCoy saidWe are in the hands of our lawyersand until we see them we do not knowwhat action will be taken by the ex-change One fact we do not know now5 the full import of the decision and arein no position to say what we can doJudge Foster defines the inter statelaw and saysIt is indisputable that all the livestock shipped to these defendants forsale from states other than Kansas orMissouri after it has entered the current of commerce between the statescontinue and remain subjects of suchcommerce until the transportation isterminated and the property becomes apart of the general property of thestate It is also well settled thatwhile this property is the subject- of interstate commerce no statemunicipality or other power but congress can impose taxes restrictions orregulations upon it except so far as isproper in the exercise of police regulations for the protection of the healthmorals and person of the citizen andexcept for proper charges andtions for the use of local instrumentsas aids or incidents to such commercesuch as docks bridges wharves elevators ferries pilotage etcThe case was that brought by theUnited States district attorney nearlya year ago when Greer Mills Co aChicago Kansas City firm was drivenfrom the exchange The firm waspended for the non payment of finesaggregating 1000 and sued for an injunctionThe association is located on theKansas Missouri line in the- v ate vicinity of- the Kansas City StockI Yards Cos vards The decision declares that the exchange is clearly acombination whose purpose is to restrict control and monopolize the buy-ing and selling of live stock at the Kansas City yards and continuesThe methods and aims of many ofthese exchanges and boards of tradeare not altogether beneficial to thabusiness and commerce of the countryThe crying complaint of to day andthe great menace to the welfare of thepeople is the tendency of wealth tomonopolize and control by trusts andcombines the products and industriesof the country and it must be confessedilsj by every thoughtful observer thatlany of the so called stock

adventure in the storm and indisposedto ride by reason of the lingering- lameness of her wrist she had kept ratherclosely to her room until now seeingnothing of Harvey Neil She caughther breath sharply the hot flush deepening upon her cheeks as she saw himsweeping the hotel with a keen glanceguessing that his thought might be ofher and devoutly thankful for thescreen of lace which afforded her safecovert to watoh him undetected Hehad exchanged his miners clothes fora well fitting suit of gray with Tussetleggings to his knees wearing a softgray hat by no means so disreputablein appearance as the one that hadframed his head the other day Hehad been good looking then but hewas handsome now as ihe stood talkingwith the doctor his attitude instinctwith the unconscious grace of splendidly developed strength as he slightlyleaned against his horse with one handcaressing its neck Something was evidently amiss with one of the animalshind legs at which the doctor was looking the two men standing for severalmoments in earnest discussion of thetrouble after which they disappearedwithin the shop togetherDorothy could hardly have told themeaning of her sigh as after a littleshe saw him come out and ride awayl back over the road lie had icome Shehad rso far recovered from her rancorthat he no longer appeared to her theunprincipled adventurer her unbridledindignation had first assumed that herfathers enemy necessarily must beHer father had said that the youngman might well be honestly mistakeneven averring that in Neils place hisattitude might have been the sameShe was glad to accept this justificationfor him It reinstated her worlds fairhero in her respect although she couldnot feel that it narrowed the gulf whichcircumstances had brought betweenthem To assume that he was the victim of error was to say that he heldhonestly to the belief that her fatherwas no better than a common thiefTo call it misunderstanding could notalter the fact of his actual attitudeand so long as this was so Dorothyfelt that any friendship between themmust be out of the question For herfathers daughter from his standpointof belief he could hardly have evencommon respect to give while as herfarther s daughter it seemed clear toher that she could show no favor tothis Ifteryey Neil without in a way beinga traitor to her fathers cause Butwhile this conclusion appeared to hersimply inevitable she knew in herheart that she was sorry for it knewthat in spite of herself she must acknowledge a sort of willful liking forhim which cold reason had not powerto argue downShe was roused from her revery bya scraping of chairs on the wooden sidewalk outside the window and reminded of the walk she had been going totake was starting upstairs to fetch herhat when she was diverted from thepurpose again by the remark of an unseen speaker who had just establishedhimself there in the shadePears like that horse of Neils iskinder goin back on him he drawlingly observed punctuating the reGnark by a sibilant expectoration oftobacco juice far out into the streetHe does have such luck that fellerSeems like everything is jest natchellyforeordained to go back on him the minute he gits aholt of itSandy though never loses his gripanother voice lazily supplemented accepting the first statement as beyondargument Speaking of that ihowsthatcase of his with the colonel cominout dyou thinkWell I aint bettin on that at thisstage of the game was the responsein a tone expressive of the speakersconfidence that he was cannily up tosnuff but if I wsut my money wouldgo down on thecolonel sure Hes nbird that old duffer If you have anydealins with ihim you want to git uppretty early in the mornin n hang onto theendof the rope thats got the knotin it or it will be slippin through

about thatAll Im sayin is that the colonel saysthe veins hisn n what the colonelsays generally goes with a jury Ive noticed Hes got a way with him thatseems to catch emCatches em in their pocketslaughed the other appreciativelySure N if Neil thinks hes playinagainst a square game well probablyhe knows bettern that Everybodyknows what the colonel is N when itcomes to goin to law aginsthim wellNeils bitten off moren he can chawin my opinion And here for the moment the argument pausedDorothy turned away from the window walking the length of the roomwhere she stopped blankly staring ata group of enlarged photographs massively framed in black walnut faces sounprepossessing that in an undercurrent of thought she was dully marveling that family affection could be solacking in family pride as thus to expose thern to public view But whilestriving to believe that the conversationto which she had just listened hadleft her wholly unmoved that she heldit as altogether beneath her notice sheknew that she was trembling withangry excitement She fairly burnedwith wild desire to go out and silencethose calumniating tongues with suchscathing reproach as now in her perturbation she could hardly compose inher own mind It was monstrous incredible that she should be called tolisten to such arrant falsehood such unconscionable slander She was almostblinded with the anger that possessedher as she stood there determinedlystaring at that ill favored group of photographs and yet as she grew somewhat calmer it was straight back to thewindow that she went Woman likeshe could not resist the impulse to knowthe worst that might be saidShe had no compunction of conscience in thus playing the role of eavesdropper So far as she thought aboutit at all in her disturbed condition ofmind it was to argue that a conversation thus carried on on the public sidewalk could hardly assume to be privatein its nature As in honor bound shecoughed slightly to give notice of herpresence as she resumed her seat butthe cough was very gentle and if shehad been disposed to self examinationshe must have owned herself relievedwhen presently the voices went on unheedinglyI always thought twas McCreadyput the colonel up to that job in thefirst place one was now meditativelyobserving You mind he was workinin the Mascot when they run acrossthat slipin the hangrn wall n twasthen I- reckonshe seehis chance Hewrites off to the colonel to give him abond n lease on the Grubstake n thatputs the colonel onto the fact that theold claim might be wuth sothin nover he comes n looks the groundover n they fix up some kind of a dealbetween em McCready is superintendent of the mine n up he goes sinkina shaft in the toughest ground everwas no sort of show of mineral at allbut that dont feaze McCready Heknows what hes about N pretty soonhes drif tin straight in the direction ofthat little no account crack in the Mascot hangin wall n all of a suddenthere he is with both feet Hes strucka true fissure vein that he must nacheliyf oiler right across the Mascots riches Lground Oh I tell you twas McCreadyengineered that dealBut I notice that the colonel wasntfor givin back any thin when Neilcome claimin that the ore was hisnrejoined the other voice dryly But 1spose McCready was at the bottom ofthe job just the same Hes always hadit in for Neil along of that dynamitebusinessYes hes sore about that and nowonder It was a clost shave for McCready If the union hadnt a put inits best licks to save him I reckon heda been in states prison now instead ofswellin round as superintendent of theGrubstake Though s fur as that goesI never quite believed he done itOh nobody believes he done itnow laughed the other Nobody believes he ever set eyes on the old Mascot shaft house But I say whatsthe matter with goin over to Jims nbavin a game of freeze out a proposition which was promptly followedby a shuffling of feet across the streetCHAPTER YIIA little way beyond the hotel at theweVt Windy Gulch appeared to come toan abrupt end its one street dividinginto a couple of no less dusty thoughsomewhat narrower roads of which theone at the right climbed away over thehills to meet the Old Silver trail andvother remote by ways while the otherturned down- among the shadows ofthe cottonwoods by the creek keepingto its wavering company for a mileor more before it was forced to higherlevels on its way to the mining campcf Tomtown This little cottonwoodgrove where the road started was theone touch of sylvan beauty of whichWindy Gulch might boast There wasa great unpainted wooden structurehousing an abandoned process for treating ores just at the left -of the turning point followed by two or threecabins likewise deserted but beyondthis the trees had been left to growold unmolested A little way alongthere was an old Spanish arastra fallento ruins across the creek while theyawning mouths of shallow tunnelshere and there told of somebodys failures but paying leads had never beendiscovered in this quarter and in thesedays Windy Gulch fpr the most partpassed it by unheeding Sometimeslovers came to loiter along its shadedgrass grown road on Sundayaf ternoons-THE BOURBON NEWS FlilDAST SEPTEMBER 24 1897and more rarely yet travelers passedthat way going to or coming from Tomtown but these latter generally choseto go round by the newer and betterroad that turned off down the canyona few miles below so that Dorothy haddiscovered that on weekdays she mightsafety count on never meeting anybodyhereBut it happened on this August afternoon that Harvey Neil had started forTomtown hoping to consummate somesort of bargain by which his slipperycolleague Brigham might be left to hisduty in the forthcoming trial He hadturned aside at Windy Gulch to consultthe doctor about his horse finding thatthe animal had gone lame and be waschagrined to discover when he hadgone a few miles that in common -humanityhe must turn back the troublebeing so aggravated by the bad roadwhich in many places was but a stretchof bleaching bowlders washed bare byspring time floods whence it happenedthat Dorothys solitude on this occasion came to be invaded by the oneperson who most occupied her thoughtsShe had almost forgotten her indignation on her fathers account in the subtlepleasure growing out of the idea thatMcCready was the one person responsible for all the trouble This view ofthe case exactly harmonized with herpreconceived opinion She had instinctively disliked the superintendent of themine from the outset and now shecould take to herself credit for herpenetration Her father had been misled deceived mainly that McCreadymight profit by it might find means togratify a private malice against theowner of the Mascot mine She wasnow impulsively persuaded that Harvey Neil had been really wronged andall because her father had been systematically led to false conclusions by thisarch plotter who had no care for anysacrifice of honor in attaining his ownevil ends If but the proofs might beforthcoming to prove the wrong to 4iduce her father to withdraw and makerestitution while yet there was timeto vindicate his real moral blamelessnessHarvey Neil had dismounted to sparethe horse and for a mile or more hadbeen plodding along leading the animal when just at a turn in the roadas he came down into the little cottonwood grove he stopped short in surprise at sight of Miss Meredith seatedby the roadsideThe hills had here crowded down oneither side of the narrow creek greatrock masses joining hands as thoughit had been purposed to hold back thehurrying water which but in madderjoy as it seemed went leaping overthe low barriers in a series of foam--7Curious aa be was to know how she would greethim he would gladly have lingereding waterfalls churned to whitenessand shimmering like liquid opal inthe caressing sunshine Here the roadhad been blasted out of the solid rockat one side and the debris so formedheaped up into a low wall along thewaters edge and here it was the girlwas sitting so lost in thought as tobe utterly deaf to the advancing stepsabove the swishing and rushing of thestreamNeil had thought the day of thestorm that Miss Meredith must lookher best in her riding habit but today in the simple cotton gown she woreshe seemed to him even more daintilylovely Ten times more charming thanher fathers crabbed and hes composed of harshness he quoted underhis breath loitering all he might inthe pace that must presently bring himbeside her Curious as he was to knowhow she would greet him he yet wouldgladly linger to enjoy the pretty picture she made all unconscious of anyobserverBut she seemed to feel his glance binstinct looking up with a startled airwhich changed to a flashing smile ofwelcome as she recognized him blushand smile so surprising to Harvey Neilthat as he stopped short in the roadhe had hardly presence of mind to lifthis hat By no stretch of theimagination could he have counted upon suchgreeting as this after her stern arraignment the other dayI beg pardon Miss Meredith Ihope I didnt frighten you he presently found tongue to say with a doubtful deprecating smileOh not at all only one never meetsanybody here you know There couldbe no mistaking the friendliness of hermanner and Neils face grew brighterI am an exception to prove the ruleyou see he said I hope you dont-mindNo I am glad toaneet you she hesitantly returned to his further amazement I want to apologizeTo apologize you I cannot possibly imagine why Miss Merediththough if it makes you the least bit gladto see me of course I am thankful forthe notion whatever it is But it is Iwho should apologize It has been onmy tmind ever since I met you howmean it was of me to mislead you soto enjoy your kindness under false pretenses I told you the other day that Iwas not sorry that Tnever should bebut all the TrbihIthink I knew that IvTMwbound to beashamed of myselfsooner or laterBut I do not think it was so veryheinous murmured the girl with alittle smile as she resumed her seatupon the rock seeming not to notice anafter a -doubtful glance at her he venturedalso to establish himself on aitadjoining bit of wall It would havebeen worse if you had pretended thatyou did not know my name as youmight easily have doneQlji no I could not for you told meyourself if you will remember Youwere so kind But you are kinder nowMiss Meredith if you really forgive meI was afraid the other day that younevervwouldI was taken by surprise the otherday she hurriedly rejoined her eyesupon the flowers in her hand which shehaXl been rearranging And I knew solittle about the trouble between papaairid you I always do know so littleof papas business Of this I had onlyan idea that somebody was trying toprovethat he had stolen a vast sum ofmoney out of that somebodys tmineclaiming that he was in fact little betterthan a common thief Naturally I didnot feel very kindly disposed towardthat somebodyBut now your views have modifiedhe eagerly questionedI think I understand the case a little better she hesitatingly returnedavoiding his glanceIt is so kind of you to say that Hewas silent a moment absently gathering up from tine road a few pebbleswhich he threw one by one into thenearest waterfall And do you knowMissMeredith much as I have alwaysregretted the trouble between themines I have never regretted it so muchas now since meeting you againThen if that is so she impulsivelyreturned only the deepening flush upon her cheeks betraying consciousnessof the confession as it related to herselfwhy will you not try to put an end toit Why will you not see any fatherand explain the matter from your standpoint have a clear understanding andsettle it all up witlhout any moretroublesome law business I am sureit would be

and that is in factthe sort of bed that is commonly usedon the water on all sorts of craft Abunli takes up less room on a vesselwhere space is of great value and thespace can be further utilized by placing one bunk above anotherThere are however some exceptionsto this common rule there having longbeen on some lines of travel on inlandwater boats some of whose stateroomsare provided with beds on regular bedsteads and thenewest of the great oceanjpassenger steamers now have each anumber of rooms fitted up justasasleejing room would be in a finehotel ashorea bedstead being of course a part ofthe equipmentUntil within very recent years it isprobable that no transatlantic steamerpommander had a bedstead in his noomand there are but a very few who havenow The captain sleeps usually upon a tcouch a sort of ample lounge upon-which his bed is made and upon whichhe can take a nap at other times asopportunity offers On the latest greatpassenger steamers a handsome brassbedstead has been placed in the captains room It is doubtful howeverwhether the cajitain makes much useof this at sea in the crowded watersof the North Atlantic and in the badAveather he is very likely to get butlittle sleep and to take what little hedoes get with his clothes onIt is probable that the best providedfor man afloat in respect to sleeping accommodations is the American shipcaptain On many American deep-watersailing vessels of large size the cabimis of ample dimensions as it may easily be with the space at command andcarrying few or no passengers thisspace is utilized for the benefit of thocaptain and the officers On such aship the captains room would be a roomof ample size and a part of its equipment would be a regular full sized bedstead The bedstead is of course fixedin position so that it will not shift withthe motion of the ship at sea It isplaced on ihe side of the room towardthe stern of the ship and with theLead toward the stern so that the captain sleeps with his feet toward thebow of the shipSuch a bed on a sailing ship is usuallyniade with four high corner posts tosustain a mosquito canopy if one shouldbe needed in any of thevarjous latitudesthrough which the ship may pass onher long voyages Under the bed thespace is filled in solid with lockers opening on each side like bureau drawersThe sideboards of this bed are maderather deep they afford a slight degreeof protection against rolling out butnot much The bed is not in this re-spect built as bunks ordinarily are being wider high sides are less neededand if the ship heeled enough to makeBides necessary to keep a man in bedthe captain wouldnt be there at allbut on deck N Y SunReflections of a SpinsterA man whom a dog will trust is neverwholly badWoman has three weapons flatteryfood and

storyYou know every circus has a lionking or queen and the queen especially is a trump cardi always The MsCs had such a one a pretty littlewoman who looked as though she wouldscream at a mouse but who -went intothe cages and ordered the lions andc1 fjious look that women get and wasfrailer thaiu when first knew her Iwondered if our rods were all right andwent behind the scenes to ask Yes thework was excellent and had lasted wellbut alas she had had a grand desolation Guisseppe I remembered Guisseppe was dead I hadnt given athought of Guisseppe since I had seenhim last tout I understood that shemeant the old man I said yes andwas duly sympathetic I never hurt awomans feelings if I can help it Therewas suck a troubled look in her eyesthat it made me want to help her Thelittle woman was as straight as a stringand I was sorry when she quit the MsCs for the proprietors are a goodsort as square as circus men can beI asked her if I might call and talk overold timesCertainly would I be so goodSo the next day between performances Iwent to the address she gave mea second class but passably respectabletheatrical boarding house She seemedglad to see me and talked freely in thateager way women do who have no oneto confide in Guissepe was a greatloss His death left her absolutely without a protector and there was a man inthe company who persecuted her hewished to marry her and she abhorredhim Fortunately there was no oneelse since her suitor had sworn that ifshe should smile on a rival he wouldkill her and she believed he wouldI had my advice to offer peoplehardly guess how much it is I meet erally have I urged her either to gohome to Italy sne naa some munuysaved or to return to the Ms CsI thought she seemed to like the lastsuggestion and I gathered that if thecircus

their happiness was caused be-cause Deputy Sheriff C P Trimble hasa big heart and also a big watermelonpatchMr Trimbles watermelon patch issituated in East Point and for somedays a squad of 90 negro convicts hasbeen working on the road that runs bythe forbidden fruit For days the songthat the poor devils would sing to therattling of their chains was somethingabout the inferiority of all the fruitsof the earth compared to the watermelon ending with the plaintivechorusOh gimme oh gimme I really wishyou would dat watermelon groin onde vineThe other day their song was answered It was raining and they couldnot work and Mr Trimble orderedCapt Duncan who has charge of themto turn them in and let them eat theirfill Capt Duncan knew better than toturn 90 hungry convicts right into afield of melons for he wanted to savethe vines arid he knew that they wouldeat vines and all so he selected severalof the trusties and sent them up tothe field with a big two horse wagonThose trusties knew what they had todo and if one wagon ever had a loadof melons that one did When it rolledinto camp there was a kind of lull thatcomes before a storm only a momentfor the melon hungry negroes to graspthe situation and then the massacrelbeganThere were no knives to cut them upwith There were no dainty slices likeone sees in a boarding house It waslike a swarm of locusts turned loose ina grain

there in much bet- was on the way back to the field forter spirits intensely grateful still moreing the lions and tigers with the moral J Oliver Twist wasnt in it when itsuasion of red hot steel I came to calling for more with theseOnly Bengal the tiger who had hungry convicts When the wagoncame back with 200 or 300 more theBOTH BEASTS WERE UPON HER AT ONCEtigers around in a way to make yourhair stand on endShe carried a little rattan just sucha cane as dndes used to delight in before they took to lugging around sticksas big as themselves It astonishedeverybody to see how afraid thosebeasts were of that slight wand Thenewspaper reporters said it was thepower of the human eye but after Ihad seen her once or twice I made upmy mind that the eye wasnt in it andthat the cane was every time Once atFrankfort the biggest tiger as uglya brute as you would care to keep outof the way of sprang at her in a fashionthat made one woman in the audiencefaint and a dozen shriek She neverflinched though the tiger set his teethinto her left shoulder she just gave itthe rod until the beast let go howlingThe men rushed in and shut the innerdoor but she had saved herself beforethey got tli ere1 asked no questions but I had somecuriosity about that cane and it wasa satisfaction when one day MdlleLeonie that was her name requesteda private interview with hie Shebrought an old man with her some sortof relation who was as faithful ain The Bride of Lammermoor He went to every door andwindow to make sure there was no oneeavesdropping and then stood at thedoor outside to prevent our being interrupted Of course the conversationwas albout the cane The mystery likeall mysteries was simple enough whenyou knew it The rattan was hollowand lined with asbestos which wasmuch less used then than it is nowInside the rattan was a steel rod whichby pressing a spring could be made toprotrude beyond the ferule The oldman heated the rod to white heat bfore each performance and its touchwas torture no wonder the beasts hadlearned to dread it- Much burning had injured the rodsthesecould have been renewed withoutbetraying the secret but of late theholder had seemed out of order and theheat hurt her handI assured her that the matter couldbe fixed without sending to Italy promised secrecy and made a special trip toNew York to see that the cane had anew lining properly put inSome months after that my lionqueen left the Ms Cs to join a dimemuseum in an eastern city and it wasa year or more before I saw her ThenI chanced to be in that city on businessfor the firm and seeing her name on theposters I took a couifty friend to seethe show She was as great a successas ever but she had that worriedwounded her had neither forgotten iiorforgiven He would be glad to do hera mischief Then there was also another beast a recent purchase who wassulky and ill conditioned so that if oncethe rod was not quite hot Howevershe had a spirit lamp in her dressingroom and heated it herself there couldbe no danger And in the winter shewas going home to Italy Her aunthad written her of a pretty little farmwhich could be bought for a sum within her means There were only neededa few more dollars to stock itAccordingly in the autumn posters ofthe circus there was a two f oat letteredannouncement of the farewell engagement of Mdlle Leonie before her finalretirement from the arena and returnto ItalyWhen I saw her she was in a greatfright Her obstreperous lover hadcome to see her and was threatening allmanner of terrible things unless shegave up the idea of leaving America and agreed to marry him at onceThat night I was with two or threecustomers and as there was nothingelse of any account going on wc strolledinto the circusIt is a very good show but I haveseen it so often that I am pretty wellused to it Besides I was thinking ofother things When the lion queencame on however my companions wereso much interested that I roused upShe went through her act wi th the lionswho seemed rather to like her in fineform but when she came on for thetiger act I felt uneasy the brutes hada wicked look that I thought bodedtrouble Still the familiar rod was inher hand and I took a professionalpride in that rodI can hardily tell you how it happened Such things take place in aflash Both beasts were upon her atonce snarling and growling like devilsincarnate How she did lay on withthat rod It seemed impossible thatanything with sensation could standso much red hotsteel Good God wasit possible they had snatched it fromher and broken it in pieces I rushedin with the attendants who hurriedinto the cage with goads andiwhips anddrove the brutes off but it was too lateAfter it was all over 1 picked up thebroken rattan Then I understood Itwas only an ordinary cane like anyother an exact copy of ours but without the inner rod The villainhad beentalking to her just before she came onfor the last act and- of course he hadmanaged to substitute it for hers Isuppose she was scared out of her witsand so did not notice But how are yopgoing to prove itmelons that had gone before had beenforgotten and the second onslaught began It was more stubborn and a little longer but the victory was just ascompleteOld negroes that had not tasted a bitof the red fruit since last year wouldgrab a melon give it one affectionatehug and then let us draw a curtainover the

was addressed to a publicwagon stand to be delivered to thedriver of a gray horse with a coveredfurniture wagon the wagon beingpainted green It was the last wordthat secured the delivery for it

times duringthe day and though white horses worein evidence each time I was there thegreen painted wagon did not -show lipuntil my last trip I delivered the letter It was an order for the drive tomove

shecannot do and they know why Theconquest of China has not turned theirheads They knew they would win before they went to war for they werewell informed of Chinas weakness andof their own strength

affectionately and generallyknownYes Im Dan Hibbard declared thegray haired man laying aside his pipeas the newspaper man made his inquiryOldest lock tender Well yes oldestin service There are a few men olderin years than I be but none of them hasserved 40 years at a post of this kindBut Ive been servin on the canal for50 years altogether for Heft my fathersfarm when I was 16 and drove a team ofhorses on the ditch I was mighty gladto get away from the toils of the farmand I thought it was fun driving horsesfor 12 a month and board on the boatBefore his long term as lock tenderbegan Hibbard saw a little packet boatlifeRiding on board a packet was aluxury too I can tell you recalled MrHibbard None of these Wagners orPullmans were finer for downrightcomfort and for sociability of the passengers I never saw anything that surpassed a packet People became thoroughly acquainted for sometimes theywere together for several days Thepassengers slept and ate on the boatand the service was always good Therewere four lines running in those daysThere was a line from Buffalo to Rochester another from Rochester to Syracuseanother from Syracuse to Utica and thefourth was from Utica to SchenectadyThere was no packet line from Schenectady to Albany for two reasons Thefirst was that too much time had to beconsumed in passing the nine locks atSchenectady and the second reasonwas that there were but few towns ofany importance along the line Stagecoaches ran through the country ofcourse so that Albany was not entirelyisolated from the rest of the worldEvery daj a boat used to leave fromRochester in the morning and everynight there would be another Thehorses would go on a trot so that pretty good time was made The boatthat left Rochester in the morningwould get in Buffalo the same nightfind the boat that left at night wouldreach its destination the followingmorning The day boats served mealswhile the night boats were providedwith sleeping accommodations Onehundred and fifty persons could bewell taken care of at nightThe meals were good and the boatcaptains used to buy fruit cheap fromthe fanners Peaches were 25 cents abushel and plums and apples wereworth barely anything There were abarber shop and bar on board Everything at the bar was three cents exceptbrandy that was sixpence Most of thepassengers on the day boats would rideon deck to see the beautiful countrythrough which the canal passedThe ride from Rochester to Buffalowas especially enjoyable on account ofthe great sandstone quarries at Medinaand the fine sight of the big locks atLockport There the boats had to overcome an elevation of 200 feet The roarof the water used to frighten timid passengers The fare was three cents amile with board on the boat and also aberth Thus in two days a personcould make the journey from Schenectady to Buffalo and have a fine time onthe waySometimes we had trouble especially at the locks There were single locksaltogether then and the boat that arrived locked through save whenthere were packet boats and these weresupposed to have the right of way Oncein awhile the men on the packet boatwould have to fight for the lock andthen there would be a high

have fathers as well asmothers That is a fact of natural history which we do not suppose the mostadvanced of the crovyds -who are nowwriting about women and their progressare prepared definitely to deny but theywould certainly like to deny it if theycould The assumption which underlies all their views is that women arenot only different from men physicallyintellectually and morally but hntthey belong to a different race whichmay as time advances have a destinyof its own They write as if the greatHindu legists who hold that femaleproperty should descend only to females had perceived part of a greattruth which is that women are continuously separate from men inheritnothing from them and are forever advancing upon a line of their own whichwill in the end or at all events mayin the end after what Mrs Green callsjvan anarchic period develop in themLrosomething probably superior to any vLthing in men or at the worst something radically differentThe human race with these writers ismale but -women are female and there-fore something quite other than human Their strength and their weakness their virtues and their failings belong to themselves and no more belongto a common humanity than the qualities of cattle and the qualities of thef elidae belong to a common animal nature They have a different line as wellas a different law of progress and willin the end develop into beings entirelyseparate -from men probably muchhigher but at all events so differentthat to reason from the progress of onesex to the progress of the other is asfutile as to reason that because wolveshave in the course of unnumbered agesdeveloped into dogs therefore catmust in the course of countless aeondevelop into dogs also In the violenceof their recoil from the Tennysouiauidea that woman is but lesser man thmore fanatical writers attribute to herqualities faculties and above all a future fate which would if their assumption were true prove her to belong tnan essentially different species whichresembles man only for a momeutwhen as it were accidentally she iilevel with him in a race in which she iadestined to be far the first The factthat as all men are the sons of womenthey must share in any inherited excellence or even change which theirmothers may devplop is not so much denied as ignored and the whole questionis treated as if all men Avere the descendants of Adam and all women

pick up on it The longer the hogis kept after cold weather sets in themore expensive the animal is We likeio fatten quickly and send to marketand we can feed all the corn the hog willeat from the stage above describeduntil the animal is ready to market Wefeed nothing but corn during the fattening season If the animal has beenon good pasture and fed a lot of millstuffs during the summer it needs nothing of this kind if it is fattened quickly Of course the laying on of fat mustbe considered as a diseased conditionDuring the fattening process the hog ishot feverish and as the fat accumulates the organs are oppressed and iffed nothing but fattening food thebones and muscles get very little nourishment but that will do no particularharm unless the process is continuedfoi a long time If it is the animalought to be fed some millstuff s or something like them All the time the hog isbeing fattened it should have plenty ofgood pure water Swill will not answerIf you ever had a fever jtou wanted water not milk not tea or coffee just water The fat hog feels exactly like thatAs to keeping swine for a better market everyone must be his own judge Ithink it is best to get them off as soon aspossible It is all expense to keep hogsafter they are fat enough to kill and thequestion is simply this Can you affordto be at the outlay of keeping hogs amonth or two for what

itoccurs in rare instances and a supposedcase recently excited considerable comment In its most malignant form thedisease exists in oriental countriesCattle and occasionally horses are attacked by it In these animals it manifests itself as a splenic fever Man inany climate may fibe inoculated withanthrax If his hand should have anabrasion and be brought in contact withhides infected with anthrax bacilli thedisease is likely to manifest itself ascontagious carbuncle malignant pustule or wool sorters and hair combersdisease If there is rapid treatment byexcision of infected flesh after inoculation the patient may recover Unlesstreatment is speedy virulent local inflammation attended with sloughingand speedy -system poisoning resultsThere is great prostration after inoculation and

practice of soilingExperiments recently made at theMichigan experimental station showthat about four times as much food isobtained from a meadow allowed to mature hay as from a field pastured Insoiling the difference would probablynot be so great owing to the fact thatthe grass of peas or alfalfa or whateveris grown for the purpose is cut beforeit fully matures hut even then fromtwo to three times the number tif animals can be supported by soiling as onpastureTlie Ulan AVho SucceedsThe man who succeeds with any kindof live stock is the one who is interestedthat is in the business

on theCost of the FoodIf a farmer has a flock that must beconfined in yards and fed twice a day itis doubtful if the eggs received will-more than pay for the food consumedThe estimate of the cost of eggs is basedon the fact that the amount necessaryto be expended on a laying hen for oneyear provided all food must be allowedher from the storehouse of the owneris one dollar while the average numbeiof eggs laid by each hen during oneyear is estimated at 100 This makesevery egg cost one cent But it doesnot cost one dollar a year for each henexcept where they must be kept underadverse conditions Hens on farmsGost the farmers not over 25 cents a hena year because the hens are self-supportingduring a portion of the timeand also because they consume and utilize a great many substances thatpossess no value to the farmer It istrue that the hens occupy land that isusually devoted to some crop such aagrass iruit etc ana wnicn may alsobe occupied by the fowls entirely Theprofit from eggs must depend on thecost of the food and the prices obtained There is a wide difference between 12 cents and 20 cents a dozen foreggs and if we estimate the cost of anegg at one cent the difference of onecent a dozen in the price obtained maychange a profit to a loss or nothing tall There are hundreds of farmers whosell eggs at only eight cents a dozenowing to distance and lack of transportation facilities to market but the costof the eggs is correspondingly as lowhence the actual cost of an egg dependsnot only on tiie cost of the food but theconditions affecting the keeping oipoultry East of the Mississippi riverfarmers should have no difficulty insecuring good prices compared withthe cost It is not the winter eggs thatpay best for thej may bring highprices and be scarce The eggs
