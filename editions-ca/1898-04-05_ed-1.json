I was discharged from the army on

Many Trials of an Englishman With His
Stenographer
An Englishman who drops his hs
and aspirates his as and a stenographer
and typewriter who spells phonetically
from dictation make a combination
from which trouble is sure to result nn
less the copy is carefully revised
The manager of one of the most impor
tant manufacturing plants in Cleveland
is an Englishman Not long ago he em
ployed a young man to act as his stenog
rapher and one of the first things that
the latter was called npon to do was
the taking down of a letter to the
managers wife who was away at a
summer resort Being a busy man the
manager didnt take the trouble to look
at the letter after it had been l5oo
ten but when his wife answered it
there was a hot time for the stenogra
pher My dear Henry she wrote
what on earth do you mean by calling
me Hannah and our little Horace
Orris I will admit that this sounds
like you but why do you make a joke
of it before your employees
Of course the fond husband and fa
ther didnt know what it all meant and
so he wrote for an explanation when
his first letter was sent back to him
One glance at it and he rushed over
to his stenographer excitedly threw the
sheet down before him and demanded
There what do you mean sir by
writing my wifes name down An
nah
Anna replied the young man
Let me see No Ive got it Hannah
all right
But said the manager who was
furious its not Annan it
Hannal
Well there it is Hannah
Annah be dashed exclaimed
manager Hanua Cant you
Yon Cannot Fail to Appreciate the Point
In This Story
Once a farmer had 1800 bushels of
wheat which he sold not to a single
grain merchant but to 1800 different
dealers a bushel each A few of them
paid him in cash but far the greater
saie tnere Me bad only been dreaming
Moral The next day the man went
to the publisher of his paper and said
Here sir is the pay for your paper
performing their duties in a very expe
ditious manner and he commented on
ing an alibi Some time afterward the
judge met him and said Well Lock
wood that was a very good alibi
Yes my lord was the answer L
had three offered me and I think I se
lected the best
Evart and Mark Twafiu
At a New England society dinner
some years ago Mark Twain had just
finished a piquant address when Mt
Evarts arose shoved both of his hanis
down into his
trousers pockets as was
his habit and laughingly remarked
Doesnt it strike
this company as a
little unusual that a professional hu
morist should be funny Mark Twain
waited until the laughter excited by
this sally had subsided and then
drawled out Doesnt it strike this
oompany as a little unusual that a law
yer should have his hands in Ma own
pockets Exchange
