All over the country pledges were

pledges now. Kentucky should take
the lead. County Chairmen should
realize that their work was not com

but was only fairly begun.
Utilize August and September in
following up the pledges. Do it by
school districts. Let every signer
know his record of performance is
heing watched.
See that every pledge is fulfilled,
and then see that it is doubled if
possible.
Kentucky must invest in War Sav

the year.
THE PATHOL SYSTEM OF ROAD
MAINTENANCE.
Although the patrol system of
maintenance has been in vogue tw all
the older countries for decades and
been adopted by many States in our
own country, recommended by. all
highway engineers, advocated in all
leading road magazines, favored by
most leading citizens, strongly en
dorsed by all State Highway Depart
ments, less than half a dozen counties
in Kentucky have adopted it. What
is the reason? -
Whenever and wherever it has been
tried, it has never been a failure,rthe
results accomplished being wonder
ful and the expense incurred being
a minimum.
The system has long since passed
the experimental stage and should
there be any county officials who
doubt its practicability, they can
easily ascertain the facts by a little
correspondence.
Let us seek information instead of
approval of antiquated methods and
the verdict must be the patrol sys
tem for every jmain traveled road in
Kentucky.

A PICTURE OF THE DRAFT
(Gordon Snow, in the Atlantic)
A frail little chap he was, so
young and boyish for all his one-and-twenty
years. There was that
about him which spoke of knicker
bockers and romping childhood laid
aside but yesterday. I did not know
Joe. He had passed through the mill
of the draft as one of many; but we
met for a brief sixty seconds on fine
spring night at the station, just as
the train was taking him away; and
while memory lives, I shall remember
Joe.
He looked down at me from a car
window, and as he said good-bye
there was a twinkle in his eye as if
he was amused that I did not know
him.
"Say good-bye to Mary Jane for
me," he called as the train moved
out.
"Who are you?' I cried, springing
alongside the moving car.
"Ha!" he laughed: 'I'm the gro
cer's boy. Every day I came to your
back door. Mary Jane knows me and
so does the missus. Say good-bye to
both of them for me.' "
The train clicked away into the
night. I turned back, swallowing a
lump. It so befalls that the light of
my household is a little 2-year-old
and her n&mlfe is Mary Jane.

A new feature at the sixteenth an

event. The premium money is divid
ed into five sums, the first prize be
ing 40 per cent, of the stake, the sec
ond 25" per cent., the third 15 per
cent, and the fourth and fifth each
10 per cent. The nominations m tnis
stake closed July 1, and the entries
were named September 1. Every in
dicatipn points to a record-breaking
struggle for prizes in this ring andjt
is claimed that sopne of the greatest
mule flesh in the State will be on

YOUTHS BETWEEN 18 AND 21 TO
BE MOBILIZED OCT. 1.
Members of the Students' Army
Training Corps, consisting of youths
between the ages of 18 and 21, will
be mobilized October 1 at pore than
300 colleges selected for that purpose
by the War Department, according
to details of the plan announced.
The members -of the Students
Training Corps will be "soldiers on
active duty," a statement issued by
the War Department says. Upon
their induction into service their sub
sistence, quarters, clothing and tui
tion will be provided by the Govern
ment and the student-soldiers will re
ceive the pay of privates in the army.
High school graduates will be eli
gible to the collegiate training di
vision of the corps and grammar
school graduates may enter the vo
cational section. As the students
show ability they will be transferred
to new divisions and those showing
special qualifications will be sent to
officers' training schools. Others will
be' assigned to noncompiissioned offi
cers' schools.
The War Department, in its state
men, advises youths now ready for
college entrance or already enrolled
in college to adhere to their irtans
and obtain voluntary induction into
the corps.

"Watermelons! Red! Ripe! Home
grown watermelons! Fifteen cents!"
Residents of Brazil, Indiana, at first
did not believe their ears. They
looked out, saw a farmer with a
wagonload of melons, and then heard
him repeat the 15 cents. They
"rushed" the wagon. The farmer sold
his load immediately, (many persons
buying seveal melons. Afterward' he
said he had not read the prices of
melons, and had not heard that they
were retailing as high as $1 apiece.
He said he figured, however, after
he had sold thenso cheeply that the
time he saved in disposing of his en
tire load, in about one-quarter of. an
hour, was worth, something to him.
However, he subscribed for, a 5VS"
paper before leaving town.
TOBACCO'S HELP TO HUMANITY
(Cincinnati" Enquirer)
Though the agitation for the State
abolition of the tobacco habit is not
so pronounced as it formerly was, it
is well to remember that the weed
has something to its credit from a
patriotic point of view.
Many believe that the dropping of
propaganda literature behind trench
es and military lines is a modern in
vention. Nothing of the sort. It
was practiced during the War of In
dependence and the tobacco habit
was concerned with ft. In a letter
written by Benjamin Franklin to
Gen. Gates on August 28, 1776, the
information was conveyed that Con
gress had decided to undermine the
loyalty of the Hessian mercenaries in
the British arjmy. This it proposed
to do by printing offers of land to all
those who would change their coats.
Printing the temptation in the
German language the artful authori
ties used the sheets as tobacco wrap
pers and deftly caused' the material
to be captured by the Hessian sol
diers. These innocent victims of su
perior strategy read1 the alluring
wrappers before their officers could
learn the contents and issue a pro
hibition. The apologist for the use
of the weed triumphantly vdraws at
tention to the fact that 12,562 of the
Hessians remained fir this country
at the close of the war. Tobacco, it
will be observed, "did" its bit" for the
cause of liberty, and" should be de
fended now like the famous tree in
the poem.
