More Money From the Same Feed
That's the experience of every farmer who uses Avalon
Farms Hog-Tone. "Tone" a hog and he thrives better.
He assimilates a bigger percentage of his food. He is not
held back in his growth by the dozens of parasites and
disorders that are an ever present menace to his growth.
Read this letter about getting more value from the same
feed.

DEATHS.
'
FOX.
Delayed train connections at
Concinnati with trains from Nev
York prevented the body of Mr
James Fox arriving in Paris until
a very late hour Friday night. The
body was taken to the J. T. Hinton
Co.'s undertaking establishment.
The funeral, which had been ar
ranged for Friday afternoon, was
held Saturday afternoon, at three
o'clock, with services at the grave
in the Paris Cemetery, conducted
by Rev. W- B. Ellis, pastor of the
Paris Christian church. Mr. Fo
died in New York last week, after a
short illness.
ARDERY.
The funeral of Mrs. Ella Ar
dery, whose dead body was found
on the floor of her home at the cor
ner of Vine street and Stoner ave
nue, Thursday afternoon, was held
at the home of her mother, Mrs.
Belle Adair, near Paris, at two
o'clock, Saturday afternoon. Ser
vices were conducted by Rev. Geo.
H. Harris, of Versailles, assisted by
Rev. I. J. Spencer, of Lexington
The pall-bearers were John Towles.
Ollie Hedges, Lawrence Horton, Sid
ney Ardery, Lafayette Ardery, D-.
Harry E. Mathers. The burial fol
lowed in the Paris Cemetery.
Mrs. Ardery was a devoted mother
and a conscientious Christian
whose chief aim in life was to do
good to all around her. In hr
home life she preserved the idea,l
heme atmosphere, and did all in her
power to make those with whom
she associated happy and contented.
To her only child, Mr. Wm. B. Ar
dery, Jr., she was more than mother
friend, counsellei and advisor. In
her passing away the community
loses one whom could not well be
spared and to her family, rela'i'"-'
and friends the loss is irreparable.
Mrs. Ardery was possessed of a
disposition so amiable and lovely
that friends were instantly drawn
to her and retained by her charm of
manner. Her home was one where
genuine hospitality reigned, and in
the language of the poet, "None
knew her but to love her."

of a common belief to the contrary.
