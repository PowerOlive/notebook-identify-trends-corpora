$100 to the county on condition that
it raise an equal amount for the em

WHAT IS THfc INTERNATIONAL?
The International Live Stock Expo
sition, to b.e held at the Union Stock
Yardsc Chicago, Nov. 29 to Dec. 6, is
the world's largest and best show of
live stock.
It is a school of ripe education
ready to use.
It is a stipulator of useful thought
and action.
It is a measure of progress, a mak
er of standards.
It is a guide for breeders, a breeder
of feeders.
Jt is an eye-opener to the public, a
fountain of human interest.
It teaches, inspires, entertains,
awakens and directs.
It reveals the extent and the scope
of the live stock industry, increases
trade, brings men into helpful contact
with one another, and enlarges their
horizon. '
It trains the eye, builds business,
broadens men, and compels improve
ment in live stock.
It affords a pleasurable and profit
able trip.
It encourages beginners in stock
breeding and feeding and imparts
practical information through eye and
ear,
It presents for inspection the best
draft horses, the best cattle of all the
beef breeds, including their grades
and crosses, the best sheep of all the
breeds, with their grades and crosses,
that-the breeders of the United States
and Canada can produce.
It is educationally adapted to the
farmer, the" breeder, the feeder, the
ranchman, the student, the business
man, the women of the farm and the
city, and the public in general.
No person at all interested in the
progress of agriculture can afford to
miss this greatest and first of all the
live stock shows.

There are other ways to success
besides pushing forward. The tum
ble bug pushes his load backward,
but he gets there just the same.

CLEANSES YOUR HAIR
MAKES IT BEAUTIFUL.
It Becomes Thick, Wavy, Lustrous,
and all Dandruff Disappears..
Surely try a "Danderine yHair
Cleanse" if you wish to immediately
double the beauty of yomhair. Just
moisten" a cloth with Danderine and
draw it carefully through your hair,
taking one strand at a time; this will
cleanse the hair of dust, dirt or any
excessive oil in a few minutse you
be amazed. Your hair will be wavy,
fluffy and abundant and possess van
incomparable softness, lustre and
luxuriance.
Besides beautifying the hair, one
application of Danderine dissolves
every partcle of dandruff; invigorates
the scalp, stopping itching and fall
ing hair.
Danderine is to the "hair what fresh
showers of rain and sunshine are to
vegetation. It goes right to the roots
and invigorates and strengthens
them. Its exhilarating, stimulating
and life-producing properties cause
the hair to, grow long, strong and
beautiful.
You can surely have pretty, soft,
lustrous hair, and lots of it, if you
will a just get a 25 cent bottle of
Knowl ton's Danderine from any drug
store or toilet counter and try it as
directed. (adv)
The trouble with the amateur per
former is that his friends nearly
always force him to respond to an
encore.
In Nhuying a new ""hat a woman
loks for one that is becoming. A
man seeks one that will make him
look no worse.

Mabbergast and Glint, he raced four

the envy of any owner, and it may bo
that Horron was quite the best of the
year. At any rate, he won all of his j
races, and, in defeating such as Cal-'
gary, Hawthorn, Buskin, Plate Glass,
ouerwooa, uock o tne wane, arisen-
lan, ignore ana otner good ones, gave
convincing proqf of his superior ex-
cellence. Of the other three, Kle -
Durne was best ana a shitty one when
at his bst. Glintshowed surprising
improvement at Latonia, and prob
ably will be a useful four-year-old.
Young horses that' show at their best
in fall racing are usually good to fol
