PASTCalhoun Clark Was FanLiliar withthe Giants of Long AgoOld Washlagtonlan Han Some Pleasant Recollections of Men Knownto This Generation byName OnlySpecial Washington LetterI can think only of the days of myboyhood says Calhoun Clark a venerable WTashingtonian long retired frombusiness who has many friends and ishighly respectedI have reached that period in lifewhen my recollections of the long agoare more vivid than the recollections ofyesterda and of last week I readwhen a young man that in advancedage the memory would play suchfreaks and now I realize that I am anold man for 1 think constantly of thedays before the warJust at present there is particularreason for this action of my brainwhich you will readily understandXot so very long ago 1 attended thefuneral of the late Senator JustinSmith Morrill of Vermont in the senate chamber and as 1 gazed upon hisvenerable features my mind went backto the year lb50 when he first came toEX SENATOR GORMANJHe Began His Public Career as Page Boyin the Senatecongress as a member of the house ofrepresentatives 1 Mas a page boythen and was growing too large forthe business and soon afterwards theygave me a mans position which I heldlor some timeWhen Senator Morrill came to congress he was one of the most strikingfigures I had ever seen and in fact 1have never since seen any man of finerphysique or more intellectual appearance In the coffin I saw the shriveledform and features of a very old manIn the house of representatives I usedto look up to a man six feet four inchestall with broad shoulders and perfectly proportioned He had heavy wavyblack hair and abundant black whiskers while his carriage was that of agiant He was by far the most attractive looking man in congress I sawhim as he advanced in position until hebecame chairman of the committee onways and means when the tariff act ofthe civil war was named after him Inthose days he was sent for very oftenby President Lincdp rwho consultedhim on all matters of great importancemst as President Mekmlev has beenin the habit of recently seeking counsel of the late Chairman Dingley onfinancial and revenue matters He wasa very great man and was always regarded as a very good man too1 remember when he was elected tothe senate and what a splendid reception he had on the rloor of the house ofrepresentatives when that honor wasconferred upon him The leaden of thehouse regretted to lose him and yetthey were sincerely cjlad of his elevation to the upper house of congress because his abilities warranted the advancement Besides while he was theleader on the floor of the house instead of making political enemies asso many leaders have done he was for-tever increasing the number of his sincere friends by treating all men fairlyThere was another handsome manin the house of representatives at thattime It was George W Jones of IowaHe had been a representative fromMichigan later from Wisconsin andfinally from Iowa and that state alsosent him to the senate Gen Jones hadbeen a great Indian fighter He was aman of splendid physique and Aery attractive manners He was a very warmpersonal friend of Lewis Cass John CCalhoun Henry Clay and Daniel Webster They were together a great dealand they had jolly good times togetherafter the custom of the day for temperance principles were not then invogue as they are now Everybodylived in hotels then and there were fewboarding houses for congressmenWhen John C Breckenridge came tocongress he took precedence over themall because he was not only a handsome man but a gentleman of the mostgenial manners He had an indescribable air which drew men to him andhe was also a ladies man That was notbecause he was particularly a danglerafter the society of the ladies but because the ladies were all after him 1guess that John C Breckenridge wasfor a time the most popular man ineither house of congressThomas H Benton of Missouri wasunpopular in the house of representatives because he was so pompous Hehad served for 30 years in the senatea record which had never before beenequaled When lie came to the house ofrepresentatives he naturally expectedconsiderable consideration because ofhis long career in the senate But inthat he was mistaken Nobody in thehouse of representatives has ever secured deference for what he has beenbut every man there has to stand uponhis own merits and manners It has always been largely a question of manners For example in later yearsJames G Blaine captured everybodywith his manners while Roscoe Conkling repelled men lv his austerityThus it has always been and alwayswill be in the popular branch of con IgressJohn C Calhoun was popular whfUat the same time he was very dignifiedHe knew everybody by name and spoketo everybody but he maintained a dignity which was respected Mr Calhounlived at my fathers house and 1 wasnamed after him He was regarded asthe most studious man in the houseand his statements of fact and of lawwere always accepted just as the statements of John G Carlisle were alwaysacceptedHenry Clay was a friend of the pageboys There were many congressmenwho would not vote a gratuity for thpages and who would try to defeat itBut Henry Clay alwajs stood by us andat the close of each session we usuallysecured an appropriation of 200 eachin gold in addition to our regular salaries Mr Morrill was also our friendand he never tried to prevent the adoption of our annual billDaniel Webster knew all of the pageboys by name and he always spoke ina kindly manner to them In the senate he had an especial favorite ofwhom he was very fond His name w asArthur Gorman Daniel Webster encouraged him to study law and makea man of himself As a result primarily of this interest which DanielWebster took in him young Gormanentered politics and lor the past ISyears he has been a member of thesenate and a leading democratic politician 1 guess the page boy ArthurGorman has been one of the best andablest men in the senate during thepresent generation They tell me toothat Senator Gorman has always beenkind to The page boys never forget- jting that he was at one time in asimilar humble positionWhile Senator Morrill was in thehouse of representatives there was abig man there from Pennsylvania tvhowas handsome able and popular Hisname was Galusha A Grow and hecame from Pennsylvania He was madespeaker of the house and filled theposition with great ability Twentyfive years passed away and I read inthe papers that Galusha A Grow hadbeen elected to the house of representatives in 1S92 I could hardly believeit was the same man and concudedthat it must be a son of ttie samename I waited until the congressassembled and went to Willards hotelevery night to look at the registerFinally 1 found the name cf GalushaA Grow there and it was the samehandwriting that I knew so well asa boy 1 sent up my card and was invited to come to his roomI went up with a bell boy and whenI entered there stood a big man withpartly bald head gray hair graywhiskers and back of them all thesame old face He stepped biiskly forward took my hand and said Wellsir what can I do for youI stood still a minute looking athivr carefully and at last I said AreyoVye same Mr Grow ihat used toi ember of the house ofse - nes wnen l was a dovHe laughed and replied 4I dontknow when you were a boy but I usedGALUSHA A GROWCongressman -at-Large from the State oPennsylvaniato be a member of the house and wasone time speaker of the houseI said You used to remembereverybody there Dont you remember moHe sat down laughed long and loudand finally said You have the bestof me I dont remember the old menbut I remember all of the young menand boys just as well as ever But Idont remember ever having seen youthere or anywhere elseIt was the same old man He hadlived many years but he had not grownold as I had 1 finally said Dontvou remember Cal Clark the pageboyHe jumped up came to me anilsaid I remember that little cuss verywell What has become of himWhen I told him that I was CftlClark he hugged me opened his bosof cigars sent for a bottle of Apollinariawater and invited me to dinner withhim I stayed there until after midnight talking over old

the Tank ofthe OthersThe Bermuda groupers are so calledon account of their habit of groupingtogether There are plenty of fishesthat on occasions by accident or designmay come together side by side or insome other regular order or formationbut there are few if any that get together as the groupers do In the tankof groupers at the aquarium says theNew York Sun these fishes may be seenhalf a dozen or more of them at a timeranged along the glass at the front ofthe tank heads all to the front andwith their bodies lapping one anotherdiagonally with uniform regularitySometimes at feeding time they standor rather suspend themselves in the water side by side in a uniform rankheads up near the surfaee and waitthere for the man with the food whosestep they may have heard on the platform back of the

of rural Englandwhere they still set aside a day forwhipping dogsDog whipping day is October 18Then every boy in the neighborhood isprivileged to arm himself with sticksand lashes and beat every dog he meetsto his hearts content There are different stories as to the origin of thisstrange custom In Yorkshire tradition has it that a priest when going hisrounds many years ago dropped theholy water used in communion serviceA dog that happened to be near byswallowed it and was promptlywhipped for his gulttony and in commemoration of thi6 event it has beendeemed expedient to thrash the entiredog family on this day throughout thesucceeding years In the vicinity ofManchester the tale goes that the goodfathers in a certain monastery used toet platters of food outside the gatesfor the poor pilgrims that infested thecountry at certain seasons On one occasion a dog whose stomach was probably empty as any pilgrims ever darebe very selfishly ate the food himself He was caught in the lawless actand was whipped soundly and hiscrime and its punishment have beenvisited upon his descendants thesemany generationsMexico and the YaqnlsThe struggle between the Vaqui Indians and the Mexican government hasbeen inevitable ever since the construction of the Mexican Central railroadbrought civilization within an easyinarch of the Vaqui territory Withthe extension of the area of gold discoveries in Sonora the conflict could notbe longer averted and it will have a melancholy interest in history as probably the last stand of the red man onthis continent against destiny TheYaqui is not as aggressive or asdoodthirsty as the Apache but he is fullyas impervious to civilization and quiteas good a fighterBirch Wood Exported for SpoolsAbout 10000000 feet of birch woodwill be sent this

trses the Down from Her Bodyto Make a Nest for Her YoungThen DiesThere is something really patheticin the way a mother butterfly builds anest for her children In the first placethe little home where the eggs are deposited represents a great deal of sacrifice for it is lined with several layers of soft down plucked from themothers own soft body The eggrshaving been laid carefully upon thisluxurious pretty couch are protectedby an equally pretty coverlet made ofthe same material These butterfly bedclothes are often arranged with an intricacy that is quite curious and perplexing Sometimes a bed is made sothat each separate delicate hair standsuprights thus giving the entire nest theappearance of a little brush of downyfur Then again the eggs are laidspirally round a tiny branch and asthe covering follows their course theeffect resembles the Bushy tail of afox only the nest is more beautifulthan the brush of the finest fox thatever roamed over country The building of this downy nest is the last earthly labor of the mother butterfly forby the time it is completed her owndelicate body is denuded of its naturalcDg and there is nothing left forher to do but to die a sacrifice whichshe and heroically makes inthe interest of the coming butterflygenerationSTILL RULES THE WAVESBritannia Owns Half the Tonnageof the World in Ships andUncle Sum Is NextThe old time boast

latter total10615S4 owned by the British coloniesthroughout the world the UnitedKingdom possesses no less than 12826924 tons It is indeed a far cry from thispredominating tonnage to the secondbiggest which it is hardly surprisingto learn is that of the United States ofAmerica and which figures oqt to 2465387 tonsGermany takes third place with 2453334 tons which thus follows closelyupon American

In the DrrkI am convinced of the truth of theeld theory that the pleasure of smoking resides more largely In the tastethan it does in the sight said a business man of this city who recentlyunderwent a minor operation for granulated eyelids I had to sit for threedays in total darkness and being aconfirmed smoker 1 longed for thesolace of a cigar The first difficulty Iencountered was in getting a light and1 wouldnt confess my helplessnessuntil I had burned off half my mustache Then I let my wife hold thematch but I kept complaining that thetobacco wouldnt ignite My wifewould assure me that it was burninglike a furnace but I couldnt taste athingOne of the main pleasures of thehabit although we dont realize it isto exhale the smoke gently xul watchit curl up into the air I caugTft myselfstraining after that sight a hundredtimes and there was an overwhelmingsense of something missing Exceptwhen I inhaled the smoke it was absolutely impossible to tell whether thecigar was going so I got some cigarettes and inhaled every one But itwas a poor substitute 1 felt instinctively that I was getting only a morselof the old delightWhen they took off the bandage Igrabbed my pipe with

peddlercontinued and again the lawyer protested I tell you 1 dont want anything Get out But the peddler persisted so that the lawyer thoroughlyangry quickly arose and threw the intruder down the stairsJust as he lauded the lawyers partner appeared and taking it for granted that there was good reason for suchaction he seized the poor man andthrew him down the next flightStrange enough the janitor of thebuilding saw the second landing of thepeddler and the fact that he was apeddler was enough to cause him toseize the victim and throw him downthe final flight of stairs Here the unfortunate man picked himself up andrubbing his bruises observed Wellthis is the first visit I have made tothis building and I must say tbey havegot a perfect system Detroit FreePressParegoric

and commenced to cleanit Pietro lay in the corner watchiugme He knew as well as I what myevery movement meantIt was a glorious morning The airwas filled with the perfume of yellowjasmine watted down from the tops ofthe tall trees No matter in what direction I looked wild flowers met my eyeIt was indeed an earthly paradise thatquiet little nook in the swamp Not asound disturbed the stillness of the scenesave now and then the splash of somefish or animal in the dark water overthereSitting down on the upturned root ofan ancient cypress tree I prepared torest awhile and enjoy the scene to myhearts content to live in paradise justfor onceI dont know how long I had been sitting there when hearing a rustling inthe tangled vines behind me I turnedmy head The picture that met my gazewill remain engraved upon my memorybo long as life lastsMy eyes were dazzled by the girls indescribable beauty 1 turned them awayas I would from the sun then lookedagainThou seemest surprised young stranger Verily I do bethink me thou takestme for a spirit Thou art tall and strongyoung man Surely a bit of a girl hasnot frightened thee out of thy witsNo fair creature I repiled I amnot overcome from fright so much as bysurpriseLook thee stranger is not this trulya lovely kingdom and as such should itnot have a ruler That being true whyshould not I be its queen 2 My home isjust two miles away

blossoms of thewood to the rarest specimens of theworld I could see at a glance why theplace was called Jasmine Bower for inevery direction that fragrant flower couldbe seenLaurine ushered me into a beautifulroom Here and there soft seated setteeswere temptingly arranged and vases tilledwith flowers stood on a table near a window Everything about the room fromthe paintings on the wall to the well filled bookcase betokened refinement andtastePresently she returned and placed before me cake and wine aud bade me partakeJust at this juncture I heard hearysteps in an adjoining room In a momenttbe door opened and in stepped two asfine specimens of manhood as ever metmy gaze Each was more than sis feettall and as strong as an oxThese are my brothers said Laurineintroducing us I told this gentlemanwhom 1 met in the swamp that youwere mighty hunters and would showhim where to hunt and fishMany were the hunts we had togetherIn the depths of the dark wild swampand many were the quiet smokes we enjoyed at night in my little cabinScarcely a day passed that I did not goto the Bower and on each succeedingvisit my love for Laurine grew stronger1 could think or dream of nothing elsesave

expecting to findLaurine there Picking up a book I hadjust begun to read when my attentionwas attracted by the rustling of skirts inthe hallway outside the door Just as Iarose- Laurine entered the
