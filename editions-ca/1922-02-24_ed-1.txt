HarrisonBurk, Sam Minor and Wm. Roe werefined $9.50 eachfor failing to securethe necessary dog license and tagsfor -their canines. In answering thei1 charges in Court the parties gave. many varied excuses. One coloredjman said he did not have enoughI money to buy something to eat, andtherefore was unable to purchase a' license." It developed that he was the! owner of four dogs, .,for three ofwhich he had already secured licenses.I At the trials only one dog was named"Ring," while six others bore the"Teddy."Mr. and Mrs. John B Geis, residingin the flat in the Wilson building, atthe corner of Main and Third streets,were awakened at a late hour Tuesday night by a noise in the K. of P.lodge room, on the floor above them.Thinking burglars were at work inthe building Mr. Geis summoned police, who, after a thorough search ofthe building, came 'to .the conclusionthat the burglars were mostly conspicuous by their absence.When Mr. and Mrs. J.

THE NEWS:The more I see of "the movies"the more impressed I am with theirwonderful educational value, andwith the fact that this educationalvalue, unavailed as it "is to any greatextent, as yet, far more than counterbalances any damage that may bedone to mind or morals by the occasional tendency to something sensational, which tendency, it may be observed, is becoming more and morerare.Think of what the movies havemeant to that considerable part ofevery American community which,burdened with the struggle for existence, leads the narrowest of lives,reads little, and has had no conception of how the other half lives.Thousands of people who, before themovies came, had never seen a cathedral or the inside of a fine home,or a fashionable woman attired insilks and jewels, who never, in fact,.saw much of anything, can now, inimagination, roam through palaces,climb mountains, gaze upon the mostwonderful scenes of nature, hobnobwith the great, and revel in an entirely new world.Small wonder, then, that themovies are so nobular. And 1ipvhave as yet barely scratched the surface of the vast educational fieldslying before them. I have visitedthe Paris Grand many times, andhave come away impressed with thefact that some of the films shownther are of undoubted educationalvalue, as they showed me sceneswhich I am ( entirely unfamiliar.Some of the "news pictures," for instance, have changed my conceptionof how the big cities and some of theoutside country looks. All in all, themovies are to be commended for mostthings and only to be condemned invery slight degree for things thatare rapidly being eliminated.A MOVIE FAN.CHIROPRACTOR BILL IS PASSED' IN HOUSEBy the narrow margin of 44 to 42the House of Representatives Tuesday afternoon passed the Chiropractor Bill, providing for a special boardof examiners for nractitionprs ntthat profession, taking them fromunder the jurisdiction of the StateBoard of Health.The board, which opposed the bill.will carry the fight to the Senate,where it hopes to defeat it Dr. J. N.McCormick spoke against it beforethe House, and Dr. R. G. Dunn aLouisville chiropractor, advocated it.Representative H. C. Duffy ofHarrison county, introduced the billand spoke for it, while the floorfight against it was led with vigoroy Representative R. O. Huntsman,or Alien county, a Republican.Opponents of the bill introducedfifteen amendments, most of whichmentioned other branches of thehealing sciences, such as osteopathy,and provided boards of examinersfor them."This amendment is meant to killthe bill," said Mr. Duffy each time,and they were voted down.TBE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS, KENTUCKY'"- t-4FADED TINEach package of "Diamond Dyes"contains directions so simple anywoman can dye or tint her worn,shabby dresses, skirts, waists, coats,stockings, sweaters, coverings, draperies, hangings, everything, even ifshe has never dyed 'before.

In the full light of. eternitywe shall discover how greatly we areindebted to them. They aid us inour fight against principalities andpowers in high places of which Paulspeaks. They are spiritual beingsand their ministry is spiritual andprovidential. Compare this with thegross, so-called spiritualism of former days and now revived by SirOliver Lodge, Conan Doyle, and others. It is a challenge to the churchthat the revival of spiritualism arrived before the reviyal of spiritualreligion.Heaven is the future dwellingplace of the righteous. It is called:Their rest; The Heavenly country;The prepared Kingdom r A garner;The Father's house; Paradise; TheHoly City. Whatsis Heaven like?It is both a place and a state.Heaven is a place. I don't meanearth, stone, corner lots, buildingsand houses. What is a place? Weaffirm of it that you are eitherthere or you are not there, so Heavenis a place separate from sin andsinners. It is said by John to haveno sea, no night, no shut gates, notemple. There "is poetry, of course,in these figures, but they convey thetruth of light, fellowship, society,activity, unhampered and unhindered. It is a perfect sphere, perfectlysuited to the perfect state of being.Heaven is a state. There is life,glory, blessedness and security. Thewords life and eternal life describeit. There is the river of life, andthere is no death there. A state ofglory; Glory from the face of God;Glory from the cross; Glory from theresurrection and the ascension;Glory from earthly experience, inthe fires of affliction; Glory sublime,immortal, unearthly, with bodies asbeautiful as love and as strong astruth, holding spirits that shine likethe attributes of God. There willalso be the blessedness of fellowshipand service. There will be no sorrow, no tears and no crying.I argue that there will be recognition in Heaven from the very conception, of Heaven itself. It is notpantheistic Heaven. It is not an absorption of created intelligence backinto the diety. We go into heavenas individuals. Our very-Tiames arewritten in the Lamb's Book of LifeWe carry with us our intelligenceand our exalted moral natures. Wewill know not less, but vastly morethan we know down here. I add tothis argument the promise, "Weshall be satisfied," and I don't believe our satisfaction would be complete without -Heavenly recognition.There will be activity in -Heaven.Bodily activity without fatigue.mental activity witnout error orconfusion, and the soul withoutsin.We will have eternal security inHeaven. There will be no tempterand no temptation. No probation,but continued progress in knowledge, love, and Heavenly gloryHave you made sure that you aregoing to Heaven?

B. 104),which defines newspapers and jobprinting establishments in Kentuckythe same way they are regarded bythe Federal law, as manufacturingplants, passed the Senate '33 to 1.Senator Pal Garner, of Breckinridgecounty, was the only opponent of themeasure. Senators Reynolds, Hubbard, Baker and Auxier were absent.When the rules committee calledup Senator Bell's bill in the Senate,the author spoke on the need for themeasure. He read' from income taxrulings to show how the business isdefined by the Federal government.Senator Gardner spoke in opposition to the bill.Senator Daugherty said that anewspaper and job printing establishment is a manufacturing plant,and should be sov defined. SenatorHarris inquired if newspapers do notprint and bind books, in many cases.Mr. Daugherty replied "yes," andsaid that there are many countyseats in Kentucky without anynewspaper. He said that the countryeditor is in close touch with the people, and "is an upbuilder of hiscommunity. He chides us for ourerrors, and when we are deservinghe makes a note of it. -Under manydiscouragements, he plies a callingof great value to the country side."Senator H. F. Green said thatmany newspapers also bind books,abstracts, etc., and that in this, aswell as their function of publishers,they are manufacturers. "I also callyour attention," he added, "to theeducational feature involved. Manycounties now have but one littleprinting press. It is struggling forexistence. Many have died of thehard times. Paper and labor costsare so high, as well as machinery,that some have had to quit the business. When that happens, it is astroke at the educational facilitiesof that community.

SenatorCaywood objected, saying that suchan amendment would kill the bill.Senator Davis supported Mr. Perry'samendment.Senator Brock opposed theamendment, saying that after objectionable features had been removedin other States, they could be reinserted before being shown in Kentucky. Senator Davis said that movingpictures should be censored at thesource, and not in each State. Hesaid that it would be physically impossible for the three individuals onthe Kentucky board to see everyfilm before it was shown. SenatorHall spoke for the bill. Mr. Perry'samendment was overwhelmingly defeated. vADDING MACHINE BOLLS CHEAPWe have in stock for the convenience of users of adding machines, abig stock of paper rolls.
