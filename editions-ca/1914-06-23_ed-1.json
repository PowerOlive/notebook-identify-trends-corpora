Mrs. Belle Vimont Armstrong,
aged about 60, died early Saturday
morning at St. Vincents Hospital, In
dianapolis, as the result of a second
operation. Mrs. Armstrong has been
in failing health for several months.
Early in April she underwent a seri
ous operation from which she received
no good results. About a week ago
it was decided by her physicians that
another operation was necessary.
This was performed, and conditions
were found to be more serious than in
the first operation. She did not rally
from the shock of the second, and
continued to grow worse until the end
came. Mrs. Armstrong was the daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Vimont, of
this place, and the greater part of her
life has been spent here. She was
one of nine children, and is survived
by two brothers T. A. Vimont, of
Paris, and Banks Vimont, of Lexing
ton; four sisters, Mesdames Brady, of
Carlisle, Harrison, of Lexington,
Myers, of Bowling Green, and Bean,
of Nashvillle, Tenn. She was united
when a young woman in marriage to
Mr. Robert Armstrong, and their mar
riage was blessed with one daughter,
Miss Mary Armstrong, who survives
her mother, Mr. Armstrong having
died several years ago. Mrs. Arm
strong was one of our most popular
f ladies, and was loved by all who knew
her. She was a member of the Meth
odist Church, and a devoted mother.
Some years ago Miss Mary Armstrong"
secured a position as instructor in mu
sic at Hamilton College, Lexington,
her mother going with her at the
time. Mrs. Armstrong and daughter
have passed since then considerable
time at Lexington. Where the daugh
ter secured a position the mother was
always with her. The devotion be
tween mother and daughter was in
deed remarkable, and has been com
mented upon by friends. About two
years ago Miss Armstrong secured a
position in Indianapolis, Ind., where
they have since resided. The remains,
accompanied by Miss Armstrong, and
other relatives, arrived here Sunday
at noon, and were taken to the vault,
where they were laid until 10:30 a. m.
Monday. After a short funeral ser
vice at the grave by Rev. J. D. Redd
and Dr. C. C. Fisher, they were laid
to rest in the Millersburg cemetery.
One of the prettiest, as well as
the most elaborate, receptions of the
season was that given by Mrs. W. V.
Huffman, Thursday piternoon from
3 to 6, at her home on Main street.
One hundred and seventy-five invita
tions had been issued and 154 re
sponded to. The afternoon was beau
tiful and comfortable. The -guests
wer received at the front door by
Mrs. O. E. Hurst, and deposited their
cards with ltttle Miss Lillian Day, of
Paris, niece of the hostess, who was
in charge of the silver card tray.
They were then conducted into the
presence of the receiving line, which
occupied a position in the drawing
room, by Mrs. J. D. Booth. The line
was made up of Mrs. W. V. Huffman,
hostes, Mrs. J. B. Day, of Paris, sister
of the hostess, Mesdames K. R. and
A. M. Vaught, of Indianapolis, Ind.
The entertainers in the parlor were
Mrs. M. C Grimes and Mrs. S. C. Bas
com. From thence they were con
ducted to the library, where they
were met by Mesdames John Marr,
Anna Jefferson, G. W. Judy and J. T.
Judy. In here frappe was served and
was presided over by Miss Alma
Hurst, of Lexington, assisted by
Misses Elizabeth Ingles, Alice Ingles
and Aleta Wilson. They were then
ushered from the drawing room to the
dining room by Mesdames Claude Vi
mont and J. H. Grimes, which was
presided over by Mesdames R. L. Wil
son and T. D. Judy, where ice cream
frozen in calla lillies and roses were
served anti cakes with the letter "H"
on them. The color scheme for the
occasion was pink and white and was
nicely carried out in everything. The
dining room was darkened and softly
illuminated with wax tapers, pink "and
white carnations being used. As the
guests passed from the dining room
the favors, which were carnations,
were pinned on them "by Misses Ame
lia Hurst and Verona McKenney, the
latter of Mississippi Soft sweet mu
sic on the victrola, which was sta
tioned in the upper hall, and operated
by Mr. Richard Huffman, was dispens
ed during the entire time. This was
as occasion that was enjoyed by all
present and will long be remembered.
In the evening Dr. and Mrs. W. V.
Huffman entertained about 18 of the
young people in honor of their son,
Richard Huffman, and cousin, Miss
McKenney, the latter of Missouri.
Rook was indulged in during the
greater part of ilie evening. Ices and
cakes were served.

Not in years has there been in
lOwensboro and Daviess County such
' a general expression in favor of any

The Stanley men realize that they
are hopelessly beaten in Davtess and
even the Henderson man's strongest
supporters are unable to muster the
courage to predict' a victory for him
in Daviess County, while the strength
of McCreary amounts to nothing.

CROWD AT GREENSBURG.
Gov. Beckham spoke to a court
house full to overflowing at Greens
burg, last Thursday. Mr. Beckham
was met at the train, and escorted
to the court house, while the Greens
burg brass band furnished music.
Ex-State Senator S. T. Gorin presided
at the meeting, and Attorney R. L.
Durham introduced the speaker. Gov.
Beckham's speech was along the line
of his former speeches over the State,
and to the satisfaction of his hearers,
he refuted the charges made against
him by Mr. Stanley in his speech.
Mr. Beckham reviewed the legisla
tion passed while he occupied the
Governor's chair, and recited the
many reform measures and the devel
opment of the State's finances during
his administration. Gov. Beckham
has always been strong in county, and
his friends claim for him a more
united support than he has ever had
in Green.
It is conservatively estimated that
he will get three-fourths of the vote
cast.

A WINNING FIGHT.
LOUISVILLE, KY.f June 22 Con
templating with a mournful air the
irresistible Beckham wave that is
sweeping Louisville, a lone Louisville
supporter of Gov McCreary opines
that Mr. Beckham must be losing
ground in the country districts be
cause his friends are making such ef
forts In his behalf in Louisville.
There is nothing in this. Mr. Beck
ham is stronger in the country dis
tricts than was the case two weeks
ago stronger, if for no other reason,
because of the collapse of the opposi
tion. A well informed looker on in
Kentucky politics stated that Mr.
Beckham will carry 110 out of the 120
counties in the State. This may be
disputed, "but there is no reason to
doubt that Mr. Beckham will carry
three counties out of four and brob
ably ten out of eleven Congressional
districts.

(Continued from Page 1.)
NOTES OF THE GAME.
The team got off to a bad start in
letting Huntington trim them twice
in slugging matches, but it is hoped
that they will revenge themslves on
Lexington and' brace up while on their
six-days' road trip. "Red" Munson,
the new manager, has begun cleaning
out some of the old material. Red
Hart and Chic Long, pitchers, were
released, as it is believed they were
not putting forth their best efforts.
Munson has his lines out for two
college stars. Applegate expects to
get back in the lineup within a few
days. The Paris team has some fine
material in Daubert, shortstop, Hobbs,
second base, Shafer, outfielder, Fran
cisco, catcher, Alten, Hannah and
Utrecht, pitchers, and Manager Mun
son assures the Paris fans that he will
fill in the other positions and show
Bourbon county some real baseball.
