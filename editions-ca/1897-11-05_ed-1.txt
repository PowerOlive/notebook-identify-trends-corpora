enormous plaralties havebeen swept away and a reverse plurality of 58159 is given for Parker The greatest surprises of the returns are tho great gainsmade in the assembly by the democratsmany of them being in countiesand districts where there was no expectation on the part of democratic managers qfwinning Republicans explain these gains byattributing them to the heated municipal campaigns and the

regulation of the Indian tribesunder the law governing the Dawescommission has called out two notableexpressions as- to the future of the redman from Indians who are in everyway competent to speak for the raceThe general reader in view of the gradual but steady elimination of the -Indiansfrom the American populationand the consequent simplification ofthe Indian problem may be surprisedto learn that there are educated Indians who look to the absorption oftheir race as the final solution of the9Indian problemIn a speech delivered near Muscogeein the Indian territory recently HonWylie Mcintosh a full blooded Creekand a member of the house of warriorsof his tribe uttered the following lamentationNo more will be heard the whizzingof the leathered arrow met in itsflight by the bullet from the whitemans rifle The war song is hushed foreternity and the smoke of the councilfire hovers no longer over the childrenof the forest These are goneThe white man now goes unarmedamong the remnants of phis once terrible foe seeking everywhere to planthis vine and fig tree and rear a civilized home Outside of the five civilizedtribes of Indians there is no resistanceoffered to his taking possession and heonly waits for the peaceful signal ofhis own government to enter and possessWe know how a man feels when hefirst awakes to the consciousness thata new race a new nation of which heis a part is born because we have feltit but who can- know and feel the agony of a man -who stands at the graveside of a race of a nation of which lieis a part and delivers its funeral oration Mr Mcintosh summed up thephilosophy of the situation as followsThe fact maybe a sad one but itis nevertheless a fact that there is nolonger a place on the soil of the unionfor an Indian as an Indian The pathosof his situation should and does appeal to all great men but the logic offate is not moved iby the prayers of afallen race nor their destiny averted bya tear for their endIn a recent issue of the Forum SimonPokagon a very intelligent Pottawatomie Indian discusses with much fullness of information The Future of theRed Man His conclusion that the redman has about reached the end xi histether is the same as that of Mr Mcintosh but -while the latter believesin the annihilation of the remnants ofhis race Mr Pokagon believes thsttheremnant will be absorbed by the dominant and conquering raceMr Pokagon gives a historic reviewof the relations of the white and the redman He stoutlj maintains that the redman was not originally the fierce andrelentless savage that he grew to bethat he was kind and helpful to thefirst Europeans who visited the continent but that his gentle and friendlynature was changed by the treacherjcruelty and avarice of the Europeanadventurers It is a very interestingsuggestion and some future historianof the Ted race anxious that it maybe justified for its long and courageousif disastrous conflict with the whiterace will trace those earlier relationsof the two peoples out of which grewthe policy of vindictive conquest 6ntheone hand and heroic resistance on theother In- the final paragraphs of hisarticle after doing what he could to defend the course pursued hy his race MrPokagon reached tb following conclusion which is best stated in his ownpeculiarwayI am frequently asked Pokagondo you believe that the white man andthe red man were originally of oneblood My reply has been I do notknow but from the present outlookthey surely will be The index fingerof the past and present is pointing tothe future showing most conclusivelythat by the middle of the next century all Indian reservations and tribalrelations will have passed away Thenour people will begin to scatter andthe result will be a general mixing upof the races Through intermarriagethe blood of our people like the watersthat flow into the great ocean willbeforever lost in the dominant race rindgenerations yet unborn will read thehistory of the red men of the forestand inquire Where arc theyNothing could be more pathetic thanthe opinions here quotsd of Hon WylieMcintosh and Simon Pokagon on theextinction of their rage snd the xrobable future of the small remnant ofit that survives According to the census of 1S90 the entire Indian population numbers only 249273 souls andwhere they once had the whole country as a happy hunting ground fromocean to ocean and from the northernto the southern- lakes they are nowconfined to 212000 square miles of reservations Comprised in the five tribesof the Cherokee nation are GG289t 14224 of whom are classed as coloredpeople New

ABOUT CIGARSInformation as to Size andGiven Try the NameShapeI am often astonished and sometimes amused at the ignorance displayed by the average smoker in regardto the meaning of the various namesapplied to cigars said a large dealerto a Star reporter For instance Ifrequently hear men laud Perfectos tothe skies as though the word perfectoswere a name signifying quality Onlythe other day a customer told me thata Perfecto which I had sold him wasnot genuine because it was-altogether-differentin flavor from one he boughtof me a week or two ago How absurd such a statement was will be plainto you if you understand the real signification-of cigar namesThe word perfectos is used in thetrade to designate the peculiar shapeof such cigars Workmen get morefor making them than for formingothers as it requires a skillful handto roll the material into the perfectoshape For this reason a perfectonecessarily costs more to manufacturethan a cigar of the same tobacco butless difficult to make But as far as theword goes it is used in trade only torindicate -the shape of the cigar which- -is fairly long big bellied and usuallydark in color iBesides words used to designate theshape we have words which refer tosize Such wqrds as finas grandes Ofthe terms applied to shapes I may citeTrabucos Londres Conchas Eeina Victorias Regalias these words being -pluralsThe language you see isSpanish and the names were first applied -by the Cubans Words which indicate size and shape are Infantes andCqquitas applied to tiny cigars Princesses and Elegantes Figaro is a shapwbetween Coquita and Concha Invincible is perhaps the largest cigar of allthough perfectos are made that have asmuch tobacco in them as the InvincibleThe panatella is about two thirds aslong as an ordinary lead pencil withalmost the same diameter throughoutCombinations of size and shape are indicated by such names as ConchasFinas Conchas Specials LondresGrandes so that in two words you havothe shape and size of thecigarIn choosing cigars the majority ofsmokers know very little about anyparticular brand beyond the one thejare in the habit of smoking This selection is usually made from experience Outside of this the choice ispurely haphazard and by the looks ofthe cigar limited price Half thetime a dealer offers such a customerwhat experience has taught him hispatron will like For instance a mancomes into my store and looks helplessly in a showcase saying I wanta medium cigar imported about twofor a quarter or 15 cents straight Hemay add fresh or seasoned but heusually takes what is offered himThis indecision enables the unscrupulous dealer to sell such a customer a cigar costing half a cent or acent less than another cigar which isretailed at the same price There i ereally but about 20 brands of importedcigars in demand and half as manydomestic The long glass cases full ofopen boxes which one sees in big cigarstores are for show The cigars commonly called for are displayedin a four foot case Consequently thecounters and cases running dowu theentire length of some cigar stores onlyserve to confuse the purchaser Thecigars in such a display areetitions Stands of course differ according to the nature of the averajrecustomer but a case that will hold halfa dozen- brands will reasonably coverthe demand of any retailer Washington StarA Snri IndicationThose people

kaitor and OwnMONARCH OF ENGLANDAustrian Arclideaconcas Is tlie Legitixuate SovereignIn France and in Spain the legitimistis taken seriously In England according to the man in the street andiaccording to others in other places thelegitimist is simply an idiot who is notworth further consideration Yetamong English legitimists are manymen of whose sanity there can be noquestion whose integrity is beyond dispute and whose loyalty to Queen Victoria is unimpeachableIn the first place perhaps it maybe suggested that the use of the wordJacobite in connection with legitimism in this country is not very happyIt is employed because of the historicalassociations which appeal so stronglyto the English as a nation But it doesnet necessarily imply as is too com- jmonly supposed that the legitimists inthis country aim solely at the restoration of the house of Stuart But forthe peculiar local associations of theterm Jacobite the legitimist in Eng-land might with more propriety stylehimself a Carlist and thereby identifyhimself more closely with his brotherin Prance or Spain The point whichin fairness ought not to be lost sight ofis that the Jacobite is simply an Englishman who professes the faith oflegitimism a member it may be otherwise expressed of the English branchof a catholic or universal partySocial systems may and do existwhere the monarchical principle is accepted but where the sovereign is elected Social systems may and do existwhere the principle of primogenitureIs accepted but where the monarchicalprinciple is rejected altogether But asocial system where the monarchicalprinciple and the principle of primogeniture are both accepted but wherethe sovereign is yet not the one entitled by the laws of primogeniture tooccupy the throne is an anomaly thejustification of -which must be soughtoutside logical reason Prom this aspect the legitimist appears more sanothan they who call him mad The lawof gavelkind and the law regulatingIhe succession to the throne are theonly two exceptions to the rule bywhich the eldest son succeeds his fatherand failing issue the succession isvested in the elder female line Questions of fact only are involved and fortunately these are plain enough ByIhe law of primogeniture the sovereignof these realms should be Mary theFourth and Third nee Mary TheresaHenrietta Dorothea archduchess ofand wife of hisroyal highness Prince Louis of Bavaria Of her genealogical right to thethrone as representative of the seniorfemale line of the royal house of Stuarti hemale line having become extinct onHhb death of the Cardinal King HenryIX there is no dispute The facts arestated every year in Whitakers Almanack for all who run to read TheHanoverian dynasty being derivedfrom a daughter of James I has noright to the throne until the whole issue of Charles I is exhausted whichis not yet the case Nineteenth CenturyIMITATION OYSTERS IN PARISA Perfect Counterfeit in Appearancelint tike Taste Is Far from GenuineThe most singular thing I saw whilein Paris said a gentleman who hasjust returned from Europe was artificial oysters I dont mean what arecalled mock oysters that is meat doneup in a patty or a potpie but the realbivalve intended to serve raw And asfar as looks go you would say at aglance that they were genuine American oysters but when you came to eatone the difference would be perceptibleat once How they are made and whatmaterials are used in their manufacture is a mystery which I did not solvebut it is certain that a great deal ofmoney is made by the producers Theusual price paid for these artificial oysters is three cents each or 30 cents adozen and sometimes in the secondclass restaurants they are to be hadfor two cents each though they are notapt to be very fresh at that price Youorder a plate on the half shell and whenthe waiter brings them to you they locJkas nice as the real oyster that you get Inthe best New York oyster house If youare not a good judge of oysters you willeat them with your wine and go awaywithout asking any questionsThe only really genuine thing aboutthem is the shells The manufacturersI was told buy second hand shells fromthe restaurant keepers at a small expense and with a harmless and tastelesspaste fasten the spurious oyster in itsplace Only one half a shell is used forthe purpose and in that shape the fraudoysters are packed in tiers in boxes andbaskets which are displayed in windows on counters or on shelves Others to be served without the shells areput ux in cans or In glass jars containing from 25 to 100 The imitations are consumed in such largequantities that the dealers in real oysters are urging the restaurant andhotel keepers to break tip their shells asfast as their contents are eaten andeven pay the cooks and waiters liberallyto pound them to pieces so that themakers of the artificial article will havea limited supply of shells Washington StarOur Easy LanguageJohnny do you know where thosepills arc that

had slept the previousnight but he found the door closed andlockedHearing the voices of the undertakerand his men in Strongs room he entered it The men looked up from thecoffin at him and Hodson the undertaker bowed and said good morning asWarrenton approached and looked atthe dead mans faceIve never seen anything like thatsmile colonel said Hodson and Ivebeen in this business over 20 years Itwas all I could do to get my men to goto work when they first saw him Wetried to close his eyes but the lids areas stiff as whaleboneThe colonel shuddered at the coarseness of the mans wordsHow do you explain the smile heaskedI cant explain it at all answeredthe undertaker I dont think such athing ever happened beforeWarrenton bent over the coffin fora moment It seems to me to be agenuine smile

replaced the chair when the portiere was drawn back and Hodsonlooked inI beg pardon colonel but CaptWelsh aked me to allow no one to comein here I thought you went into thehallI was just wondering how Whidbycould have slept so soundly unless hewas drugged said the colonel Iwould not have come in if I had thoughtit was forbidden Whidby and I are sointimate you know I feel as if I wereat home hereOh no harm done said the undertaker as he held the curtain aside forWairrenton to pass outThe colonel went into the hall and niturned into the parlor Here he lookedabout aimlessly for a moment and thenseeing an open door which led to theservants rooms in the rear he passedoutIn a little room adjoining the kitchenhe found MatthewsI want to see you Matthews saidthe colonel I want to ask you

street in extensive grounds It was in the suburbsof the city and at the end of one of theelectric car linesWhen the mayor went home thatafternoon about six oclock he foundThe next moment they heard her playing on herviolinhis family sitting on the front verandawaiting for his return The group consisted of his son Marion a young manjust of age his married daughterLilian her husband Fred Walters andMrs RoundtreeTalking about the murder I knowsaid the mayor as he came up thestepsWe are concerned about your offering that reward dear Mrs Roundtree replied If I had been downtown1 should have begged you not to do itThe murderer is evidently of unsoundmind and the reward may direct hisattention to you You know he saysMammas only nervous interruptedLilian She hasnt taiked of a thingall day except the isolation of our houseand how easy it would be for a creatureof that kind to make us his victimsPshaw thats all nonsense exclaimed the mayor taking the seat vacated for him by his son who hadthrown himself into a hammock Besides the reward may be the means ofputting the man under lock and keyI wish it had been the duty of someone else to offer it replied Mrs Roundtree plaintively Why dear he wasnear enough to have killed you when heput that note into your pocketHe is not that sort of criminal saidLilian to the surprise of the othersHe will never kill anyone in open daylight on the street where ho night beseen As the murderer says in his letters the secret lies in that smile on MrStrongs face Dr Kramer saw thebodj and he said this afternoon that hehad never heard of anj one being killedwith just such a facial expression Itis my opinion that youll have to godeep into psychical phenoroetta to getat the mysteryHush Lilian I dont like to hear youtalk that way said Mrs RoundtreeI have never approved of your readingthe books you readYou object to my reading anythingwhich is really new and progressivesaid the young wife pettishly Theworld would stand still if we did notstudy the new sciences if we did notallow ourselves to think on new linesIt seems to me sister remarkedMarion that you have talked moreabout the murder than anyone elseSince we have been out here I havenoticed that mother has changed thesubject three times but some remark ofyours has always brought the conversation back to itBrother you know that is a deliberate it is not true Lilian retortedangrilyI must say I thought so too dear interposed Fred Walters Dont you remember mother said something aboutthe services at church to night Wellbefore anyone had time to reply youbegan talking again about whether itcould be proved that Whidby had nbtbeen out of the house to distribute thenotesLilian seemed to forget her anger inher interest in the subject She roseand stood in the doorway As faras that is concerned she said withanimation Whidby could have had anaccomplice It was a strangely dramaticthing the way he called up the policeat the telephone and remained with thecorpse till they came not even allowingthe servant to enter If he is guiltj heis at least original In these days ofmasculine stupidity it wccZd a pityto execute an original man I nevercould see why murderers should be suchshort sighted fools I read the otherday of a man who shot another downand went to the jail pretending to beinsane to escape punishmenl Howmuch more effective would it have beenif he had systematically pretended tobe insane a month or so before he committed the deed I mean if he haddone little things which would scarcely cause remark at the time but whichcoupled -with the crime afterwardswould have pointed conclusively to insanity If I wanted to drown myself inthe river and did not want anyone tothink it was done intentionally Iwould first do a great many things tomake it look as if I had never dreamedof such a thing I would make engagements leave things unfinished as if1 intended to return to them the nextmoment andOh hush my child interruptedMrs Roundtree

suffered a stroke of paralysis which the physician said was brought on by excessive laborMy left limb was entirely helpless and myright limb was fast becoming so My physician became uneasy and after attendingupon me for a week or so he brought me aTiox of Dr Williams Pink Pills for PalePeople saying that he believed they woulddo me more good than anything which heknew of as he had used them with greatsuccess in a case very similar to mine whereall other remedies had failed The case inquestion was that of L Phillips of PetersvilleAbout the time I began taking the secondlox of these pills a decided change wasnoticed and when I had taken two moreboxes we discovered that I was actually getting well You can probably imagine whata relief and feeling of gladness this was tome after being confined to my bed forinearly two months Well I kept on taking the pills according to directions until Ihad consumed nine boxes of them whichcompletely cured meX am sound and well to day with not
