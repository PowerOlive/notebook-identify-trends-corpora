ifHAT A DOLLAR DID
A RlCI
CYNIC RECEIVES AN OBJECT
UESSON IN CHARITY
-He Saw Tor Himself How the Otkor
Half laves and Learned That All Who
Ask For Help Are Not Humbugs The
Experience Made a New Man of Him
Qne good woman who has devoted
amah of her time for several years to
the relief of distress among the very
poor people of this city succeeded in
opening the eyes and likewise the pock
etbook of a cynical rich man not many
days ago She solicited financial aid
from him and doubtless would have
met with a brusque rebuff had it not
been that her position in society com
manded polite consideration As it was
the rich man essayed to be patronizing
abd said My dear madam I know
that you try to do good among these
poor people but I can assure you that
to
ur efforts are tiracticallv wasted
ley take your money and such cloth-
jg and food as you can give them and
m chuckle over your gullibility
If I can induce a starving creature
chuckle I shall consider the time
aid money well spent replied the
wpman with a mild tinge of reproof
Oh well I suppose that you are
bound to keep on wasting your time
retorted the rich cynic After a brief
pause he continued If you will dem
onstrate to rue that you can actually re
lieve distress with a dollar I will give
it to you just as often as you can dem
onstrate its usefulness in that direc
tion
Will you come with me said the
woman thus challenged The rich man
assented and accompanied his philan
thropic caller to her coupe Both enter
ed the conveyance and were dr Lo
the neighborhood of Eleventh avenue
and Fiftieth street The coupe stopped
in front of an unsightly tenement In
silence the man followed his companion
up two or three flights of stairs and he
soon was standing in- a cheerless room
about 12 feet square The floor and the
walls were absolutely barren and there
were not more than four pieces of furni
ture in sight One was a -small stove
in which a scant fire was burning
A middle aged man lay helpless on a
cot and kneeling by him were a boy
and a girl so raggedly clad that their
white skin was visible through more
than one rent A few empty dishes and
cooking utensils lying on the floor near
the stove told their mute story of desti
tution
The pathetic eagerness with which
the three emaciated occupants of the
room turned their glances upon the vis
itors touched a long dormant chord of
the rich mans heart He involuntarily
thrust his fingers into his vest pocket
but his companion laying a restraining
hand upon his arm advanced to the
cot and in a delicate and sympathetic
manner questioned the sick man regard
ing himself and his children She ex-
plained that their needs had been called
to her attention only a few hours be
fore She soon ascertained that there
was urgent need of nourishment and
bidding her cynical friend to accompa
ny her she hastened to the nearest gro
cery Frorn long experience the good
woman knew just what to purchase for
temporary relief in- a case of this kind
and within a quarter of an hour a bulky
basket was borne up to the desolate
room by the grocers boy Speedily the
fire in the little stove began to throw
out comforting heat and by and by the
grateful odors of cooking were diffused
Then with the assurance of another
visit and more substantial aid the dis
pensers of good cheer left the poor f am
ily to their unexpected enjoyment
Bo you think that charity was well
bestowed asked the woman as the
coupe bore them swiftly away from the
tenement district
Yes indeed I do replied the man
Trith a suspicious tremor in his voice
Well there is a list of what I
bought together with the prices con
tinued the woman handing a bit of
paper to her companion He took it and
read

Without a word the rich man took a
dollar from his pocketbook and handed
it to the good woman The next day
ahe received from him a check for one
thousand times that amount New

THE CHECK SYSTEM
An English Visitor Tells the People About
the American Way
The American constitution has been
called a system of checks So in Ameri
can life When you want to travel you
give your baggage to the porter of your
hotel and he gives you a check in re
turn At the station you reclaim it
with the check and pass it in at a coun
ter and receive anotner cnecK as you
approach your destination another func
tionary comes along the train takes
your cheok and gives you another check
in its place He fishes out your baggage
and conveys it to your hotel for a con
sideration You have left your third
and last check at the office of the hotel
when you enter it and thence it is de
livered up on receipt of the baggage
At first you bless this arrangement as
the salvation of the traveler After a
few weeks of it the tyranny of the check
becomes so galling that you begin to
long for the fine old English method of
dumping down your goods in front of a
porter and leaving them to find the way
themselves You would even hail it as
a personal triumph if some of your bag
gage would get lost But it never does
Sometimes it arrives late but it always
arrives
Yet it seldom arrives in the shape in
which it started if that is any consola
tion They who have to do with bag
gage see to that You very soon discover
why Americans carry their goods in
ironclad trunks and why it is madness
for anybody to do anything else I
started out like an idiot with a new
leather portmanteau They ripped the
stout brass lock off the first week
not for plunder apparently but simply
because it is the tradition of tho service
They punched it and kicked and danced
on it In softer hours when literary
inspiration came they wrote on it My
portmanteau today is an epitome of the
political sentiment of the United States
from New York to San Francisco As
a historical document it is beyond
price and I am contemplating the gift
of it to the library of congress at Wash
ington As a portmanteau it has both
feet in the grave
The system of checks is not confined
to travelers luggage The conductor of
the train passes carelessly to and fro
asking for your ticket and giing you a
check in return or asking for your
check and returning your tioket If j ou
hand your stick to a boy in a hotel
while you write your name in the reg
ister he dashes off to stow it away in
some secret place and returns triumphant
with a check In the very hotel bar
when you buy sevenpence haporth of
whisky you get a check and walk two
yards across the bar to pay at a desk
But the apotheosis of the check is at
Niagara When you go down to the
Cave of the Winds you strip off all
your clothes and leave them as well as
your valuables in a tin box with the
attendant Then you go down to battle
with the cataract attired only in a suic
of pyjamas a suit of oilskins and a
check lashed around your neck and ris
ing and falling with the beating of
your heart No wonder the American
speaks of death as handing in his
checks It is only by death that he can
rid himself of them London Mail
A Wonderful Avenue
Magnolia avenue which has been the
pride of Riverside from its founding
and which has won a national reputa
tion as a boulevard has had two de
fects The streets leading to it were
usually dusty and disagreeable while
the darkness of the avenue owing to the
dense foliage of the overhanging pepper
trees made it a rather dismal evening
drive All that is at an end It is now
possible to drive from the heart of town
over macadamized streets perfectly free
from dust and mud direct to the peer
less Magnolia avenue and if the drive
be taken in the ovening arc lights are
encountered every 800 feet giving
splendid illumination When the ave
nue is reached there is presented such
a sight as few if any towns possess
The electric poles are but 124 feet apart
and from these brackets project about
three feet From each bracket hangs a
cluster of three incandescent lights cov
ered with a reflector which throws the
light on to the driveway
As one stands at one end of this row
of lights but four or five of them can be
distinguished as individual lights the
remainder forming a continuous chain
of -fire which seemingly stretches away
for untold miles beneath the verdant
canopy of the arching pepper trees
Modern as is the scene it impresses the
beholder as an oriental fantasy worthy
of the Spanish Moors The imagined
extent of the wondrous chain of fire
however is in a degree an optical illu
sion Instead of being miles in length
it is but a little over a mile Instead of
there being unrold thousands of lights
one is amazed to learn that there are
but 150 suspended from but 50 poles

WHY IT WAS HOT
The Hash Epicures Initial Experience
With a Chafing Dish
I had heard of chafing dishes for
years said Smiley Williams but the
one I saw for the first time floored mel
completely
I never thought lnnch about the
blamed things but somehow I supposed
a chafing dish was some sort of concern
that they grated things in something
that rubbed together auJ mashed things
The other night though Bolton
and I went into a Madison street res
taurant for dinner You know I always
have a sneakingliking for hash of any
kind and so does Bolton Bolton order
ed turkey hash for two and the waiter
brought it on in a swell sort of silver
dish nearly as tall as a cake basket It
had a tight cover and when we opened
it it steamed like a 40 horsepower boil
er blowing off
I loaded up Boltons plate and in
the first pass at it he took the skin off
his tongue it was so hot
Just like these infernal places
Bolton growled Anything youve got
to eat is blistering hot while coffee is
always stone cold
After awhile Bolton took some more
hash and burned his tongue again
Holy Moses he said whats got
into that hash
I told him nobody was expected to
know anything about restaurant hash
especially the fellow who was eating it
but he wasnt satisfied
Well we kept on eating hash until
we had enough And do you know that
hash left in the dish was hotter than it
was at the start
Well said Bolton I wouldnt
have believed my eyes but with most
of the skin off my tongue Ive got to
give it up Then he called the waiter
Say he said in a low tone Ill
give you a quarter if youll tell me
what in blazes is the matter with that
hash
K
tt

What keeps that hash so all fired
hot
Why sah thats a chafing dish

Thats how I found out that a chaf
ing dish is a silver fruit stand with a
fire built under it Chicago Record
SPEAKING TO THE DEAF
A Mistake Is Often Made In Trying to
Enunciate Very Plainly
Many people and I am sorry to say
some teachers of the deaf fail to realize
in practice at least that speech is not
as clearly visible to the eyeasitjis audi
ble to the ear and think that by speak
ing slowly word by word and opening
their mouths to the widest extent they
will render the task of the speech reader
easier As a matter of faot they render
it all the more difficult- A child in
school may learn to understand a teach
er who mouths his words in this man
ner but this ability is of no value to
him when he leaves school Indeed per
fectly natural deliberate speech ij easier
to understand than the exaggerated
form of articulation which people are
apt to use the moment they know they
are talking to a totally deaf person
People who depend entirely -upon
their speech reading for understanding
others have requested me when intro
ducing them to strangers not to say
that they were deaf because they find
it easier to read the lips when the per
son speaking is not aware that he is Be
ing understood in that way I have in
my acquaintance a young man educated
wholly by this method who travels a
great deal and pioks up acquaintances
on the steamer or on the train just as
people do who possess all their faculties
I have in mind also a congenitally
deaf girl of 14 who is not considered
unusually bright yet whose speech is
clearly intelligible to strangers after
the first ten minutes who is intelligent
on the topics of the day and whose
larger and more conversational reper
tory is much larger and more entertain
ing than that of many young ladies of
20 and over that I have met in metro
politan society John Dutton Wright

The Captain Told Him
An Englishman touring through
America went on board a steamer late
one night and on the following morning
after walking on deck and looking
around him he stepped up to the cap
tain and asked I beg your pardon but
would you kindly tell me what lake
Im on
The Lake Huron replied the cap
tain and turned away
The Englishman looked puzzled for a
moment and then following the cap
tain began again I beg your pardon
you said
Its the Lake Huron roared the
captain thinking the man was deaf
Yes I know persisted the passen
ger but whats the name of the lake
that Im on
The Lake Huron shouted the cap
tain incensed at what he thought gross
stupidity and he turned away to relieve
himself by railing at one of the hands
The Englishman looked more puzzled
than ever
The lake youre on is the lake youre
on Of course it is The lake Im on
I cant help being the lake Im on What
impertinence 1 Let me look in my guide
book Perhaps that will tell me
It did tell him and then the humor
of the situation suddenly dawned upon
him London Tit Bits
