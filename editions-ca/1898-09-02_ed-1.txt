Staud StillBIt la the Opinion That Miles is Determinedto Make an Issue of the Conduct ofthe War and to Fix His OwnStatus in the MatterWashington Aug 31 The opinionis becoming general that a court-martialwill be ordered by the presidentfor Gen Miles provided the latter admits that he made the statementscredited to him in a recent interviewpublished in the Kansas City StarThe matter has simply been aggravated by the additional dispatch sentto his paper by the same correspondent Monday night It is certain thatGen Miles will be asked to tell thewar department whether or not heauthorized the statements credited tchimIt is inevitable that a court martialor a court of inquiry should follow immediately the possible admission ofGen Miles that he gave the interviewas it was publishedIf Gen Corbin and Secretary Aljreragainst whom the charges are madeshould ask for an investigation theresult would be a court of inquiry todetermine the truth of Gen Milesstatements If they should not dothis a court martial would be ordered to try Gen Miles on the chargeof conduct unbecoming an officer anda gentleman There is a feeling inand about the war department thatGen Corbin can not afford to challenge the statements said to havebeen made by Gen Miles and it is justas certain that he can not allow themto remain unchallenged and still preserve his good standing as an officerThe charge was almost openly madeTuesday by one officer in the war department that an order of the assistant secretary of war was recentlysuppressed by the adjutant generalsofficeOn the following day according tothis authority an order was promulgated b the adjutant general directlyopposite in meaning to that of the order sent to the assistant secretary forpromulgationWhen Gen Corbin was called to account in the matter he declared that hehad not seen the asistant secretarysorderNo doubt is entertained in officialcircles that the interview attributedto Gen Miles and the publicationTuesday morning of various orders tosubstantiate tha statements made inthe alleged interview foreshadow anopen controversy between the generalcommanding the army on one handand the secretary of war andJ3enCorbin on the other The prevailingopinion is that Gen Miles has come toa deliberate determination to make anissue of the conduct of the war to fixhis own status and to locate

wasperpetually at war She was lively howas grim She was a sentimentalist hedetested sentiment She was devoted tosociety to gossiplife He lived formost savage moroseness poured scorn onthe round of at homes and sesfchetio mtea parties Both were selfish and irelsome We may judge therefore thatSchopenhauer took his notions of women partly from his mother It goes without saying that these notions were violent in the extreme yet not withoutouiijd uupcia ui uuiu tThe new woman would rave at thissatire on her pretensions and yet itwould do her good to read what Schopenhauer has to say with as much

Public ElevatorI say old chap now dont be sodummy ps to take your hat off againjust because a woman comes into anelevatorThe traveler had gathered in hiscompanion by the two lapels of hiscoat and was laying- down the law tohim in dead earnest They had justemerged from one of the Stock Exchange elevators out of which hadstepped behind them one woman wearing a standard gauge hat and a dozenmen with their narrower headgear inliandWhy I thought it was the properthing Jack to hold your hat in yourhand when the gentler sex came intothe elevator with youXot at all an old fashioned fadgone into the lumber room Mightjust as well take vour hat off in streetcars or a railroad car The rule isno hats off on any movable platformor part thereof not especially reserved for the entertainment of wornenWell Ill be smashed thats a newone on me Jack-Lots of good things are unknownand new to 3rou and to many others Itmakes me fairty sizzle though I suppose every fellow has the right to doas he pleases with his chapeau to seeso manv men -who dont know the differencc between a dessert knife and atuning fork grab their hats off theirheads the moment a woman steps intoan elevator Watch sharp and you willalways observe these fellows eyingeach other as if in distrust or seekingapprobation Its all wrong infernalnonsense downright toadyism to thesex and expected by no woman ofcommon sense much less by one ac-customed to the ways of the properworldThis is all news to me Jack Illhave to key the boys up to it for mostof them would take their hats off ifthey met a woman in a freight elevatorThe more to Iheir credit for therea woman might be in distress It simply amounts to this An- elevator in ahotel or public structure is for thepublic convenience like a stairway ora street car or aiij other old thing otthat sort It is not a closed room Itis a movable platform Now it is notan invention of public convenience tobe required to uncover your bald headto a draft in an elevator

hesitating disapprovalthat divided the sentiment rather thanthe judgment of the order classestoward the Pittsburgh strikes had amisleading effect in the Coeur dAleneThe demagogues who here representedthe power of the miners unions werenot comparative thinkers they did notallow for the difference in the two situations They beheld merely the factof this doubtful verdict of the classesthat are seldom in doubt which side totake in struggles of this nature andthey were enormously uplifted by itMany of these men to judge them bytheir acts should be called anarchistsrather than union men If not self-devotedto the principle of destructionthey devoted their fellow laborer to bethe victim of that principle wheneverhis sole proletarianism differed fromtheir own and they took action accordinglyThe car loaded with dynamite whichthe strikers had sent down the tramway for the demolishment of the Friscomill had hung fire somehow and disappointed their expectations but theirnext scheme was more successful-ThewaterpowerfortheFrisco crusherwas introduced from a flume by meansof a long up slanting iron pipe calleda penstock the upper hand of whichwas accessible from the hill above themill and beyond the mines defensesThe strikers had turned off the waterthe night before and now they proceeded to load up the mill with combustiblesfrom the companys magazine shovingthe powder wrapped in gunny sacksdown the penstock till they judged thecharge was sufficient They set it offabout four oclock in the morning of the11th and the mill was blown into ruinsits red boards scattered by that windof strife all over the startled countryside and a not unsatisfactory numberof scabs and their guards who werein or near the mill at the time werekilled or injured There was no pretense of sparing life the object was totake it that good service might be rendered to the cause of unconditional allegiance to the union by this awful reminder of its power The doctor remarked when he carried the news tothe refugees in his cellar that it waslike the fable of the eagle woundedwith a shaft feathered from her ownwing to blow up the bosses withthe powder they themselves had paidforIn the fight that ensued the nonunion men were overpowered by thenumbers of their assailants and theowners having no defenses and no defenders left surrendered their property and the persons of their employes tothe leaders of the strike The nonunion miners were disarmed andmarched as prisoners to the minershall there to be guarded until the serffence of eviction from the countrywhere they had presumed to earn a living independent of labor organizationsshould be executed The agreementwhich the managers were coerced intosigning admitted the right of the unionto dictate what persons they should solely employ and at what prices This wasthe famous union ultimatum andthese the means taken to enforce it inthe Coeur dAleneThat friend of the workingman MrBingham was so impressed with thenature of the crisis that he allowedhimself to be influenced into telegraphing to the military authoritiesadjuring them to hold back the troopslest their presence in the inflamed districts might precipitate threatened actsof violence This practically was a demand from the union bosses signed bythe manager of an important mine tobe let alone with the implied threatthat if not let alone trouble would ensue bridges be blown up and minesheld down by dynamite would be exploded and the lives of innocent persons perhaps of Mr Bingham wouldbe placed in jeopardy It is not probable that the telegram had the slightesteffect in delaying the troops but it wasscarcely a true expression of the sentiment of the greater portion of the community who were willing to take theprivate risks and to bear the privatelosses for the sake of public peace andsecurityThe doctor had received earty on themorningW that black Monday a littlenote from Faith questioning him timidly in these wordsDo you know where Mr Darcie isHe left the house last evening withouta word to anyone As our guest and awounded man it is on my consciencethat he may be in danger Any help thatyou could give him in this awful timewould be I am sure only dc him fromus at the mine where he received hisinjuriesThe doctor replied briskly butevasivelj and was careful to see thathis note went straight to its destination for from the appearance of MissBinghams missive he judged that ithad been tampered withMy Dear Miss Bingham I am muchmore concerned for yourself than for anyyoung man guest Injured or otherwiseDarcie has got one good arm and a prettycool head hell get through But youmust be aware that your father cannotprotect you in the present state of affairseven if he knew the way He is completely terrorized by the strike I must beplain with you He knocked under practically months ago I would insist on yourcoming over here if I were not liable to becalled a dozen ways at once or if I wereanybody but the little doctor

Bingham This is cruel but you mustsee yourself that it is not safe nor properthat you stay in that house any longerYou must throw away all your previousnotions however nice and ladylike TheCoeur dAlene at present is not a summerresortThe doctor could not know how rapidly the managers household had beengoing to jneces in the last four andtwenty hours He had anticipated ahard time with Faith and he was speculating what other pull he could bringto bear upon her Suspecting much butknowing nothing of her relations withDarcie he dared not mention that nameto her but he mentioned her namequite frankly to Darcie that afternoonwhen he paid a visit to his lodgers in thecellar and was struck by its obviousand painful effectHe hasnt made it Im afraid thedoctor concluded reverting in thoughtto the heart solo that he had chargedupon Darcie No he hasnt made itand its taking every chip hes got topay The poor boys busted I do believe and now what becomes of mylittle planNevertheless he broached his planfor the case of Faith it seemed to himwas desperateBoys said he in his cheeriest voicewe are going to have a regular monkey and parrot time of it here till thetroops get in The militias all verywell and we shall be powerful glad tosee them but how do we know if theycan stand up to these Molly MagTin esArid Im not sure the idiots wont blowup the bridges or blow up anythingelse There is

thakindof house it is at present She has sharedthe contents of it pretty generallyamong her friends used it against youevery way she can to justify theirtreatment of jou doubtless Theydidnt know

the bloody scabthey could spare 50 men or so easy onspecial duty in a case like this and ifthey should come up here by daylightyour exit up the gulch wouldnt be soprivate as one could wishNow I propose you start not laterthan to night I will have my horse upthere in the corral by the mouth of yourwinze and when you hear my usualclinkum clahkum on the coalhod outside the kitchen door take that for asignal the coast is clear Pack up alittle grub and remember the trail isa bad one at night and dont press thepony where he hesitates you had better get down and crawl Mike knowshow amusing it is on the old trail going round Sunset peak You want tostrike for Beaver canyon by the way1of Carbon and come out at CharleyMeads place the old placer camp on theriver And there if 3 ou can get a

as it is with a horseand a wounded man and a girlA gurl echoed Mike in bluntamazement then catching the doctorsC3re he held his peace and went off tothe far end of the cellar where hebusied himself noisily hauling boxesaround and taking stock of provisionsin case they might need to put in afresh requisition for the journeyMiss Bingham must go with youthe doctor was saying to Darcie in acool peremptory tone I take the responsibility of that nryselfDarcie was turning red and whiteand his knees were shaking under himHas she said that she will go heasked avoiding the doctors eyeI havent asked her and I dont propose to What docs she know Ofcourse shed she couldnt go It istime now for the men to do somethingif there are any men left in this dastardly mine Do you know what theold man has done and the fierv littledoctor exploded again over the cowardly telegram which he said was adisgrace to the mine and to every manconnected with it The doctor refusedto set down that action of Mr Binghams to the score of humanity or concern for the companys property whichshows how loss of reputation in severalways may destroy a mans credit in thefew ways remaining and rob him of thelast charitable doubtDid you ever read a story calledBetter Dead I dont know the nameof the crank who wrote it the doctoradded modestly he wasnotliterarjinhis tastes but he hit on a good phraseright there Ive used it to my own satisfaction quite frequently since I readthe thing Theres a friend of ours notfar from this who were better deadHe is dead The vital spark has been outof him so long its indecent to havehim around and we may as well befrank about it Ive lived long enoughin the west not to have many prejudices but there are one or two thingsI cannot stand I cant stand a cowardand I cant stand a man who doesntknow how to take care of his womenfolks To see- a girl like Miss BinghamI mixed up with such an outfit as thatNow if she cant be taken out of thisplace any other way I will elope with hermyself and that might make troublein the family But- theres no need ofme when here are you two fellows whostood by her once before when the oldman went back on her And she wentunder fire

just astwo arms would have been so mortallyconvenient Im afraid the journeywill be rough on youIts no use doctor said Darciequietly in the bitterness of a despairthat was beyond words she will nevergo in the word not with me Theyhave shown her that letter and shethinks I have lied to her moreover Iaccused her to her face of opening itand reading it herselfThat was pleasant said the doctordryly Any other little endearmentspass between you Is this your international style of courtship Ive wondered how you Englishmen manage togt on so fast with our girlsWell she is thinking about yoursafety now purely on account of thereparation we owe you at the mine Itis on her conscience that she wishes sheknew where you are I havent told heryet its just as well to let you stay onher conscience awhile longer youllnever stay in a safer place and she hasgot to have something there But dontpresume upon it Has it occurred bythis time to your investigating mindthat there might be ways for a ladjto come by the contents of a letter besides helping herself to it Do youknow that the old man I wont callhim her father confronted her withthat information you have been collecting and accused her of helping youto et it and of being your wile accomplish generally -An the word ofAbbyDont make it any worse doctorpleaded Darcie humbly I know shefcan never forgive that shadow ofthought in me Yet it seemed as sheput it a simple statement of factOf what factThat she had read my letter Imnot defending myselfI should hope not the doctor coincided while Darcie was realizing thathe had purchased a great relief at theexpense of a deeper despair Supposeshe had read it She was the judgewhether she could read it or not women seem to be able to do things thatmen cant do and vice versa if youvenoticed Anyhow when a fact about agirl you believe in is impossible on theface of it I wouldnt meddle with itespecially if she furnished the fact herself Women and facts are the queerestthings when they get thoroughlymixed you have simply to choose between your woman and your facts Inyour case Darcie I neednt say Id takethe woman every timeYou would if it wasnt too latesaid Darcie It all comes to the samething she will never go with me Butif she must go perhaps she will go withMike Tel her doctor that Im notgoing I am not going Im going tostay and finish my work I came hereto do it and I shuffled

homealways follows the question Isthis your first visit to the easternshore The origin of this customwas set forth by an eastern shoremanat a Cincinnati banquet at Newport1 I some years ago when he wastwitted about this peculiarity of hiscountry The story is a true oneWhen Gen La Fayette accepted theinvitation of congress in 1S24 andcame to this country as the nationsguest a great reception was tenderedhim at the statehouse in Annapolis officially by the state The governor ofMaryland was at that time an easternshore farmer who lived on his farmexcept when the general assemblj wasin session or when he was called toAnnapolis at other times on officialbusiness Of course his presence wasindispensable at the La Fayette reception His function indeed was to introduce the distinguished guest Thegovernor made the trip on horsebackaround the head of the bay clad in ahomespun suit made on his own loomsThe roads and weather being worsethan he calculated for when he lefthome he did not reach the capital untilthe day of the reception and after allthe other notabilities were there andwaiting for the governor who washastily ushered into the senate chamber his clothes splashed with mudjust as he was when he dismountedThe distinguished people m splendidarray in the chamber confused theplain and patriotic eastern shore governor and when he was presented toLa Fayette he could think of nothingto say for the moment He blurted outIs this the first time you were ever inthis country generalAnd from the day the eastern shoregovernor made that faux pas to thisthe question is religious patriotically and proudly put to the strangerwhen his footsteps first touch the eastern shore strand Baltimore SunTips to Noblemen ServantsIn old times to dine with a noblemancost more in tips to the

improvement is always possibleat small expense even though elaborate road building- is out of the question There are three essentials ofgood highways all of which may besecured easily and at little outlay andwhich will insure vast improvement inthe roads of country districts wherethe people are unwilling or feel unableto undertake extensive improvementsFirst the road must be graded andflrained so that water can neitherstaud upon the surface nor soak inunder the foundation Water is ruin-ROAD NEAR ELMIRA N Yous to a road in either of these locations and if allowed to remain inthem will speedily work complete destruction An expensive stone roadthat is inadequately drained will sufferjust as surely and fatally from wateron or in it as the most ordinary country road Disintegration and complete breaking up are only a matter oftime and a short time at thatThe second essential is found in theestablishment of a workable methodical system of care and repair by districts whose responsible heads willutilize time and labor to advantage andget the best possible results that canbe btained from the local conditionsand facilities This of course meansthe abolishment of working taxes thesubstitution of money taxes and theemployment of a competent intelligent corps of workersFinally the roads can be compactedsmoothed and hardened by the use onvehicles of wide tires and axles of unequal length Repeated experimentsand tests of the actual saving in powerby these means have proved it to bevery great experience in localitieswhere they have been tried have givenmost satisfactory results and manyforeign countries enforce their use Itis in effect the use of a constant streamof steam rollers passing along thehighway instead of a series of weightsbeing rolled along on knife like edgeswhich cut apart and tear up as they goThese changes and improvementscan be made at small cost to any community and will speedily demonstratethe value of good roadi L A Y

law abidingpeople of Kentucky do not rise in theirmajesty and might and put an end tothe present system of licensed robberyWhat is really wanted is not toll gateraids but the hanging of a few

right out of hand saying nevera word In Jefferson county alone 30000 annually are wrung from the people upon the pretext of road makingJt is safe to say that not one third ofihis vast sum is ever devoted to thepurpose intended whilst two thirds ofit goes into the pockets of the heartless bloodsuckers masquerading asroad overseers and rascally contractors with whom these are in partnershipAs a rule the county judges eitherknow nothing about it or care nothingabout it Meanwhile the poor farmerstands off with his fingers in his mouthas dumb as a post and as helpless as acalf Year after year

enough We have one now on thisjjlace that at four weeks gets 25pounds of skimmilk a day and besides all the bright hay it wants whichis a good deal And with this liberalfeeding it is a beaut and as forgrowth as the hired man expresses itbeats any calf 1 ever did see Tjhetrouble with not only calves but mostyoung stock is that they do not getenough A growing boy will eat morethan a grown man and the growingcalf wants enough or it will not begrowing calfA writer in the National Stockmantakes up the subject of veal productionand argues that it is more profitableto grow veal during the period of lowpriced butter than to make the milkinto butter We know of several dairymen already who follow thispracticewith success They buy all the calvesthat are brought to them by the milkprodticers of rhe vicinity and as fastas fattened their places are taken byother calves obtained in tlie same wayThe writer referred to says Thetrade in fine veal which is enlargingcould be increased much beyond itspresent limits by supplying a highgrade article for the market I am notaware that the dislinction is made inAmerican markets regarding the quality of veal which is made in some European countries notably in Holland But no doubt the time will comewhen this feature of the dairy industry will receive the attention from uswhich is now Leing given to it elsewhere It is considered by expertsthat those veals arc finest which nobonly carry a considerable quantity offat but which a so shew no indicationsof having receh ed any other food thanwhole milk The whites of the eyesthe eyelids and the inside of the lipsif the animal has had an exclusive milkdiet should be pure white Any tingeof coloring in these parts indicatesthe effect of solid foods Whether itwill pay to convert milk into cheapbutter instead ci putting it into primeveal will depend entirely of courseupon the price of the two productsand the relation one bears to theother It is stated by authorities thateight pounds of milk will produce onepound of gain in a calf This meansthat at present prices 5 cents forveal a hundred pounds of milk wouldbring 72 cents if put into veal Withbutter at 17 cents netting the producer about l iys cents a hundredpounds of milk made into butterwould be worth about G5 cents Thisdifference in profits points stronglyin favor of veal especially as the priceof butter will in all probability decline markedly n the next six or eightweeks while the price of veal willprobably not go lower Hence it appears that large quantities of milkwhich will be made into poor cheapbutter this summer might much better be turned into veal Xot only wouldthe raising of prime veal benefit theproducer in the way we have shownbut it would also relieve the buttermarket of just so much butter

accurate and the presentation was the occasion of much ceremony The company wasdrawn up in a long line company front1 believe is the military term lor it and avery charming young lady read a verycharming and somewhat lengthy addresswhich contained a great deal of flowery language The captain was -it then and hadto reply He is not an eloquent man at anytime and he is extremely shy but he hadwritten out a graceful speech of acceptance and he stepped forward confidentlyand received the bannerLadies he began in a Fourth of Julyvoice Ladies Ave will accept this flag Ladies we we will accept this flag Herehis color forsook him He had forgotten thebest of his speech One trembling handsought the pocket of his blouse The manuscript was goneLadies he began again desperatelywith a

inquired as to the age ofPettus and when informed said he wastoo old Senator Pugh communicatedthis fact to Pettus and also suggestedto another eminent but younger lawyerin his state to apply for the

tasseled fez on his headand spectacles on his nose The oddestthing about him was that he sat on hishaunches writh his paws in the airactually smoking a cigarette like a confirmed cigarette fiend I

was the biggestgoat I ever saw almost as large as aShetland pony with big branchinghorns and perfectly tame He playfullybutted the girls or pranced aroundamong them His best trick howeverwas the larceny of their dinner basketsHe used to go nosing around until hefound a particularly choice luncheonHe would knock over the basket seizethe lunch and dash outdoors with itNo amount of chastisement
