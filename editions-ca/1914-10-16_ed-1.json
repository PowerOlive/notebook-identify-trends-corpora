HORSEMEN TO TRY FOR
NEW FAIR CIRCUIT.
Efforts will be made the coming
winter to organize a trotting and fair
circuit in Central Kentucky, and a
meeting of the various fair secreta
ries and others interested will prob
ably be held in Lexington for that pur
pose some time in November or De
cember. Years ago there was a cir
cuit, composed of Frankfort, Ver
sailles, Richmond, Danville, Winches
ter, Mt. Sterling, Paris, Maysville,
Harrodsburg and Lexington, and much
interest was exhibited. In late years
there have been only three trotting
meetings in this section Mt. Sterling,
Berea and Falmouth. It is planned to
have the circuit start in July and race
through that month, August and Sep
tember. BECKHAM AND BRYAN.
Governor Beckham has always been
the friend of Wm. Jennings Bryan.
He supported him in his three races
for the Presidency, not only in the
conventions that nominated him, but
in hundreds of speeches in this and
other States. Governor Beckham was
for Mr. Bryan in the Baltimore con
vention, and the presence of the Sec
retary of State in Kentucky at this
time is a personal compliment to Gov.
Beckham. Not even the President
has a greater following in Kentucky
than Mr. Bryan. " He is the idol of
thousands of Democrats who admire
his courage and ability. The presence
of Mr. Bryan in Kentucky will bring
thousands of votes to the entire Demo
cratic ticket. He brings a message
from the President appealing for two
Senators from Kentucky and that
prayer will be answered in November.
OLYMPIAN SPRINGS SOLD.
Acting for a syndicate of business
men, Judge Mathew Walton, of Lex
ington, Wednesday, purchased the
Olympian Springs Hotel property, con
sisting of grounds, buildings and furni
ture, for $35,000. The sale was made
by John P. Haswell, Jr., trustee, un
der, an order of Federal Judge A. M.
J. Cochran's court.
The sale was made necessary be
cause of financial difficulties into
which the Springs management were
plunged early in the yar and which
practically spoiled the season for the
hotel. The new owners expect to ad
vertise the property and to make it
one of the most popular resorts in
Kentucky.

A WONDERFUL COW.
From the Boston Post comes this
little story anent an advertisement
purporting to be genuine:
"For Sale Excellent cow ;
gives three gallons of milk, also
good piano and five tons of hay.
Come quick! Address, "
(name and address withheld.)
" Mass Newspaper.
"We should call that quite some
cow. We have personally known a
few very prolific cows, but never had
the honor of being acquainted with a
cow that could deliver the goods di
rect from producer to consumer with
the prolificness of the above bovine.
We do not know what this cow might
be bought for, but she would be cheap
at almost any price. A cow that will
yield three gallons of milk, a piano
and five tons of hay would pay for
herself at- one milking, we should
think. If. she yields this same amount
of milk, musical instruments and al
falfa daily she should be worth to her
owner several thousand of dollars
per week.
"It must be a fierce job to milk her.
The man who wants to sell her prob
ably needs help in this respect,
hence his S. O: S. call of distress.
'Come Quick!'"

EUROPEAN WAR IN BRIEF.
Ostend is. now the .center" of interest
in the contest being waged in the
western theater of war. Reports indi
cate that there,, isnow virtually no
obstacle in the way of tlie German ad
vance on Ostend and other ports in
the northwest of Belgium..
Scores, of wounded soldiers are be
ing brought into Ostend from Ghent.
It is reported that the allies and the
Germans engaged in a serious battle
near Ghent Monday.
The extreme right wing of the
main German army has been forced to
fall back before an assault by the al
lies, and reports indicate that the in
vaders will encounter strong opposi
tion in attempting to extend their
right wing across to the Northern
French ports.
Across the border Ypres has been
occupied bythe alied forces. This in
dicates a decided gain for the allies.
In the eastern theater the Russians
on October 13 successfully pressed
back the German forces on the left
bank of the Vistula on the road lead
ing from Warsaw to Ivarigorod, ac
cording to an official communication
issued by the Russian General Staff.
Fighting continues to the south of
Prezmysl, Galicia, says the statement.
An official announcement, given out
in Vienna, says that the Austrian
troops advancing toward Przemysl
have repulsed the encircling Russian
troops in such a way that the enemy
now is able to maintain his position
only before the eastern front of the
fortress. It is said that during this
fighting several military bridges over
the San broke down during the Rus
sian retreat and many of the Russians
were drowned. Fighting continued
east of Chyrow, Galicia.
From Nish, Servia, comes the offi
cial statement that on Sunday night
the Austrians made two attacks on the
extreme right wing of the Servian
front, between Svornik, Bosnia, and
Lcsnitpa, Servia. The attacks were
repulsed with heavy losses to the
Austrians, it is claimed.
LONDON, Oct. 14. There was
every inication to-day that Turkey
and Portugal would be drawn into the
war. Portugal has not declalred war
on Germany, as was reported in the
day, but a partial mobilization of her
forces will be ordered to-morrow, and
martial law has been declared in Por
tugese Congo.
Portugal has an alliance with Great
Britain, but this is purely a defensive
one, and was negotiated for the pro
tection of Portugal, and not with the
idea that Portugal ever should be call
ed upon to the assistance of Great
Britain.
PETROGRAD, Oct. 14 It is report
ed that the first attack of the Germans
on warsaw already has been hurled
back. To the north, in the region of
Grodno and TSuwalki, where the Ger
mans recently sustained a great de
feat, the rumor is widespread that the
Kaiser himself is in command of the
troops and is directing operations.

AMERICAN RCD CROSS
. nursm, in Europe.
1 In the last issue Jf the News was
printed an interesting letter to Mrs
Minnaker, the Health and Welfare
League' yisiting nurse, 'in this city
from one of the nurses who went
from Cincinnati recently to Europe as
Red Cross nurse. Since then a letter
from Miss Helen Hay, general super
intendent of nurses, says that the
nurses will be known as "Sisters"
explaining that the custom is to
adopted because it willbe esaier for
the sick and wounded to remember
Christian names prefixed by "Sister"
than if the American style of "Miss
Hay," etc., was retained.
The voyage of the Red Cross nurses
from New York to England, the letter
states was most profitably spent.
Practical demonstrations of the use
of military, surgical equipment, lect
ures upon camp sanitation, infectious
diseases and plagues were delivered
daily by the surgeons with prayer ser
vices for peace always following.
The steamer was molested only ones
during the voyage. A British crui3er
came up and played its searchlight
upon the "mercy ship," but when the
Red Cross signal was displayed it was
promptly accepted and the cruiser
sailed on.
SUES FOR DIVORCE.
In the Court News in Wednesday's
Cincinnati Enquirer is the following
regarding the martial troubles of
Thomas Longo, at present a Paris citi
zen: "'Brutal abuse' for six years after
their marriage is what Rosa Lonsjo
declares she received from Thomas
Longo, and she is asking for a di
vorce and to be restored to" her maid
en name of Palmisano. They were
married February 15, 1905, and have
three children. The wife alleges that
Longo drove her away from his hoip
in Paris, Ky., over three years ago.
J. E. Rappoport, attorney."
Longo is at present conducting a
fruit store and confectionery in the
Kiely building "on Main street, in
Paris.

What has become of the old-fashioned

cooked and served the way Father
wanted it?
Why is it that the more common
sense a woman has the homlier she is?
If you try long enough you can
train your conscience to speak only
when it is spoken to.
One reason why old Mr. Opportuni
ty raps on your door as often as old
Mr. Trouble 'is because sparrows are
thicker than canaries.
After glancing over some of the

Great Grandpa called them gazel

A lot of men wonder why girls close
their eyes when they are being kissed.
But if the men would look into a mir

To a woman anything that is stylish
is becoming.
This would be a much nicer world if
we had more songs without words.
We all have a lot of theories we
