t Folowing a short illness, due to

familiarly known as "Jeff," one of
the best-known and most popular
farmers in the county, died at the

his new home on the Clintonville
pike, near this city, had resided in
the old Kiser home, near Mt, Car
mel. He was -a successful farmer, a
man of genial disposition, and one
who made and retained life-long
friends. He was active in the busi
ness world and gave of his means to
every charitable object without stint.
Mr. Kiser was twice married, his
first marriage being to Miss Nannie
Remington, daughter of the late Mr.
and Mrs. B. F. Remington, of Paris,
and a sister of Mr. William Reming
ton, of the Paris Democrat, and Mr.
Frank Remington. His second marri
age was to Miss Rout, of Harrison
county. He is survived by two sis
ters, Mrs. Isaac Keller, of Kiserton,
and Mrs. Fannie Smith, of Paris;
two brothers, Walker Kiser and Jas.

ton; and five sons, Mr. Frank P.
Kiser, confidential business agent for

Kiser, Councilman Thos. P. Kiser, all
of Paris, and Emmett Kiser and H.

MUST LIST PROPERTY BY SEP?
TEMBER OR BE SUED.
That some Bourbon county property-owners
who have failed to list
their property Jgpr the 1920 assess
ment have neglected the matter be
cause of their ignorance of the pro
visions of the State tax law, is the
opinion expressed by County Tax
Commissioner Walter Clark.
"Persons who owned a certain
piece of property on or before the
first of July of this year, must list
it for 1920 assessment," said Mr.
Clark, "whether they have disposed
of it since July 1, or not. The fig
ures for the assessment are as of July
1, 1919, and have nothing to do with
changes after that date. Persons who
failed to list their property for assess
ment by September 1 probably will
Jiave their names left off the 1920
Mfetsment books and will lay them
selves liable to suits for back taxes
and a penalty. Under the State tax
law the county assessor is instructed
t- "'
"Wood Home," for many years the
home of the late Senator Garrett
Davis,' was purchased recently from
the heirs of the late James E. Ford
hy James McClure, Cashier of the
First National Bank, of Paris. Mc
Clure made the purchase as a home
for his son, Lieutenant James Winn
McClure, of the United State Army,
who is now stationed at Schoolfield
Barracks, Hawaiian Islands. The
tract contains twenty-two acres and
is situated on Winchester street,
near the city limits of Paris.
To the older residents of Paris
this hostorc spot is linked with the
life of Garrett Davis, one of the
greatest of many great men of Ken
tucky, who spent the greater part of
his illustrious life within its confines,
and where at various times some of
the great minds of the country were
entertained.
Many residents of Paris remember
the active political career of Senator
Davis as an old line Whig; his in
tense loyalty and personal and polit
ical friendship for Henry Clay, the
great commoner, and for his illus
trious service to his county, his State
and his party.
- As a lawyer, orator and statesman
Senator Davis had few equals. He was
a native of Montgomery county, hav
ing been borninMt. Sterling on Sep
tember 10, 1801. He died at "Wood
Home" on September 29. 1872.
His first political office was that of
Circuit Court Clerk of Montgomery"
county. In 1823 he located Jn Paris
and began the practice of his profes
sion as a lawyer. His first wife was a
daughter of Robert Trimble, of Paris,
Justice of the Supreme Court of the
United States. His second wife was
a Miss Elliott, daughter of a promi
nent lawyer of Paris. He has a son
surviving,- Garrett M. Davis, a citizen
of Washington for many years.
Mr. Davis served his State many
times in the Legislature, and for
eight consecutive terms reperesented
the Ashland District in the Lower
House of Congress.
In the United States Senate he
was a commanding figure, recognized
as a skillful debator and orator.
When first elected Senator he suc
ceeded John C. Breckinridge, who re
signed to enter the service of the
Confederacy. ,
The body of Senator Davis rests in
the Paris cemetery, as does that of
his distinguished father-in-law, Jus
tice Robert Trimble. Upon the occa
sion of his funeral eulogies were de
livered by Senators Stephenson, of
Kentucky; Cameron, of Pennsylva
nia; Thurman, of Ohio; Sumner, of
Massachusetts; Bayard, of Delaware;
Trumbell, of Illinois, and many
others.
It is the intention of the new own
er to remodel the place along the
same line it was during the lifetime
of its noted owner, and as he already
possesses a part of the Kenningham
property adjoining, when completed
the two together will comprise one of
the most desirable estates in the
Bluegrass region.
