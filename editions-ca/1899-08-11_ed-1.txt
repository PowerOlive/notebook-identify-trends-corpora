atria and Other Papers Combat ThUIdea and Suggest Absolute Independence The Discuscion SaysIt Would Ue UnpatrioticHavana 9 The recently announced programme of the Nuevolais for Cuban independence underan American protectorate has been theleading topic in the press of Havanaand the provinces during the last fortnight and will probably continue themost prominent subject for some timeto comeThe Patria the protectorate idea favors the absolute independence claiming that Cuba can obtain favors from the framers of theAmerican tariff regulations withoutsurrendering her political sovereigntyThe Discuscion on the other handposing as the defender o Cuban libresa3s it would be shameful and grosslyunpatriotic to surrender islands now ina state of freedom for no other reasonthan to protect the sugar producersand exportersIn response to the comments of thePatria on the subject the Nuevo Paisreminds its contemporary that Cubahas been is and under whatever flagor form of government will continueto be commercially dependent on theUnited States without whose marketsfor her products the island would soonbv come impoverishedContinuing the Nuevo Pais reasonsthat the form of government eventually to be conceded to Cuba dependsmore upon American popular opinionand the American congress than uponthe will of the Cuban people themselves however freely they may express themselves It says Somemiddle ground must be found where allmay be brought togetherThe paper then gives various reasonsof greater or less strength in supportof its belief that the solution destinedto be accepted by all in the compromise that must finally come will benominal independence under a protectorate Senor Capote the Nuevo Paiscalls Cubas new Faust It subjectshim to scathing criticism as an inconsistent political demagogueThe Cardenas Herald asks the public men of Cardenas why they havenot had a meeting- in connection withthe national party and says even theHavana Herald a foreign paper urgesthe importance of the union of CubansThe Nuevo Pais repljring to an attack by Senor Capote the chief of theCuban cabinet of advisors and formerpresident of the Cuban assembly onthe idea of American protectorate askshim how to get rid of the Americans ifthey do not want to go adding thatthe future of Cuba is absolutely in thehands of the Americans Mayor Lacostes order closing the stores atoclock

embassy hereon his personal investigation of therecent lynching of hve Italians atTailulah LaThe report presents the affair in aserious light As a whole the Italianauthorities view the matter of thelynching as one of unusual atrocityand without the mitigatinginces which had been urged in previous affairs of this kindIn describing the first affray whichled to the lynching Marquis Romanosreport states that Dr Hodges was thefirst to draw his weapon and that notuntil he had fired one shot and wasabout to fire the second one Charles Difata who was at that time pro t rateon the ground did the brother Joe Difata fire his shotgun from the store nearbyThis last shot it is pointed out wasin defense of the fallen brother andwas not a wanton attack upon Drllodg es The circumstances Leadingup to the affray are described in detailAccording- to this account CharlesDifata was alone when Dr HodgespassedThere is n 5 effort made in the reportto obscure the fact that Charles Difatamade the first offensive overtures butit is contended that this was not accompanied by the use of firearms oreven a movement to draw them It issaid however that Charles Difata upbraided Dr Hodges in an offensiveway for having killed an animal andaccompanied this by a blow of the fistThen it is stated Dr Hodges shot atDifata Whether or not the shot tookeffect it was not possible for the Italianauthorities to learn as the bodies ofthe men after being lynched were disfigured and disposed of But at allevents is is stated that Charles Difatawas on the ground following the shotfrom Dr Hodges weaponAt this point Joe Difata made hisappearance and seeing his brotherdown and a second shot about to befired shot at Dr HodgesThen followed the lvnching of thesetwo Italians Joe Difata and CharlesDifata The mob

three other ItaliansFrank Difata Joseph Feducio and JohnCerami were in another street and didnot know what was occuringIt is stated that they did not takepart in the attack on Dr Hodges andthat they did not even know of it untilsome time after when the local officers came to arrest them This arrestwas accomplished and the three Italians were actually placed in iail Thereport then brings out the mob having already lynched Charles and JoeDifata turned their attention to thethree Italians under arrest Two ofthese men Joseph Feducio and FrankDifata were first taken from the officers and lynched Subsequentl andsome Little time afterwards the mobreturned and took John Cerami andlynched him In this circumstantialway the report brings out that themob made three distinct movementsagainst the Italians and that therewas sufficient time for the blood tocool and for the anger of the 13 nehersto abate after they had disposed of thefirst two menParticular importance is laid uponthis feature for while it is said theremay have been some extenuating circumstances in visiting- such summarypunishment on those immediately concerned in the affray with Dr Hodgesyet the time elapsing between the second and third lynchings is regarded asan element of particular atrocityThe full report has been forwardedto the Italian foreign office aud a copyof it placed in the hands of the statedepartmentA

of the ChineNt CombineExplained by nn Educated Mongolian Trut Meaning of theTern HlirliDinderfSpeeial Washington LetterIt seldom happens to one of our peopleto have an opportunity to converse withan educated Chinaman one whocanusethe English language with facilityTherefore it was a treat for the writerto recently spend an hour in conversation with a polished and cultured gentleman of that race who told manynew and interesting things about hiscountry and his peopleIn reply to an inquiry concerning theSix Companies and the Highbindershe nravp in elaborate description ofF I41hem which is herewith reproduced0111 niemorv In a newspaper thereappeared a dispatch concerning thethreat of one Chinaman against another the threat of death unless 500should be paid to a highbinder Thenewspaper account gave no particularsand the average reader would supposethat brigandage was carried on byhighbinders and with the consent ofthe people in the Chinese quarterWhenever any act of violence iscommitted by a Chinaman it is customary in this country to attribute itto a highbinder when as a matter offact highbinders are not guilty of anyinjustice and certainly ere not responsible for brigandage or law Lessnesso that character But first let us understand the Six Companies then wecan understand the highbinders betterWhen you read in the n w -papers political editorials denouncing trustsand when you hear orators of all political parties shouting themselveshoarse and growing red in the faceaud big in the neck with their patrioticdeclamations von may understand thaithey are denouncing something olderthan America as a factor in the affairsof the world Long before Columbussecured the support which enabled himto cross the ocean and discoi er t his continent and long before Eric the Redsailed from Iceland to the coast of Massachusetts trusts were in vogue inChina This shows that there is nothing new under the sunThe Six Companies constitute atrust and a powerful combination itis too Just how old it is cannot bestated although of course the branchin this country has been in existencebut a limited number of years Buttrusts have existed in China fromtime immemorial Long before therewas any Fourth of July to celebratein this country the Chinese were making gunpowder and making firecrackers and the goods were disposed of bya trustThis Six Companies trust was organized by merchants for their ownbetterment It became necessary because competition was strong andruinous to trade There was one bodyof merchants doing business in HongKong and there were five companiesdoing business in Canton They wereconstantly cutting prices and undermining each other until they all realised that ruin was before them and sofor self protection and advancementthey pooled their issues and formed theA CHINESE GENTLEMANSix Companies the strongest trustin the world Of course they shutoutof business many smaller dealers butthat is one of the results of the lawof the survival of the fittest and theChinese recognize that law spontaneouslyThe headquarters of the Chinese SixCompanies are in Canton and theAmerican headquarters are at SanFrancisco and the Six Companies haverepresentatives all over the worldwherever there is to be found a colony o 1000 or more Chinese peopleAll orders and all transactions ultimately go on recorel in the home offices at Canton China There is wherethe bulk of the money made goes tooZSot only is this a trust which iscontrary to the modern ideas of ourpeople but it is a trust organized fordealing in human beings The principal business of the Six Companies issupplying oolie labor in large fieldsof enterprise vch as building railroads mining and ordinary labor requiring no special skill or fitness forpeculiar employment The Six Companies supply Chinese laborers for themines of Brazil Chili Eeuaelor Boliviaand other countries They furnish laborers for the guano deposits of Peruand for the Peruvian niter beds At onetime there were 12000 Chinese coolielaborers employed on the Pacific railroads and mai y of them are still employed on those roads keeping them inrepairThis trafhe in human beings is notsailed slavery or slave trade becausethe Six Companies do not sell their human cattle They hire them out Theyreceive a stipulated sum for the workof their hands and they also receivepayment from each coolie for procuring employment for him The cooliesare therefore free but to all intentsaud purposes they are slaves Nevertheless they look upon the Six Companies as ptTblic benefactors They areprovided with employment and havetheir transportation paid for themwhich of course they have to pay backThe coolies are paid about 25 permonth The Six Companies contract toprovide the board and lodging for theircoolies and they charge enough to almost absorb all of their earnings Consequently this trust which deals inhuman beings simply permits thecoolies to live and make rich their beuefactors by their toilNow be it understood that the SixCompanies employ highbinders justas American corporations may do Youmust understand that a highbinder isimply an executive ollicer or chief ofpolice or a sort of sheriff The SixCompanies have no connection with anyof the secret societies which existamong Chinamen but all secrets YkfJWORKING HIS WA1 TO INDEPENDENCEties have their highbinders There tireprobably not more than 200 certainlynot more than 300 highbinders in thiscountryNow to understand what a highbinder really is you must know that theChinese colonieV in this country havetheir own methods of governmentbased on Chinese laws They obey allof our laws except the laws againstgambling They violate the gamblinglaws of this country just as white mendo But while observing our laws theymaintain the law s of China and executethem as faithfully as they can Theyelect a mayor and common council foreach colony The mayor presides atbanquets receives distinguished guestsreports to the Chinese consul till matters which may be of interest to theChinese government- furnishes aid tothe distressed and arbitrates disputesThe mayor of each community musthave an officer to execute his orders tocarry official documents and nametrustees of property of deceased Chinamen also to execute the Chinese lawseven to the extent of taking life Thisexecutive officer is the highbinderNow you see the popular impressionthat there is a secret order of highbinders is erroneous Each highbinderis alone in the performance of his duties and has no official or social relation with any other highbinderReferring to the secret societies ofChinamen in this country it must beknown that each society maintainsthree classes of charitable funds forthe sick or wounded for the care ofwidows and orphans and for the burialof the dead or their transportation toChina These charitable funds are heidso inviolable that embezzlement is regarded as an unpardonable crime Theembezzler of charitable trust funds isinvariably punished with death Thehighbinder performs his sworn dutywhen he executes such a criminal Andit is a fact that nine out of every tenChinamen executed by highbinders hasbeen discovered given fair trial andbeen convicted of stealing charitablefluidsNow with this understanding of thesituation the highbinder is notsuch abad fellow after allThe Six Companies are obliged to employ highbinders to enforce contractswhenever any Chinaman is derelict butthat seldom happens Besides furnishing coolie labor by the thousand andmaking plenty of money out of themthe Six Companies discovered that theLaundry business in this country wasprofitable They conveyed the word toChina and offered to furnish transportation to every Chinaman who wantedto come to this country also to furnishthe money to set him up in businesseach beneficiary to pay back to the SixCompanies double the amount thus investeel in monthly installments Doublepayment having been made the laundry business was to belong to the individual making the paymentNow you know how it happens thatthere are so many Chinamen here in thelaundry business Every moon facedMongolian whom you see ironing nearthe window of his Laundry is pushingthat hot iron along the pathway to independence Be hopes some day to ownhis own laundry After that he maybemayor councilman or highbinder Beknows that he can never be president ofthe United States or even a policemanbut he wants to be independent andhe deserves credit for his labor and hisambition to rise even to the dignity ofbeing a highbinder SMITH D FRYA

of the west we have concluded thatthere is not much business wisdom inburning straw stacks or regarding themanure pile as a nuisance The manureis a part of the return from keepingand feeding domestic animals just asclearly a part as the carcass is andthrowing away the meat milk or woolof the animal would be just as sensibleas throwing1 awav the manure In anelaborate article before us the statement is made that experiments indicate that manure should be collectedin pits having impervious walls andbottom If a farmer should constructa pit like that he would be a fit subject for a lunatic asylum If anybodydesires to hoard manure to keep itin sight and indolence he had betterhave a covered barnyard But the landis the place for the manure and thereis where it should go just as fast as itis made and it is convenient to haul itout -he farmer who will persist inpermitting his manure to burn out orleach out in the barnyard might not bemore anwise if he built a water tightpit or adopted some other expensivecontrivance to preserve the fertilizingelements and forking the manure intothe i it and especially forking it outmigbt be considered a deserved punishment But the best advice to be

Only InStuck hieh Has Access to Ergoa Plant FiiiikuuFollowing is a brief description of thedisease termed ergotism This disease is caused by stock eatiDg ergotwhich is found in the feed Ergot innot a species of weed as is sometimesthought but is a stage in the life history of a fungus The term was applied to it by the French from its fancied resemblance to the spur of a eoekThe scientific name is Claviceps purpurea Spores of the fungus areformed and carried by currents of airO other means to the flowers of thegrasses favorable for its developmentHere the ergot is developed entirelybelow the ovary and prevents the formation of the grass seed Full development oecurs about one monthafter the invasion of the ovary takesplace The grains of ergot differ insize but are essentially the same inshape Sometimes the grains are sosmall that they are difficult to distinguish with the naked eye Usuallythe size varies in length from one halfan inch to over an inch and in diameter from one fifteenth to one sixthThey are cylindrical sometimes slightly ribbed and furrowed and often irregularly fissured They are curvedaDd taper toward the ends Theircolor varies from dark violet to blueblack or blackJust what poison is contained in thetTgot is unknown yet the fact that apoison does exist there cannot be disputed The poisoning of animals byor shorter time even weeks or

day it is extremely difficult to keep eggs even a fewdays without starting the germ togrowing Of course this ruins the eggand as during the night the cool airchills the egg it is good for nothingeven for incubation Many farmersmake the cellar the place where theystore their eggs until they have achance to market them The truth isthat in summer it is not best to haveeggs longer than three or four days after they are laid before disposing ofthem The cellar often has very unwholesome air and as the egg shell isporous its contents are affected injuriously without regard to the temperature where it has been keptWhen to Harrow ltinilLand should be harrowed after plowing before the clods become hard anddifficult to crush and the surface madeas fine as possible Frequent harrowing of lands
