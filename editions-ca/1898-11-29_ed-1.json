or Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
money without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and walth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE W -
The famous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York and theiBuell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents thai se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor poiicy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven per cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understandings of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
