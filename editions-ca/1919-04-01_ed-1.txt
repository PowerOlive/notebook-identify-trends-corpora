The big carplunged down the hill, and went overthe embankment near the corner ofVine street and Stoner avenue, whichwas unprotected by a fence, an4hung there for a short space of time.Taking another plunge, the carcareened still further down the steepembankment until its progress wasstopped by a stout young tree. Thedriver of the machine reversed andendeavored to back the car up thehill, but the wheels sinking deep inthe-soft earth, held securely.The Martin garage was notified ofthe accident, and a big motor truckwas sent to the scene. The car wasrescued from its perilous position andstarted on its way again. Had it notbeen for the tree stopping its downward plunge, the car- would havelanded in the creek. The embankment at the point where the carwent over is very high and steep.oTOBACCO GROWERS TO EFFECTORGANIZATION.15. 6 and 1.

Theresults of the girls' tournament heldnere the 14th and 15th of Marchgave the first honors to the Lexington team and second honors to Paris.The cups were ordered promptly andare now heing engraved by A. J.Winters & Co. The presentationswill be made during the presentweek, it is hoped, and it will be anoccasion for congratulation to thecoach, Miss Bannister, the efficientsong and yell leader, Miss Porter,squad and all of those who contributed in any way to make this sucha delightful and successful season.While the boys will not be awarded a cup this year, their work deserves much praise. Unfortunatelytheir tournament was: played at Lexington at the same time at which thegirls' was played here, so it was notpossible to give them the loyal support they deserved. They defeatedGeorgetown overwhelmingly and imtup a splendid fight against Somerset.There seems to be no reason whyParis boys should not carry off theState championship next year, as theParis girls .did this year.But probably more interesting toboth the boys and the girls thaneither of the cups, are the sweaterswhich have been ordered for them.The girls will be given white Bradley sweaters with orange and blackletters and the boys will have Bradley athletic sweaters of orange andblack, with the official basket ballletters. These sweaters have beenordered by Mr. John Davis and willbe here very soon.

Ifthey could have their way about it,tb call would be made at once, becc e things have come to such apo . in government departments thato2i ials are at their wits end to knowwhich way to turn next to keep thewheels of business .going. Lack offunds is the whole cause, and Congress is the only remedy. The havocwrought by the failure of the lastCongress' to pass' appropriation billst must be speedily corrected as soonas the extra session meets, but eventhen it will be months afterward before affairs will be running anywherenear a normal condition.The government owes millions ofdollars to firms, individuals and corporations for supplies it boughtmonths ago, and now it must askindulgence at the hands of its creditors. And supplies bought now areJbefng procured "on tick," althoughthe money for them is being collected from the people in the form oftaxes, but there is no authority to&zy it out Hundreds of employes inmany departments have been discharged and have returned to theirhomes in the State because of lackof funds; while others axe' workingwithout" pay, hoping that Uncle SamwiH do the right thing by them intime, as they are doing by him now.Never before have conditions in government departments in Washingtonteep. so chaotic in regard to finances,. and it is likely that they will go fromb&l to worse until Congress comes to, Tiber, rescue,-.JT. .

He rulesIn Urga. It is the capital of Mongolia, and the potentate Is at the sametime the official head of a religion.He Is, In fact, the Mongol pope.Urga Is to some extent a moderntown, having many Chinese and Russian Inhabitants; but the native portion of It bears no resemblance toanything that can be found anywhereelse on earth. For this Mongol partof the city Is mpvable and constantlychanges its location and arrangementThe Mongol" houses are hemispherical huts of felt cloth extended overa light structure of latticework. Theyare readily collapsible, and can be putup or taken down at a few minutes'notice Felt cloth being an excellentInsulator, they afford a warm andweatherproof shelter during wintersof extreme cold.There are at Urga, however, a number of large monasteries. It Is theholy city of the Mongols. The priests(called "lamas") are numbered by hundreds of thousands, and their "lamaseries" are scattered all over thecountry.The business of the lamas is to driveaway the devils which, but for theirpious activity, would soon destroy allthe people.

Bernhardt'8 admiration for Edmond Rostand was due in part atleast to natural human gratitude.When once a guest of the great actressat Belle Isle, her lonely Island homenear Qulberon, the- distinguisheddramatist- had rescued her fromdrowning. But opart from this she'always swore by him. I have heardher rhapsodize in terms that seemedextravagant about his genius. Hewas tn her the beginning aiid endof that form of the drama in whichsho had excelled asrn interpreter.She loved him as a reaction visibleagainst realism, as a protest againstIbsen and a renewer or the flamboyant in art. Yet who can doubt thatwhen Rostand Is forgotten men willknow Ibsen? The romantic episode atBelle Isle merely strengthened Mme.Bernhardt's profound and touchingfaith In this follower of Hugo. Exchange. Getting Down to Business.If there's any one thing that marksthe big man it l his ability to getdown to business. While the averagefellow sits drumming at his desk theman of skill starts things. There maybe a thousand things to do, but theywill be done sooner if they are doneone at a time. It's a fine thing to beable at a glance to spot the essentialand go at It. The next best thing is toget busy at the job that seems to bemost urgent and put that on the shelfa finished product. You are then, readyfor the next thing. But it's just thelack, of this ability that puts thesprags in ,most men's progress. Theyare confused by the many things tobe done.. Instead of getting busy atonce they waste time in wonderingwhere to begin.

With us it didnot attain the proportions of a hurricane. It didn't claim lives by themillion, devastate the land by thethousands of square miles, didn't demolish our cities and strip our industries. It didn't take up altogetherunawares.Now that the sun is shining oncemore we must make hay.Uncle Sam is sending out a hurrycall for his harvest hands the Victory Liberty Loan.He asks them to come promptlyand not empty handed. To bringtheir tools.For the world at large to-day ishis harvest field. The world trade hiscrop ripe for the cutting.But every manjack of us must beon the Job if we hope to get it in.We can't do it by lazing around mthe fence corners swapping yarns., We can't do it by laying back looking at the rainbow and wondering ifthere is really a pot of gold at eitherend.We've got to get out into the field.Got to lend Uncle Sam our tools.So set your alarm clock for daybreak.

Kentucky is lending its assistance to theFederal Department of Agriculturein its campaign for the elinination ofdogs and the acquisition of sheep, itwas learned at the Bureau of AnimalIndustry here recently. Recognitionof the work that is being accomplished in the Bluegrass State along thisline will be contained in an articlethat will be published in a coming issue of the Department of Agriculture's weekly news bulletin.The article will be as follows:"For every dog kept a loss of$36.50 must be pocketed every year.For every sheep kept a profit of$27.60 may be pocketed every year."At least, that is the way the proposition was itemized on the blackboard of a mountain schoolhouse by afarm-demonstration agent in Kentucky. And the figures were convincing. There was not. a sheep m thedistrict at the time the figures wereplaced on the blackboard. Somebodysaid there used to be one sheep awether "down the mountain aways," but the dogs ate him."A few weeks from the time theagent placed the figures on the boardfifteen boys each had contrived tobuy a sheep. Eleven dogs had beenkilled. Several other families, pestered by their small sons, but still unwilling to kill their dogs, were tryingto give the brutes away."Similar movements were startedat other schools. Now, in that district, there are 622 boys who aremembers of the sheep club. Amongthem they own nearly 2,665 sheep.By tax returns, the dog populationappears to have increased also, butthe agent says this is not true. Formerly there was no sentiment for enforcement of the dog law, he says,but now there is a very strong sentiment, that way, and, while there hasbeen a considerable decrease in thenumber of dogs, there is an apparentincrease, because people who formerly evaded the dog tax now haveto pay it."Aetna-AutoCombination PoliciesProtect AgainstFireTheft&Collision -Property DamageLiabilityAnd OtherCasualtiesA.J.

Upper St., Lex.Mrs. L. V. Jones, PrincipalSERVICE IN BROADSENSE IS PLANNEDBY RURAL PROGRAMOld-Time "Country Parson" IsCentenary Survey EmphasizesThat Church Must Minister toAll Phases of Every Day Rural Life.Saving children from infantile paralysis, hogs from hog cholera andcrops from insect pests are "churchservices."So the new church, the regeneratedchurch of the reconstruction period,understands "service" in the ruraldistricts of America.The old-time "country parson" ispassing.In his stead comes the man whoknows what to do not only with aBible and a hymn book, but with apotato bug, a family quarrel, a badroad and a shortage of seed corn.The church as a factor in the social, political and economic life ofthe rural district; religion as practical as well as spiritual service, arenot experiments. The new churchand the new pastor have provedthemselves and found themselves atthe same time.Take the story of Lakeville,Holmes county, Ohio.Fresh from his theological studies,Charles M. McConnell went to Lakeville five years ago as pastor of theMethodist church there.McConnell was sent to Lakevillebecause the Methodist board of Sunday schools -chose it as the leastpromising "charge" they could find.And the board wanted to experimentThe new pastor found a moribundchurch and an epidemic of hog cholera. McConnell preached dynamicsermons. But he did not neglect tosend to the State University forcholera serum.Two members of the church metsome boys later, and conversationveered to the pastor. One was dubious about his theology."I don't know about his theology,"said the other, "but I do know thathe saved my hogs. I'm for him."An old church building was forsale at Killbuck, 22 miles away.McConnell hought it in at auctionfor $448, hauled it to Lakeville, andin December it was dedicated as theLakeville Memorial Hall, to the boysMETHODIST CENTENARYRURAL CHURCH PROGRAM.Better rural churches.'Establishment of effective training schools for rural church leadership: A nation-wide educational campaign to increase the efficiency ofthe ministry now In service.This is how the Methodistchurch proposes to rehabilitaterural churches in this giganticfive-year Centenary program.who went into service. This was thefirst rural memorial hall dedicatedanywhere In the United States.In the hall is a standard motionpicture outfit. McConnell and twoof his members bought it, projector,seats and all, for $1,100, on theirown responsibility. Pictures areshown every Saturday night.The farmers were losing moneythrough ignorance of modern agricultural methods. McConnell arranged with the State University fora series of farmers' institutes.The institutes were held in thechurch. Better orchards, better cattle, better crops, were the result.Through the country are the ruinsof abandoned rural churches. TheLakeville church flourishes. Butrural churches can not retain McConnell s at existing rural church salaries. That" is the Gordian knotwhich the Centenary program forAmerican rural communities isplanned to cut.In the next nv years nearly $11,000,000 of the $115,000,000 funds provided for in the .world, reconstructionprogram of the Methodist Centenarywill be spent to put such a man hjjevery rural center In-the country. ,Inthe Cincinnati area of the MethodistMissionary Centenary (Ohio, southern .Indiana and Kentucky) almostone-half million -will be spent by theCentenary out of the total of morethan two times that sum called forby the survey.TO AID VICTORY LOANMethodist Centenary .

This, will put at the disposal of the government the aid ofone of the greatest church organizations ever formed in America. Thechurch intensive drive will fellewfrom May. 18 to 25. 'U. S.

It would be unfortunate indeed if the people were to assumethat the banks are expected to absorb this last offering that marks theclose of the financial burden to behome by the American, people because of the world war.The financial situation, as well asthe business situation, is dependentupon, as wide a distribution as possible of the government borrowings.Every man should know that theprincipal functions of the banks arethose that they are now performing,purchasing the short time TreasuryCertificates of Indebtedness issuedby the Government in anticipation ofthe Fifth Liberty Loan.The proceeds of the Fifth LibertyLoan will come from the people andbe available for the payment of theseshort-time certificates of indebtedness, thus releasing bank funds forthe use of industry and agricultureand, perhaps, for a later use in. assisting the Government again inchasing future short time Treasurybills in case they should be offered.It is essential that the Chairmanof the Local War Loan Organizationsthroughout the, entire Eighth Federal Reserve District, and otherworkers connected with the organization, be familiar with and knowthe situation as it exists, and itshould serve to remind each LibertyLoan, worker that the general public be as fully informed and be asthoroughly convinced, as he is.The greatest misfortune that couldbefall this country, next to losing thewar, would be for Victory LibertyLoan to fail.GIRLS!

President Lincoln livedclose to the soil as a boy and believed firmly in the broadening effect ofliving rationally in the country. Hisviewpoint can be secured from thefollowing quotation:"No other occupation opens sowide a field for the profitable andagreeable combination of labor withcultivated thought as agriculture."I know of nothing so pleasant tothe mind as the discovery of anything that is at once new and valuable nothing that so lightens andsweetens toil as the hopeful pursuitof such discovery. And how vastand varied a field is 'agriculture forsuch discovery. The mind alreadytrained to thought in the countryschool, or high school, cannot fail tofind there an exhaustive source ofenjoyment. Every blade of grass is"astudy; and to produce two wherethere was but one is both a profitand a pleasure.India's jute acreage in 1918 wdsabout 9 per cent, less thon for 1917.Spring FootwearC'000 "&&z&Z?iIn Great.AbundanceJ rvttt st sz.x- - Watt-a,e'erNever in all our history have we been able tooffer such beautiful styles, so varied an assortmentFtNo one can tell what is going tohappen, but almost everybody canmake sure that a lot of things won'thappen.oBut. of course, the real old fond:friend of liquor win never , take tkindly to a piniyi.1hat'fdoesn't- kick'a 'little. . - : N-'- Jllat prices so far belowtheir regular value.
