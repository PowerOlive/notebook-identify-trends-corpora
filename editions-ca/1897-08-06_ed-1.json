In Officers Clothes She Relented aElt

The only bad feature of this thing

Colonel James A Sexton the former

ways want me to wear my regimentals
Its a thing I havent the courage to do

My- aversion to wearing a uniform
about in public dates from my boynood
days Upon that aversion is based an
early incident that may have had a
good deal to do with the course ofrny
subsequent life V
4I enlisted as a private at the outbreak
of the war being then a boy of17
rather mature looking however for
those years Like all boys of ftiatage
I was of a romantic turn but exceed-
ingly bashful in the presence of women
No parting in all that time of part- tlOn Ot the DUDllC
mg was more airecnng man was ours
when my regiment started for the front
When a year later I wassent back to
Chicago to recover from a wound in the
jaw I found myself as dear to her as
ever and she as dear to me it goes
without saying I was in the hospital
at Camp Douglas My wound healed
rapidly I was allowed to go about the
city very much as I chose and prayer
meetings with their escort privileges
claimed a great part of my attention -About
that time the Y M C Ai
was organizing a regiment to be com
posed exclusively of men who professed
religion The scheme naturally attract
ed a great deal of attention The papers
were full of it I was selected
one of the new regiments compa
nies Protest against the selection was
made on account of my age then just
18 The matter was carried up to the
adjutant general of tho state who final
ly decided in my favor My age the
singular character of the case and the
popularity of the regiment caused such
an amount of newspaper gossip that it
seemed as though everybody must have
heard of the matter at least All this
time I never wore my uniform outside
of camp The dear girl therefore nev
er saw me except in citizens clothes
Its an outrage she said just after
we met a very youthful looking man in
captains uniform on one of our walks
that such young men are trusted with
the responsibilities of command I dont
know what the country is coming to
For a moment I was overcome by
the shock When I recovered my breath
I told her that youth did not necessarily
debar a man from possession of the
qualities of a commander She declined
to be convinced and the conversation
became decidedly chilly Instead of
making my cuctomary call wrieli we
reached her house I stopped at the front
gate
Laura I said I must tell you
goodby My regiment has orders to
leave for the front tomorrow It may
be that we never shall see each other
again
But we did All fashionable Chicago
came to Camp Douglas the next day to
see the final dress parade of the much
talked of Y M C A regiment and I
could see the dear girl among the crowd
My new captains uniform gave me a
good deal of satisfaction just at that
time I can tell you The colonel of the
regirnent had asked me on account of
the power of my voice to act as adju
tant for the occasion That furnished
additional gratification The parade had
the magnificent splendor that only a
dress parade can have and the solemnity
of this occasion was vastly increased by
the reflection not to be dismissed that
many of those among regiment and spec
tators were seeing each other for the
last time on earth The band played as
though speaking our last farewell to
our friends Every one I am sure was
deeply impressed It was at t3 time
that the dear girl had her first and last
view of me in my captains uniform
Officers to the front and center 1
