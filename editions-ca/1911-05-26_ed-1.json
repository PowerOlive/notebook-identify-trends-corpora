The numbers were well rendered and
it can be safely said everything con
sidered it wss on of the best pro
crams ever rendered in the history of
the institution. This reflects great
credit on MiES Beat who is principal of
the musical department and who studi
ed for two years under the most emi
nent masters of Germany. It is her
first concert in the college and she is
the recipient of showers of congratu
lations. Tuesday morning beignuing at ten
o'clock the annual commencement was
held. . Twelve young ladies were given
their degrees, in addition to which
two young (ladies in music received
I their degrees. It was generally known
that Judge E. C. O'Rear, of the Ken
tucky Court of Appeals, was to de
liver the literary address. The large
audience began to assemble early and
by ten o'clock the spacious chapel was
filled to its utmost and the large halls
on the second floor were crowded. The
musical program was good and well
rendered.
Judge O'Rear delivered a masterly
address, free from oratory and lofty
nirrVitcs r1nin nnrl nrni'Mf-nl. vp full of
u"ft.i!:,iG Building; Tuesday, 'thought. The subject of his address
May b), w:ii) a. m.. Graduation Jixer
cises. Address to Graduates by Prof.
C. R. Mdelcher, Professor of German,
Kentucky State University, Lexing
ton. The exercises this year will ccnlpare
favorably with those in the past, not
withstanding the fsct that Col. and
"Mrs. Best have both suffered much
ickness during the winter but are
both well again. Amqng the interest
ing features connected wilh the pres
ent cemmencement i ill be the choral
c ass of cadets Sunday morning. The
Paris Military Band will furnish the
music Monday and will be met at the
S:41 train by the full M. M. 1. bat
talion and escorted to the grounds
.where tho competitive drill will take
place. Miss Bingham, a celebrated
.pianist, of the Cincinnati Conservatory
of Music, will render some good selec
tions at the play Monday evening.
The play itself is one of the best ever
put on by Mrs. Best. She will be as
sisted by Misses Julia Carpenter,
Martha Smith and Capt. Guy M. Rus
sell. Adimssion to this play will be
25 cents. Tickets go on sale Saturday
morning at the Waddell drug store.
Monday evening at eight o'clock the
annual concert of the M. F. 3. was
held in the college chapel. Notwith
standing the oppressive heat of the
evening and threatening weather the
.young ladies were greeted with a large
audience. The program-was in two
parts, classical and heavy, but as our
people are not only accustomed to
good music but enjoy the best the con-
was the "Rights of the Child," and
the trend of his argument was along
the deficiency of school work in Ken
lucky, revealing some remarkable cir
cumstances! He stated early in his
address that less than fifty per cent of
those of a school age between eight
and twenty years were in school. The
number of children in the statcof
these ages are eight hundred thousand
while only about three hundred thous
and are in schools. That the average
school house in the country districts
was an ill contrived unsightly build
ing, usually placed on a barren pice
of ground which was void of gras3
tree or flower and badly ventilated.
Another astounding feature of his
address was that should every child of
school age desire to go to school on
one day there are not enough school
buildings in the state, including our
colleges, seminaries and academics to
accommodate more than three-fourths
of them. At the close of the address
President Fisher presented the diplo
mas to the class of 1911 in an appro
priate address, after which he read
the honor roll. Miss Olive Fisher was
; frst and Miss Hazel Kerr second, both
of Millersburg.
At 12 o'clock the female college ad
journed to reopen on September 7,
thus closing one of the most success
ful years in the history of the institu
tion. One of the many remarkable
features connected with the opening
of next year is that the entire faculty
without a single exception have been
retained.
