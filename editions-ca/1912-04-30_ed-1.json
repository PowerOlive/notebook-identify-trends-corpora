Sanger's Circus May 2.
"Something out of the ordinary" is
a remark that can properly be made of
Sanger's Greater European Shows,
which will exhibit in Paris Thursday
May 2.
The big circus has a reputation for
producing remarkable surprises in its
arena until the public has learned that
it can attend an exhiDition of the
Sanger's Greater European Shows ex
pecting to see something new and
different.
. There is an unusual number of fea
tures withthis show this season. It
is difficult to pick the best, bomewill
like the trained wild beasts' exhibition
or horse wonders. , Others will prefer
the Earl Jbamily. Meredith Troupe,
The Riding Russells.the Glasgow Roy
al Horses, the Ellite Troupe, while
some Swill spend most of the time
laughing at the host of clowns, listen
ing to Luickey's famous Marine band,
enjoying the races, admiring"Lthe;ani
mals or petting the beautiful Dublin
Prize Horses." No matter which way
one looks while under any of the
Sanger's Greater European Show
tents, -he is sure to see something out
of the ordinary.

Times has the following about a Bour
bon county horse :
"Horsemen at the downs who came
from Charleston are discussing the fine
work of Sonanda. Catesby Woodford's
Kentucky Derby crack. Hie general
impression seems to be that when
Trainer McCormick ran the son of imp.
Star Shoot at Charleston he was a
little abort, and these good judges think
he will, be a strong contender with
Worth and The Manager for the big
race on May 11. Not a few of these
experts seem to be willing to wager
real money on Sonada's changes with
odds which look inviting."
