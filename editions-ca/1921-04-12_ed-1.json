The cinema
is declared to follow the text of the
original faithfully, taking up the
story when Huck and Tom Sawyer
discovered the robbers treasure in the
cave and following the adventures of
Huck through the efforts of Widow
Douglas to reform him to his abduc
tion by his no-account father and
subsequent encounters with the
broken-down actors, the "Duke" and
the "King."v As far as possible, the
inimitable flavor of Mark Twain has
been retained and it is said to be a
production of which the great hu
morist, were he living, would surely
approve.
The role of Huck Finn is in me
capable hands of Lewis Sargent, a
boy actor of unusual talent. Gordcn
Griffith plays Tom Sawyer and the
other performers in the large cast are
said to be thoroughly competent.
