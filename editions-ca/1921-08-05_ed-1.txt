I believe Paris is sadly in need ofa progressive administration, onewhh will carefully study the needsJf the city and the individual, andthe best and most economical way tocarry out those needs. The domination of political aspirants has foryears kept Paris from taking herplace among the foremost of CentralKentucky cities in progressiveness.-Local history will substantiate thatstatement. Personal gain has sacrificed civic pride to such an extentthat we today find ourselves in therut of indifference. The day has almost arrived for an opportunity toremedy those conditions and it restswith the voters of Paris to see if ourfuture aims shall be along the lineux progression or retrogression.COOPERATIVE TOBACCO -MARKETINGPLAN GAINING.T flollQTTO Vl-k nUJn .ff J.Jthe local papers show they have voters Twill go a towards giWngrealized it.

It has beensaid of me that if elected I would refuse to permit theexamination of the books of my predecessor, a statement soabsolutely false 'and ridiculous that it should be an insult toyour intelligence. The books of the Sheriff are public recordsand no man has the right or power to prevent their examination.They have recently been examined by expert accountants, theshortage ascertained and every dollar with interest must berepaid.A great deal has- been said about bonding deputies,which is only nmud-slingingfl in an indirect way, intendedto prejudice you against some of my supporters and indirectlyagainst me. I certainly approve of the bonding of all officials,but as the bonding of the Deputy Sheriff is only a protectionto the Sheriff I certainly do not feel that because Mr.JlcClintock was willing to trust his deputies without bond isgrounds for asking you to vote against me.Efforts have been made and are still being made toarray labor against me by circulating lies to the effect thatI am against the laboring man. My record will show that no manhas been more willing to render all the assistance possible tothe man who works, whether he be of the organized or unorganized class. I have never countenanced unfairness from eitheremployer or employee, and the honest, intelligent workman ofto-day asks 'only fair play.Attempts have been made to discredit my services onthe school board, a service which I have given without one centof compensation, and against which I challenge any man theright to utter one word of deserved criticism.Statements have been made that I would not attend tothe office if elected, but had already made promises of employment to others, all of which is absolutely false.v In issuing my warning I did not mention Mr. Bedford,but only referred to "tho.se opposing my nomination," and whileI am reliably informed that Mr. Bedford himself has usedas o'ne of his 'arguments to secure votes, some absolutely falseand ungentlemanly statements regarding my deputy, Mr. Gilkey, ,1hope I have been misinformed and that he has not been a partyto or given his consent to the above mentioned lies."In conclusion I-desire to state that this is -the ,4 first time I have ever offered for public office, if elected .,1 will do my duty as f see It.

This last letter was written after Mr. Redmon had gone toFrankfort and had a conference withthe State Tax Commission. Now,why did the Tax Commission changeits orders? Why did. they direcithat Mr. Redmon be retained? All because Mr. Redmon had agreed tocarry out the Tax Commission's instructions. Did not the Tax Commission demand that he increase theassessed value of farm lands in Bourbon county, for 1920, 10. per cent?Did they not threaten to have himfired, unless he agreed to complywith the orders? Did he not agreeto make this increase rather thanbe fired? If not why was he not removed? And why did he increasethe assessed value of Bourbon county, for 1920, from $31,000,000.00 tomore than $35,000,000.00, unless ordered to do so? xAnd if ordered todo so and he" complied with the orders, rather than be removed, why dothe voters of Bourbon county owehim anything for. what he did forthem?n A DEMOCRAT VOTER.(adv-lt)oDON'T BE CONFUSED LADIESTO VOTE FOR SHERIFF STAMPAFTERm. peale' collier xand you will have voted notonly for him but also forbob gilkey and doug thomasAS HIS DEPUTIES.

REDMON HASDONE FOR THE TAXPAYERS 'READ THE CORRES-PONDENCEAbout July 15, 1920, Mr. LeonSmith, Assistant to the State TaxCommission, came to the office of theTax Commissioner of Bourbon County, Kentucky, and said that we hadto raise allreal estate from 6 to 10cents, and' that transfers must beput in at -90 per cent, of their actualcost price. I fought this with allmy power because I thought ourpeople .were taxed high enough andas to transfers, 90 per cent, of theactual selling price was an injustice,because if a man paid $400 an acrefor a farm I was to take it at $360an acre for taxable purposes. Themanrthat did not sell right over thefence was in at $100 to $125 at theoutside. I told him I would not doit. He then said, "I will fire youfrom the office." The following .letters from the State Tax Commissioner will explain the rest:, STATE TAX COMMISSIONOF KENTUCKYFrankfort, July 23, 1920.Mr. Walter Clark,County Tax Commissioner,Paris, Ky.Dear Sir: We are just in receiptof a letter from our Assistant StateTax Commissioner, Mr. Leon Smith,in ivhich he reports to us that he hasvisited you and looked over the workin Bourbon County in regard to theassessment of property being madeunder your supervision at this time.'It is only fair to you to say thatMr. Smith says that in his opinionyou, personally, are undertaking todo your duty as County Tax Commissioner and assess the property asrequired under the law, but that yourDeputy, Mr. Redmon, persists in refusing to perform his duties in complying with the orders and rulingsof the State Tax Commission to havethe property assessed at a value notless than 90 per cent, of its actualcash value. From the informationobtained we are advised that Mr.Redmon, who is acting as your Deputy, refuses to increase a single person, regardless of what valuation thetaxpayer places thereon, but insiststhat he was intending to assess theproperty on the books just as it waslast year. You can imagine that weare very much surprised at the attitude of Mr. Redmon. He attendedthe conference of the County TaxCommissioners as being a gentlemanwho knew his duty, and had the courage to perform any duties devolvingupun mm as an oiiicial of this State.Based upon this information, snmpaction must be taken in the matterat once.We desire to call your attention toSection 2, Chapter 11, of the Acts of1918, whicn says:"Each County Tax Commissionerherein provided for may, with the approval of the State Tax Commission,appoint as many sober, discreet,capable persons not under the age oftwenty-one years, as deputies to assist him to discharge his duties, ashe may ceem necessary, and may remove them at his pleasure."P fr y reason, political orotherwise, Mr. Redmon is not dis-?fdix,.dohis whole duty on behalf of the State and the taxpayersof Bourbon County and assess theproperty of this county as requiredby Jaw,you should not have appointed him as a Deputy, and if you haveso appointed him, you should removehim at once.
