a-MHAi1ItJvroVgWWPWWIT PRESENTS ITS PLANMain Points in the Report of theMonetary Com missionPresents Wliat It Considers to lie Dofects in Our Present CurrencySystem and Suggests How ItMay Be ReformedWashington Jan 3 The followingis an abstract of the report of the monetary commission appointed under authority of the convention of businessmen held in Indianapolis last Januarywhich has just been made publicIt retains practically unchanged the existing metallic money The existing goldstandard on which business has been donesince 1879 is of course maintained on theground that industrial interests demandcertainty as to what the standard shall beFor the steady employment of labor factories and mines must be constantly operated and constant operation in the judgment of business men is impossible so longas there is uncertainty as to the standardon which prices of goods and orders arebased And to this end it is urged thatUie United States should remove all uncertainty as to the meaning of coin in itsobligations thereby saving the taxpayerby the ability to borrow at a lower rate ofinterestPlace for SilverNo attempt is made to remove the existing silver dollars nor to change theirlegal tender quality on the contrary aplaces is provided for them in the circulationby forbidding the issue of any paper moneyother than silver certificates in denominations below ten dollars The silver currency which will be in the hands of thepeople must be kept on a parity with goldas is now provided by law and this shouldbe done by requiring the treasury to givegold for a silver dollar on demand Consequently when it is known that a silverdollar can be exchanged for gold it willcirculate freely in the form of certificates and our metallic money without being diminished will be unified on a certainbasis And as all this silver currency willbe needed to meet the demands for largechange when other paper below ten dollars is retired it will not be presented forredemption at the treasury and it willcreate no strain on the gold reserves Butno more silver dollars should be coinedReserve Too SlenderThe commission contend that the ten different kinds of money now in use create ananomalous and confusing situation Moreover the whole fabric rests on too slender a reserve of gold It is urged that thedemand obligations of the governmentshould not be used as money because theymay be and have been presented for goldto the injury of the nations credit Thiscauses grave doubts as to the standard onwhich the business operations of the country rest Everything which by experiencecreates uncertainty and hurts tradehinders prosperity and should be removedHence the fiscal affairs of the treasury relating to the receipt and disbursement ofpublic revenues should be entirely separated from the monetary functions dealing with the exchange and redemption ofthe currency By establishing a separatedivision of issue and redemption in thetreasury it will be impossible to take awayfunds set apart for the protection of ourmonetary system and use them for currentexpendituresFraught with DangerAbove all it is regarded as dangerous tomaintain the present practice of using government demand obligations as money Ourfathers never made anything full legaltender money except gold and silver butin the stress of civil war confusing thefiscal and monetary functions of the stateforms of debt due on demand were used asiSmt V icsuii vl ueiiutu uuuii uuisworemergecy connmonqUtrnr rmamri III I IIsued exactlyJiisy yersIcause there were no resources in the treasury and so they depreciated drove out gold furnished afluctuating standard increased the national debt enormously caused a change inprices whenever the credit of the paperstandard fluctuated reduced the purchasing power of wages and bycausing unexpected changes in the level of pricesgave rise to extraordinary speculation increased the severity of commercial crisesand placed the small producer at a disadvantage with the large operator For 17years 1SC2 1S79 the government paper wasa falsified promise and our standard wasbased on this lie Trade and industry became speculative Men of large wealth cantake care of themselves but men of smallmeans should be protected from the evilsarising from such uncertainty of the standardIf the demand obligations of the government are used as money reserves must always be kept on hand to redeem themThey are not therefore a loan without interest and the expense of keeping upthese reserves has made the paper moneya very great burden to the taxpayer byan Increase of the public debt These goldreserves are necessary unless the government permits its notes to go to protest The mere credit of the United Statesbehind its notes is too vague a thing itspower to tax is too remote to provide cashon hand for instant use So far as expenseIs concerned this debt could have beanmore easily borne by changing it intolow interest bearing bondsShould Be WithdrawnFor these and other reasons the commission strongly urge the government towithdraw its demand obligations now usedas money decline to provide gold for exporters and put the burden and expense ofmaintaining a redeemable paper circulation upon the banks In order to meet thedemand obligations the present reservesof gold in the treasury furnish a beginningto be set aside in the division of issue andredemption and to meet possible contingencies the secretary of the treasury isauthorized to sell bonds whenever the reserves need replenishment In this wayor from surplus revenue the demand obligations that is United States notes andtreasury notes of 1S90 can be gradually removed and the cost to the country can bereduced while this process will also givethe inestimable advantage of ceasing touse demand debts as money of simplifying our currency and of adding to confidence in the certainty of our standardBy the plan of the commission governmentpaper is withdrawn in the first five yearsonly as fast as the banking currency expands so that contraction cannot possiblytake place if United States notes are canceled their place will be taken by the goldpaid out for them or by the expansion ofbank notes under the new system proposed and in the following five yearsall the remaining United States notes areto be retiredDank Note Is LandedThe demand obligations of the UnitedStates were put forth solely because therewere no funds in the treasury to redeemthem The notes were only evidence thatproperty had been received and used upfor services or supplies or public buildingsno longer available assets The government by the nature of the operation didnot retain as the notes went out anyproperty Immediately convertible into coinwith which to redeem its demand issues-They were not a money based on propertythey were only a debt On the other handa bank note is never issued fraud ofcourse excluded except for a considerationin negotiable property of equal or greatervalue The bank note comes forth as thesequel of a business transaction and I5based on the active property of the country which Is passing between producersand consumers This property Is alwaysnegotiable and always equal to the duty ofmeeting te note liability Bank notes areas sound es the business transactions ofthe country The currency of the countrymoreover should increase as the transactions of the country increase hence therigid unchanging Issues of the governmentmake them an inelastic part of the cirrgyqr yyVTiffiSgr7iculation while by the very process of their Iissue bank notes alone can be automaticallyadjusted to the changing transactions ofthe business communityThe Commissioners PlanIn view of the scarcity of United Statesbonds they cannot long be regarded as abasis for circulation Moreover any bondsecurity of a higher character yields a lowrate of interest and in time of stringencywhen borr6wers need loans and the market rate of interest is high there is noinducement to buy these bonds to increasecirculation Hence under the present system when notes would be most neededit is least profitable to issue them Whileproviding for a partial use of bonds forsecuring notes 25 per cent of the capitalthe commission proposed that notes beyond this should be issued on all instead ofa part of the resources of a bank and afterten years that no special bond securityshould be required Banks may issue notesup to 60 per cent of their capital withoutrestraint for issues beyond CO per centand up to SO per cent they pay a tax oftwo per cent for those bfeyond SO per centand up to 100 per cent they pay a tax ofsix per cent These notes would be aprior lien upon all the resources of thebank and in addition upon the stockholders liability Moreover all banks issuing notes contribute five per cent oftheir circulation as a permanent guarantyfund For daily redemptions banks shouldkeep a five per cent redemption fund in thehands of the comptroller of the currencyBanks of 325000 capital may be establishedin places of 4000 inhabitants and branchesof banks are also permittedSafe and Uniform CnrrencyIt Is apparent that the security to thenoteholder under the proposed plan isgreater than usually supposed If note3should be issued by all national banks tothe amount of SO per cent of their presentcapital the security in the form of totalassets omitting consideration of stockholders liability or a guaranty fund is morethan seven dollars to one dollar In the3276 banks outside the reserve cities theprotection would be 610 to one dollar ofnotes The greatest number of failuresof banks occurred In 1893 and yet the notesof these failed banks which did not realizeat least SO per cent of their capital out oftheir resources formed only one eighth ofone per cent of the proposed circulationHad SO per cent of the capital of all national banks been issued in notes upon theproposed plan since the beginning of thenational banking system in 1S63 an assessment upon the banks annually of onlyone fortieth of one per cent would havebeen necessary Moreover instead of atax on circulation a tax of one eighth ofone per cent on capital and surplus is proposed to cover the expenses of the systemSuch a plan in general would furnish asafe elastic uniform and expanding currency based on a fixed and certain standardChilds Prayer to SatanA Brixton clergyman vouches for thefollowing1 incident which he thinksis a touching instance of youthful orthodoxy He writes A little girl aboutnine years of age was obliged for sometime to endure the nagging annoyances of a maiden aunt The child puzzled her little mind as to the best meansof getting rid of her tormentor and atlast hit upon a plan which she thoughtwould have the desired result Shespent the whole of one morning writing a letter and having finished it shedisappeared in the garden In thecourse of the afternoon her motheraslcefl the gardener what Alice had beendoing and was surprised to learn thatshe had dug a deep hole and put a letter in it A search was made and thefollowing epistle was discovered addressed to the potentate of the netherregions at his official residjencejJTjgarMr Satan Will you kindly

insatiabledesire to look at choo choo cars andwhenever his papa could do so he wouldtake the little boy down to the track tosee the trains rush past One day anaughty fireman shoveled a lot of coalinto the furnace of a past ng locomotive and the wind blew a big blackcloud of smoke over toward Sunnylocks and some of it got into his eyesAfter that he would press his faceagainst his papas cheek whenever anengine rushed along because he didntlike the black smoke But as yet Sunnvlocks doesnt seem to have a verythorough understanding of the natureand composition of smoke The othernight when he was being carried upstairs to bed he pressed his faceagainst his papas cheek as he didwhenever he saw an engine Why areyou doing that he was asked Imust keep my eyes shut so de darkwont get in them

Early Attention AreThe Hawaiian Annexation Question theImmigration Hill the Financial Question and Mr Corbetts Claim to aSeat in the Senate From OregonWashington Jan 3 The prevailingopinion among senators is that verylittle legislation will be attemntedduring the present wreek The factcongress will not reconvene until Wednesday will probably be taken by theabsentees to mean that nothing willbe attempted until the following weekand as a consequence it is doubtfulwhether there will be a quorum present in the senate on Wednesday inwhich event there will probably be anearly adjournmtnt until the followingday and then an adjournment untilMonday In any event it is not probable that any important questions willbe raised during the present weekThe general understanding is however that the work of the session willbegin in real earnest after this weekand that henceforth there will be nojustification of the complaint of dullness of the proceedings Among thequestions which will engage early attention are The Hawaiian annexation question the claim of Mr orbett to a seat in the senate from Oregon the immigration biU and thefinancial question In all probabilitythe committee on privileges andelections will meet duringthe present week and thfechances are that an early report onthe Corbett case will be ordered eventhought it may not be favorable Therepublican side of the chamber willnot be a unit in Mr Corbetts interestSenator Burrows of the committeewhich has charge of - the case is preparing an exhaustive speech antagonistic to Mr Corbett and the oppositionare counting upon the assistance ofstill others from that side of the chamber It is not believed that there willbe any serious antagonism to the immigration bill but there may be considerable time consumed in speechesupon the subjectIt is probable that Senator Davischairman of the committee on foreignrelations will make an effort duringthe present week to get a day fixed fortaking up the annexation treaty andthere is no apprehension of any objection to naming a day in the early future The plan of the supportersof the treaty is to take thequestion up in executive sessionon a resolution of ratificationand to debate the treaty for a few daysin executive session pursuing thiscourse longv enough to determine theirstrength and commit those who profess to be with them If they find thatthey have the necessary two thirds tosecure ratification they will press onto the end but if thev discoverthemselves to be deficient injrojbnjejohipolicy and take up the question of annexation on Senater Morgans resoltvti on to that end There is no doubt thata majority of affirmatives votes can besecured and that a resolution of thischaracter can be passed if a vote canbe reached The present indicationsare that the treaty as such will fail ofratification by from two to six votesbut friends of the agreement have byno means lost hope that they will succeed in securing the entire GO votesnecessary to ratif3 They claim thatthey have been making headway in securing votes during the recess and arehopeful of still adding to the numberThe time of the house this week afKfrvrjrTHE BOUKBON NEWS TUESDAY JANUARY 4 1898ter it meets on Wednesday wiU probably be entirely devoted to the debateon the civil service question By general consen b the appropriation in thelegislative executive and judicial billfor the maintenance of the commissionupon which the debate will be basedwent over until after the holidays Itis intended by the opponents of thecivil service law that the debate shallcover the whole question and they expect to develope and exploit some veryinteresting factsTh defenders of the law have madeelaborate preparations to meet theseassaults and some highly interestingif not sensational incidents are anticipated The records of individuals arelikely to be very much in evidence Itis not expected that the debate will beconcluded this week as Saturday hasbeen set aside for paying tribute to thememory of the late RepresentativeWright of Massachusetts Gen Grosvenor of Ohio who has been one of themainstays of the opposition to the lawis very desirous of participating in thedebate but owing to the senatorialfight now in progress in Ohio he willprobably not be able to return untilnext week It is not believed thatthere will be any attempt to close thedebate before he has had an opportunity to make the elaborate speechwhich he has prepared JNb one seriously believes however that the upshot of the present debate will be thestriking out of the appropriation forthe commission This proposition cannot by any means command the fullstrength of the opposition the leadersof which think direct legislationshould be enacted to repeal or radically amend the law The debate therefore will simply be -in the nature oia general airing of the views of themembers of the house the only practical effect of which will be to placethem on record for the

mistakenYour nerves areIn excellent order thank you MrLivingston her voice betrayed forthe first time exicitement look Heis coming toI sprang to my feet and together weapproached the bed and bent inquiringly over the patient His eyelids twitchedconvulsively and then opened Theman was conscious At the same moment my ear caught the sound of a distinct creak in the passage My eyessought Miss NancysThat was what I heard just nowshe murmured Its nothing all thesewooden houses creakBurlington monopolized our attentionand no more was said The doctor hadleft instructions which were followedto the letter Miss Nancy supported thesick mans head while I with a teaspoon fed him slowly with preparedbouillon Burlington swallowed thebroth with difficulty and made no attempt to speak He was not violentand apparently was not in pain Wewaited patiently for his first wordsWhere am I he stammered whenthe broth was consumed and his headonce more upon the pillowWith friends I answeredFriends His voice was singularlyStrong and harsh I have no friends41 x rememuw iub uuve j uune boyHe attempted to move and groaneddeeplyMr Burlington you know me Ithink Hugo Livingston Let me entreat you to keep perfectly quiet Dontmove and dont talk I can give youa hypodermic injectioji but you arebejbter without it Thedoctorwillehere to morrow morning earlyHe nodded and closed his eyes Ofcourse further talking between Nancyand me was impossible We sat in silence through the watches of the nightperforming from time to time such offices as were requiredThe birds had begun to twitter theirmatins when the doctor drove up Hehad been attending a dying patientHe protested against Nancys vigil andpronounced the patient in no immediate dangerYou will please go to bed Miss Gerard or at any rate lie down I insistDemetrius will take your place and 1shall relieve Mr Livingston Perhapsyou will be kind enough to ask the Greekto come to me at once I expect thenurse in half an hourI glanced at my watch as Nancyobeyed It was ix oclock and thehousehold was already astir Demetrius I knew was no sluggard nolie abed He would answer the summons promptly and upon my immediate action might hang the life of BurlingtonDistracted by doubt I walked to thewindow and flung up the lower sashThe fresh air flooded the room with itcame the sounds and odors of springThe full throated meadow larks California has few singing birds had began their roulades to which the staccatonotes of the gulls and the myriad voicedchorus of frogs from the marshes eastof the sand dunes furnished a curiousand effective accompaniment Thescent of the violet heliotrope andjasmines hung lightly on the breezeThe lawn sparkled with dew Thelanceolate leaves of the eucalypti quivered against an opalescent sky Leaning out of the window my tired e3resrested upon the Pacific which wooedme to its embrace with a tender murmur of welcome For the multitude ofsea birds could prophesy that themackerel and sardines were in the bayThe cormorants were hard at workplunging with mighty splashes into thewater I caught now and again thegleam of a mackerel in their monstrousbeaks and noted idly the parasitessnapping up the morsels of fish carelessly dropped by their patrons Whata paradise To me a garden of Edenwith its tree of Knowledge of good andevil its serpent Its Eve and alas theangel with the flaming swordI falls to the lot of all sons of Adamto wander once down the enchantedglades of Eden How many recognizethe place too late when the gate isclosed against them foreverMy thoughts were jmt to flight by thesound of Nancys voice She beckonedeagerly from the passageAn extraordinary thing has happened she gasped Demetrius hasgone He never went to bed at all Andand he has taken Mark with himGone I ejaculated So the fellowhad turned tail His nerves at the critical moment had failedHe has left a letter for mamma Sheis reading it now I must go to herFlinging these disjointed xhrases atmy head she left me and I returnedthoughtfully to the bedside of Burlington As yet lie had sbown no disposition to talk The doctors secondexamination had provoked groans andaffirmative nods in response to important questions The man was terriblybruised but his bones mirabile dictuwrere still intact Quiet of course wasimperative and any excitement mightprove fatal I led the doctor to the window and told him briefly thatDemetrius had left the house Anything yen need doctor I can get Praycommand me The doctor howeverrefused my services and went himselfto prepare a liniment I accompaniedhim to the door and when I turned confronted the melancholy eyes of Burlington The fire was out of them inits place was a questionAm I in the house of Mark Gerardhe asked harshlyYou are in the house of Mrs Gerard I replied It was futile to evadethe truth but I wondered how he wouldtake itfHe took it as might be expectedhardly in silence The hot bloodflamed across his forehead and ebbedinstantly leaving the pale complexionlivid a danger signal which quickenedmy own pulses The situation was intensely dramatic His next- questionsurprised meIs the Greek hereHe was hereCurse him Dont let him come intothis roomHe closed his eyes and said no moreAfter all he had said enough Themere words coupled with the tones ofhis deep voice horrified me Manifestly his appetite for blood was not yetglutted And this man was the fatherof NancyAn hour later the letter of Demetriuswas placed in my hands I had finisheda hasty breakfast and was sitting-smoking upon the veranda The doctor and the nurse were with BurlingtonThe letter ran thusDear Madame Acting in accordancewith the instructions I received from mymaster I have been compelled to leave yourhouse and take your son with me We cancamp at the hut on tho island Mark haddescribed this hut to me with enthusiasmit had been built by his father and was wellprovisioned for the purposes of duck shooting and Mark as ycu know will besafe and happy there with me I dare nottake the chances of exposing the boy tothe fury of a powerful madman Yours respectfully madame DEMETRIUSNancy brought me this carefully written epistle and with it a message fromher mother Mrs Gerard was prostrated by the events of the past 24 hoursand unable to leave her room She approved the flight of DemetriusTHe is certainly faithful said MissNancyWhy are you not lying down Insked severelyI could not rest while while thethunder is in the air Mamma has justgiven me the key to the puzzle Shehas told me that Mr Burlington is amadman that h has a terrible grudgeagainst father and wishes to murderrbor Mark How horribleVery horrible I said gravelyAnd you she continued were sentdown to stand between Marfcand this- tjdreadful monster I did you an injustice Forgive meShe held out her hand frankly withan air of good fellowship which arguedthe lack of a tenderer sentimentBut the monster she continuedwith aslight shiver is surely helplessThat Miss Nancy we do not knowWe think soMamma also told me that he hadonce tried to murder father and instead had killed his partner 1 couldsee that the mere telling of the storyupset her terribly Oh Mr Livingstonmy heart misgives me when I think thatIm responsible for this man being hereWhat have I done in my folly and conceitHer distress was most painf ul to witness and naturally I offered somecrumbs of comfort pointing out thatshe had acted according to the dictatesof her heart a womans wisest counselor and doubtless for the best ultimateljWhy has this man she asked fiercely been suffered to heap such wretchedness upon the heads of innocent peopleI was silentHave you nothing to say she demanded hotlyThere is reason in everything Ianswered the inexorable logic ofcause and effect I believe that the answer to most of our questions may befound if wre search rjatientlv Theproblem of human suffering is to besolved but not by random guessworkThe sufferings of such a woman as yourmother are to be evidence of a futurestate of existenceShe listened attentively to my cruderesponse a softer light suffusing herfine eyes The thought struck me thatboth of us she as well as I had takenlife too lightly and needed the disciplineof reflection To me personally thingsin general had begun to assume strangeproportions some of my mountainsdwindled to mole hills and vice versasubstance melted into shadow the idealabsorbed the real The process is oftenrapid and like a trip across the Englishchannel most upsettingYesterday said Nancy after a significant pause I particularly noticedthe sunset The line of surf with thelight behind it was purpie not whiteand yet I knew of course that it waswhite It is so with the human soulswe meet their color depends upon thelight and our own eyes deceive usYou are right HushAnd there are always the two roadsone leading to Heaven on earth Imean and the other toThe land of regret May you neverset foot thereI spoke warmlyThank you you wouldTurn myself into a sign post foryour sake Most assuredlyWe gazed calmly and dispassionatelyinto each others eyes Perhaps all inall it was the bitterest moment of mylife for I saw that she had guessed mysecret and remained unmoved and yetthe leaven of sweetness was thereCHAPTER VIAt the request of Mrs Gerard I drovealone to meet her husband a passenger on the incoming stage which wasdue at the nearest town a wretchedvillage about five in the afternoonBurlington so the doctor assured mewas practically speaking paratyzedand unable to move his limbs withoutsuffering intense pain During the dayhe had spoken to none taking whatnourishment was offered and submitting without a groan to the treatmentprescribed The nurse was a powerfulman fully awake to his responsibilitiesGerard doubtless had much to say to meand I to him Under these circumstances I consented to leave the houseWill he live was the first questionof GerardJThe doctor thinks soThen I told my story from start tofinish eliminating The murderous suggestion of the Greek Gerard was inrtensely excitedGood Lord he burst out what anescape the lad has hadI concluded with the flight of Demetrius and gave him the Greeks letterwhich he read rapidly and placed in hispocketbookWell he said sharply in the toneof a man who is puzzled but wont admitit well sir what is your opinionMind your honest opinionDemetrius said I slowly searching for a suitable epithet and selectingthe one upon my tongues tip is adamned cowardAnd your reasons he snappedHis restless ejes sparkled as the adjective sputtered from my lipsHe turned tail to save nis own hideThe boy was taken to save appearances 1When Mark was in real danger aloneon the sands with Burlington Demetrius was indecently indifferent Butwhen the doctor apprehended violentsymptoms and our friend thought thathe might be exposed to them whythenHe wilted ehYes the naked coward obtruded itselfYou dont know him young manPossibly notuHe is no coward I have known Demetrius for 30 years a long time Irepeat he is no cowardI touched up the horses with theflick of the whip and the action betrayed me for Gerard laughedTake it coolly he said Youngmen nine times out of ten misconstruethe motives which govern human actions Remember that I have made astudy a profitable stud y of my fellowcreaturesAll the same I said doggedly heis a cowardThats quite right Stick to yourcolors my boy By the way I am surprised that you should have taken Burlington to m3 houseI could not excuse myself without accusing Nancy so I held my peaceHowever he continued thoughtfully we have the man where we canwatch him You may yet earn that bigsafaryI expect to I retorted bluntly Iwas cursing myself for speaking outso plainly In damning the cowardiceof the Greek I had also by inferencedamned the cowardice of my employerTO BE CONTINUEDAN INTERESTING WRECKDiscovery of an Old Frjgate in theRoadstead of BrestThe recent discovery of the oldwreck of a frigate or war vessel at thebottom of the roadstead of Brest haiincited research both on the part ofscientists and historians One of thelatter recently declared that the vesselmust have been sunk by the Spanishguns from the Fort de la Pointe Thisview however is doubted bj a navyofficer who has searched the archivesand considers it improbable that theSpanish guns of that time should havebeen able to sink a vessel on the northside of the roadstead the distance beiAg altogether too great He thinksthat the wreck is that of a vessel fromtie fleet of the duke de Vendome whoin 1652 after the naval battle in frontof La Bochelle touched at Brest beforecoming to the

devoted to matters relating toRoentgen radiations was addressed atits first meeting in London by ProfSilvanus Thompson its president whoread a paper giving a resume of theprogress in the art The English custom that might well be followedin America of supplementing lecturesand papers by an exhibition of the allied apparatus was followed by thissociety the exhibition being repletewith everything pertaining to the invisible rajs Prof Thompson pointedout the fact that while numerous theories had been advanced to explainRoentgen rays none had received experimental demonstration and he saidwe are as much in the dark regardingtheir exact nature as at the time oftheir discover in November 1S95 Thegreat advance made has been in the development of the rays in the tubes fortheir generation in the controlling devices and the manipulation of the current for actuating the tubes Now aradiograph can be obtained in a secondivhile at first an exposure of half anhour was usual One of the exhibits illustrating this advance was a full sizedhuman figure five feet four incheshigh taken with a single exposure of afew minutes It redounds to the creditof American workers that this sciagraph was made by Dr Morton of NewYork city Another important advancethat- has been made is in the photographing of the soft tissues of thebodj though there is still room for improvement in this

OwneIJACKS PRIZEnt sBY CAPTAIN DUNLOPan oeww9JBggg6Jack Furnival decided toWHENride over to the Fairfields oa hisbicycle sending- his luggage in advanceby train he did not imagine that thejourney would occupy so short a timeSir William Fairfield was commander-in-chiefof the Mid Thames districtLady Fairfield was a beauty and considerably younger than her lord JackFurnival had made her acquaintancein the preceding season They had bothbeen of the party which Lord Clandevere had driven down to the lunch atKanelagh after a meet of the Four-in-Handclub She had sat next to Jack atlunch He had found her lively Illnatured people said that she was toolively and that when Fairfield held thecommand at Cyprus a high dignitaryof the Persian empire who happened tovisit the island on his way to Constantinople had been very much amazed nottc say scandalized by miladis behaviorJack specially remembered the dayfor another reason It was during await before the start for the coachingcompetition A girl who was standinga little in front of him suddenly detached herself from the general crowdby a hasty movement and an impatientexclamation flung- over herwards himWhat a time they are When do youthink they are going to begin JackThe individual thus addressed lookedat her with amazement and interest Itwas a wonderfully pretty and piquantprofile which offered itself in this abrupt fashion to his notice The featureswere clear cut and yet inexpressiblysoft in outline The eyes were largeand luminous the hair glossy darkand abundant tlhe complexion warmand rich in coloring She had the prettiest short upper lip in the world whichwas at that moment curled up in amost enticing pout expressive of the utmost discontent and impatience Hescrutinized her with attention Shehad moved half towards him with themost simple and familiar manner in theworld and addressed him by his Christian name Yet her face was quite oinIcnown to himJack you dear old goose she continued turning right round to himThen a look of consternation came intoher face Oh 1 beg your pardon shecried I thought and then shet slipped awaySHiiB interfered withthe rest of the day He was guiltily conscious at intervals that the pearls ofconversation which the ladies of hisparty flung before him were whollywasted and that his interest in thedriving was frequently interruptedowing to his pursuit through dreamland of the face which had fascinatedhim at the first glance Once again during the day he caught a glimpse of hisunknown enchantress as she and herparty passed among the tea tablesTheir eyes met for a moment but herglance passed so rapidly away that itwas only by her rising color that heknew that he was recognizedSince that day he had seen nuuch ofLady Fairfield nothing of the unknown That is what the Mohammedans call Kismet Jack characterizedit in language which did not breathe somuch resignationThe Fairfields had a house on theriver in the Windsor district and thiswas Jacks destination He had intended to arrive at the usual hour butas nothing happened- to delay him onthe road his advent was rather in advance of his intentionThe butler told him that the partywere out his luggage had arrived andwould he take anj refreshment Whenthe preliminaries were over he loungedinto the drawing room intending to gointo the garden and down the riverIn the drawing room hewasconfronted suddenly by the unexpected figure of a pretty fair girl in shortfrocks and witli masses of yellowhair flowing down her back whopossessed the peculiar propertyof looking- childish forher age and at the same time rather tooold for her dress Unkind people wouldno doubt have said that the frocks werecurtailed in order that her mammasau mi lit not beTlow do you do said this apparition with much dignity I suppose jouare Mr Furnival I am Miss FairfieldJack had never hear of Miss Fairfieldbefore but he grasped the situation andalso her extended handMamma is out continued MissFairfield with easy nonchalance which wasiirther belied by the retreat of herhands to behind her backthey were determined toany further responsibilityma is out but I am homeas ifavoidMamI saveorders that if anyone came they were tosaw that Miss Fairfield was at homeDid Buckle mention thatXo I dont think he did repliedJack Furnival with preternatural gravity Perhaps he forgotBut servants ought not to forgpetprotested Miss Fairfield tossing backher long hair with a decidedly brownbut exquisitely shaped little handThats what I object to Wouldntyou After all when mamma is awayI am mistress of the house you knowOf course replied Jack symiheticailyMamma and the rest went boatingI didnt go I had some importantto attend to Have you ever beenNo replied Jack marveling- some 1what at the abrupt- dive into purely personal mattersOh of course it does not really signify and perhaps you might not like itbut its a pity You see mamma saysthat no lady can be considered realty refined unless she knows all about geography and kings of England and CaptEgerton says that when people arc inlove they talk about geography all thetime And so I asked Sir Harry Folmash who is in love with Miss Dale ifhe could bound Alaska and he said thatI had come to the wrong shop but thatif I went to Mr Fitz Eobins he wonld beable to do it for he was a first classbounder Why do you laurhA slight cold replied Jack makesme cough in that wayHadnt you better take something forit inquired Miss Fairfield anxiouslymaking her blue ejes very round in hereagerness Tea or a whisky and sodasomething that I could ring Buckle upfor He would have to bring it if youwanted itIt was no doubt part of the generalconspiracy against the mistress of thehouse that when Buckle was rung- uphe seemed disposed to put a slur on MissFairfields authority by appealing directly to Jack Furnival for confirmation of her orders The mistress of thehouse preferred not to notice thisHe had to obey she cried gleefullyDid you see I think I will be friendswith you she added evidently reflecting on Jacks share in the victory Ilike you I think you are nicer thanCapt EgertonAre you friends with Capt EgertonthenOh no Hes friends with mammaof course I make a point of never interfering with mamma It would notbe fairHow do you know that Sir Harryis in love with MissDale said Jack hastily changing thesubjectBecause he is going- to marry hermamma says She told Capt Egertonthat and said she hoped the partywould nair off nicely I wonder nowlite enWith this enlightenmentthe disagreeable remembrance that shewas going to marry Sir Harry FolmashIt seemed moreover as if Jack were expected to pair off with Lady CaroShe was allotted to him to take in to dinner Slu appeared to be quite ready- tofulfill her share of the drama and hesoon realized that if he were preparedto do likewise he would have a far fromdull time She was clever sympathetic brilliant He knew also that somepeople considered a pale mauve complexion relieved by lips of the color ofred sealing wax lighted by great flashing dark eyes which were accentuatedby thick lashes and darkened eyelidsthe whole set in a frame of raven blackhair constituted a very alluring toutensembleHis heart however went out on thefurther side of him where sat the littleKanelagh beauty She however wasnot by any means inclined to be so complaisant as Lady Caro Her replies werecurt He failed to draw her out entirely Yet he could hear that she talkedaway mei rily to Sir Harry Folmash Bysheer force of reaction Jack wasrhown more and more into the influenceof Lady Caro She was experienced inthese matters and became confidentialin a very short time which is inevtable if any progress is to be made ina short time Jack soon learnedthat she was a widow and that herlate husband had not been exactly anangel in her eyes that sihe preferredthe society of men to that of her ownsex and that she had no very higihopinion of the other men of the party -Alsohe guessed thatshemightbeaboutNtlhirtyAt the end of three days he had quiteunintentionally become very intimatewith Lady Caro She for her toldhim very plainly that if she ever married again it would be a man she lovedand that she would not care whether hewere younger than her or had no money at all This flattering avowal sofrightened Jack that lie would haveended his visit but thatOn theother hand he had made noadvance with Miss Dale - She was poTHE BOTJKBON NEWS TUESDAY JANUARY 4 1898whether you would ever guess whomyou are to pair off withAt that moment fortunatery or unfortunately the sound of voices in thehall announced the return of the partywhereupon Miss Fairfield without waiting to explain further darted out tomeet themSo you have been making friendswith vaj little girl I hope she did notbore you said Lady FairfieldSo inconsiderate of mamma wasMiss Fairfields subsequent criticism toher new found friend beforestrangersA newcomer is always under certaindisadvantages in a house party in thathe doesnt know the established flirtations or the recognized jokes On theother hand he has the advantage of novelty on his side and in the course of hisexplorations may upset even the mostancient institutions by appealing to thefeminine love ofchamgeThere were four ladies to choosefrom not counting Lady Fairfieldwho if he mig ht judge from her daughters remarks would be squired by CaptEgerton There was Lady Caro aplump beauty of a singularly foreignand meritricious kind Miss Maxwell amodern young giantess with auburnhair who had just missed being exceedingly handsome Mrs Phrine Hayson amarried sister and the dark counterpart of Lady Fairfield and Miss Dalewho had gone upstairsWhen Jack Furnival came down todinner he heard sounds of soft musicin the drawing room They ceasedhowever at his entrance and the performer rose hurriedly from the piamoAt the sight of her Jacks pulse throbbedviolently for he recognized the facewhich had haunted him since the dar ofthe coaching coimpetition at RanelaghIt appeared that her name was MissDale cameremaining in the hope that the icebergwould melt It had shown no sign ofdoing so as yetOn the fourth day there was to be aroad race on bicycles to the statue ofGeorge III on Snow Hill in WindsorGreat Park and back It was to be ago-as-you-please-race the only condition being that the park must be entered by the Englefield Green gate andmust be left by the Bishop gate LadyFairfield proposed to drive over withher sister and Lady Caro all of themdeclining to compete to Snow Hill tosee the racers pass and present themwith badges as a token that they hadfulfilled the conditionsThe ladies who amounted to half adozen were given time starts MissDale being scratch for them but stilla long way ahead of the men who werehandicarmed dn three divisions Thereis only space to hint how Jack Furnival starting at scratch graduallyoutrode the men all but Capt Egertoncaught up the ladies all but Miss Daleand ran through them reached thestatue still level with the captainpassed him by riding up a hill whichproved too much for him came levelwith Miss Dale about a mile from thepark and thenOh its you cried Miss DaleWell I suppose you will win now and1 thought I was going to Well youshant have it without a fight Shequickened her pace Jack did thesame but without attempting to passher They kept on for a few minutesand then she slackened again I cantgo on like that she panted you aretoo strong for me Xo never mind meas he drew alongside of her go on andwinI dont care a rap about winningsaid Jack moodily and there isnobody who cares a rap whether I do ornotXot Lady Caro inquired MissDale in a tone that was oddly compounded of archness and bitternessLady Caro does not care two strawsabout me and I dont care two strawswhether she does or notO fti Why theymindYes but I do mindsay0said XeverWhat did theyWell I am sure its no business ofmine they said if you must knowthat you were going to marry her andit really looked like it always sittingin her pocketThey seem to have rather a way ofsaying things about people said Jackwith much annoyance Then carrying the war into the enemys countryOddly enougn that was the first thing1I heard about youWhat wasThat you were going to bemarriedIndeed The very idea And whomto praySir Henry FolmashOh yes I see I suppose they toldyou Miss Dale But thats my sister Isee now And so you thought thatwhen Sir Harry and I wrere boringeach other for civilitys sake exactlyHer clear laughter rang out like a pealof bellsAnd was that the reason youwould never condescend to speak to apoor person who had never done youany harmOf course that is I mean to saystammered Miss Dale flushing suddenly a beautiful carmine which could notbe wholly accounted for by the exercise she was talcing I mean ofcourse I thought you must be horridif you were going to marry such awomanIsnt it rather unfair to condemn aman without trial especially when hehappens to be innocentAt this Miss Dale laughed and said Ithat people shouldnt take so muchtrouble to look guiltyAfter this they rode on side by sideconversing most amicably precisely asif they were merely taking a countryride instead of struggling for the finish of the raceAbout a quarter of a mile from homeJack uttered an exclamationMy left pedals got loose he exclaimed Luckily I can ride with onefoot Now I will race with you withone footofferMiss Dale had forgotten all about therace but she jumped at the proposalShe put on speed and as might naturally be expected soon distanced theother In the excitement of the moment she had reached the house andbecome entitled to the prize before sherealized that Jack had deliberatelythrown the race away to her perhapshad fabricated tne defalcation of thepedal altogetherMrs Jack Furnival used to say inafter years that the real reason why shemarried her husband was that she felthe had really a right to that prize andit was the only way by which the injustice could be repaired

cheap fiveand ten cent novelties tnd the betterclass of mechanical toys such as riversteamboats locomotives trains trolleycars dolls that walk and talk and animals that move about almost naturally are made in America while suchold fashioned playthings as buildingblocks tin soldiers wooden sheep skincovered horses cows and dogs all ofwhich judging- from the numeroussales are as great favorites wTith thechildren of to day as they were a generation or two ago come mostly fromGermany In that country these toysare hand made by peasants who workat them at night or during dull seasonson the vineyards or farms Labor ischeap and although the designing isseldom original the workmanship iausually good and the toy can beimported and sold cheaper here thanthe same class of goods made in thiscountry As a result of this there aremany toys which in their completedstate are partly American and partlyforeign Among these are toy vehicleswith horses or oxen attached The vehicles and everything in and aboutthem may be the product of Americanmachinery while the animals standingin front of the toy may be from GermanyAre many American toys patentedYes the most expensive and insignificant novelties are

llanMeatA young woman in the north part oithe city was told ten years ago thashe had consumption and that unlessshe went to another climate she wouldnot ive many years Her parents werunable to send her to another climateand another physician about that timeadvised her to eat raw meat in the hopeof prolonging her life In less thanthree years she was in apparent goodhealth The eating of raw meat has eiCected a cureWhen once it has been formed theraw meat habit is as bad as any otherand when the young woman had regained her health she found that shewas still addicted to the eating of rawmeat She still has the habit As longas she lived at home with her parentsshe could eat the uncookedi food asoften as she pleased Her parentsmoved away a few months ago andthe daughter went to board with somfriends in another part of the cityThey did not know that she was addicted to the eating of raw meatEvery now and then her appetiteovercame her and she longed for a rarebeefsteak The desire for it became sostrong that she would go into thekitchen and pinch off pieces of thebeefsteak that had been purchased forthe next meal The woman with whomshe boarded began to complain of micesShe said they had never been in thekitchen before and began to wonderhow they got in At last she boughta trap and placing the beefsteak ona high shelf out of their reach shebated the trap and set itThe trap never caught a mouse andthe beefsteak was nibbled nearly everynight It was thrown away the nextmorning because the woman said shewould not cook meat after mice hadieaten from it She wondered how themice could get upon the shelf and whythey never attempted to eat the steakwith which the trap was baitedAt last the girl heard of the mysteryin the kitchen and confessed She admitted everything and now she hasall the beefsteak she can eat and themice are never suspected St JosephNewsDINNER IS READYTlie Announcement as Conveyed byMrs Iiion to Her SpouseI happened to be standing in cfront cia lions cage the other day about fouroclock Mr Lion was sound asleep ina corner his countenance expressiveof happy repose while one huge pawwas supporting the tawny head thatseemed as innocent as a lambs Helooked amazingly like one of the sevensleepers Opposite was Mrs Lion stepping about like a huge pussy cat nowglancing at her sleeping lord thenwhisking- her tail impatiently but withwifely consideration not doing a thingthat could disturb his siesta Back andforth she marched and it seemed as ifher rhythmic tread- was a sort of savage lullabA for the beast in the cornerscarcely breathed under its spell Suddenly she stopped beside him her noseonh a few inches from his ear but hergleaming ejes were turned far awayIt was only a second but her sleepingcompanion lifted his head and peeredin the same direction then he boundedto his feet All was changed The Icingof beasts was every inch a king Withquivering nostrils and head erect hegazed with all his eager might Whatwas it What had she told him Andthen the two danced that figure of aquadrille the familiar partners crossover Round and round- back andforth till I fairly dizzy watching theunceasing motions of their bodiesturnedabout to find it was feeding timeThe watching lady had simply announced that dinner was servedPoor things they did not get theirshare until the very last and meanwhile they kept up the eternal partners cross over expectation and hunger making them perfectly obliviousto the sympathy that was being offeredby a curious spectator The couple ofpounds of raw meat actually meltedin Mr Lions mouth but Mrs Lion tooklonger to masticate her portion and Iam sorry to relate she did not show thatconsideration for her old mans feelings which made me admire her somuch at first She now turned herback on him and devoured the tidbitfar away in a corner of the cage growling fiercely whenever he moved It isfeared she is like many others of hersex and lacks the charm of a confidingnature Boston Heraldj A Serfs
