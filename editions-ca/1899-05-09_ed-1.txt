regarding thecombination of all the large steel companies in the country and made the assertion that the deal was as far reaching as the ingenuity of the minds thatconceived it could possibly make itMr Gates has just returned fromNew York where a recent meeting ofthe steel magnates was held for thepurpose of arranging the details Thepresident of the American Steel andWire Co said that all the difficulties inthe way of the combination had beenremoved and that the financing of thegreat combine which will control theentire steel industry of the countryhas been successfully carried to a conclusionThe headquarters of the new company will be in New YTork and according to Mr Gates the capital stockwill be between 8500000000 and 800000000 and he coolly remarked thatthe figure might reach 1000000000The president of the new companj heremarked would be H C Frick ofPittsburgh who has been so closelyidentified with Andrew Carnegie Regarding the other officers he professedignoranceNot the least interesting phase ofthe deal will be the complete retirement of Mr Carnegie from the steelindustry and the placing of his mantleupon the shoulders of Mr Frick Inspeaking of this Mr Gates said thatMr Carnegie would possibly not haveany interest in the new concern provided the terms he proposed to thecombination were accepted And Isuppose they have been he concludedelse the combine would not now bean assured factMr Gates company the Americansteel and wire was one of two concerns that held out against the combine until recently The other is saidto have been the Federal Steel CoWhen asked about this Mr Gates saidthe difficulty was really a small oneand intimated that is was a matter ofprice The company will be ready foroperations by July 1 when if presentplans are followed offices will beopened Mr Gates objects to havingit called a trust and maintains thatnot a single element of a trust entersContinuing Mr Gates said This issimply a combination of all the bigsteel companies into one concernwhich purchases the various plantsoutright at figures that have beenagreed upon and accepted It will bea splendid thing for the industry andthe concern will begin business aboutJuly 1 at New York with Mr Frick aspresident As to the capital stock Ican not say definitely but it will beover 500000000 and may reach twicethat sumTWO RADICAL BILLS PENDINGVoters in Alabama Must Be Able to Readthe Constitution School RevenuesDerived From TaxesMontgomery Ala May 6 Thehouse Friday morning laid upon thetable by a vote of 50 to 2S a motionto reconsider the vote by which thebill which seeks to repeal the constitutional convention act was passedFriday It will pass that body byan easy majority Monday Thehouse is now considering twoimportant amendments to theconstitution both in the interestof the white citizen One seeks to require that all voters must be able toread understandingly any portion ofthe constitution of the state but provided that the provision shall not extend to any citizen whose antecedentsprior to 1861 enjojred the privilege ofsuffrage This provision is intendedto preserve to the ignorant white voternis right to participate in electionsThe other bill seeks to apply theschool revenues derived from taxes onproperty belonging to white men tothe education of white children andthose derived from the colored manstaxes to the education of the Negrochildren As it is the school fundsare distributed equally without regardto race although the whites pay practically ail of the taxes The indications appear to be that both of thesebills will pass The franchise

American Philippinecommission have formally admittedthe sovereignty of the United Statesover the Philippine archipelagoFrom a member of the cabinet it hlearned that this admission was made tcPresident Schurman at a conferenctheld by him with Col Arguelles ancLieut Bernal several days ago It was irreply to a direct question put to them bjMr Schurman and the character of thtanswer was no doubt as gratifying tcthe commission as it is to the presidentAs a result of the dispatch sent bjMr Schurman it is the confident expectation of the president that the encof the rebellion is close at hand Thisresult will not be obtained withoulconcessions which have been recommended by the commission and whichby direction of the president will higranted These concessions contemplated giving to the Filipionos a forrcof government modelled after that olthe United StatesThe member of the cabinet wittwhom the correspondent talked saicthat the commission had unanimouslyadopted a recommendation which wassubmitted to the president in MrSchurmans dispatch providing threedepartments for the government of thearchipelago first the executive department second the legislative department and third the judicial departmentThe executive department as recommended by the commission is to consist of a governor general who shallJACOB GOUID SCHURMANPresident of the United States PhilippineCommissionhave absolute veto power over anyacts of the legislature and his cabinetformed of leaders among the Filipinosand Americans The legislative department will be organized as a resultof the granting of suffrage to the Filipinos having property qualificationThe president will be empowered toappoint the members of the judiciarymst as he will be empowered to appoint the governor generalWhat the cabinet officer regarded asthe best feature of the whole matterwas the acceptance of the commissionsproposition by the Filipiono envo3TsIt was learned that before the submission of this proposition to them theyhad asserted that they did not represent Gen Luna but AguinaldoIt is believed the presentation of thecommissions proposition was in compliance with the request of the Filipinos who desired to know what thepromises made by the United Statesreally meant The first propositionmade by them to the commission wasfor an armistice during which the Filipinos proposed to call together theircongress and througli that body arrange for peaceThe proposition was refused withoutconsideration It was then admittedthe cabinet officer said that the Filipino army was too weak to standagainst the American force which wasgreatly its superior Aguinaldo theenvoys declared is not fighting for theindependence of the country so muchas for the honor of the array and theythought it humiliating that theyshould be compelled to lay down theirarms without first understanding whatthe United States proposed to doIf the United States persisted inoverriding the Filipinos by force ColArguelles declared the natives wouldretreat to the mountains and wouldcontinue for 3 ears a guerilla warfarewhich would be to the great injury ofthe United StatesMr Schurmans communication madea deep impression upon the

the difficultiesthereThe reply of the president to ProfSchurmans cablegram it is xinderstood stated that he was very anxiousto have the peace negotiations concluded at the earliest possible momentand to this end he desired that no unnecessary or humiliating conditionsshould be imposed upon the insurgents It is believed in administration circles that as soon as Aguinaldo is convinced of the

people themselvesGen Kennedy saysThere can scarcely be found uponthe globs a more hospitable and warmhearted people than those of PorteRico They are in full sympathy withAmerican institutions There is agreat deal of poverty in the island asit is understood in the Lnited StatesThat is the people live in flimsily constructeel huts have few clothes andstill less of ready money but owing tcthe bounty of nature around themthey can live with little work and fewworldly gooels and still not suffer fromeither cold or hunger The stories oistarvation upon the island are fabricationsWhile the richer classes live well inbeautifully appointed homes and havebeen for the most part educatedabroad so that they speak English thepercent of illiteracy among the poorerclasses is very high reaching 90 percent but this is largely due to thefact that there are no schools worththe name outside of the largest townsor indeed one might say in the wholeislandAs to agricultural opportunities 1should say that not one fourth of thelands in the islands are now under cultivation and thousands of acres yetremain to be given over to husbandryLands are held at a good price owingto the promise of an influx

the sharpsudden rise of fee great rock itselfAt this point we could not but wonderat the desperate valor of Brodelysmen for from here to the summit theonly regular a eent was by a flight ofnarrow rock hewn stairs and thechance for placing sealing ladders wasof the worst and riskiest Vet up herethey had won their way and the fragments of some of the ladders andmore than that a stain of blood hereand there still remained as witnessesto itAt the top of the stairs was a largesquare building that we afterwardfound was designed to hold militarystores and from here a straight walkied to a narrow deep chasm the eastleitself lyinsr on the other side Therehad been a bridge here but the Spaniards in their final defense had destroyed it and In its place was now arude affair of planks partly supportedby guy On the other side was a kindof barbican and ihen the wall of thecastle proper The structure was ofno great sie rising merely in a smalltower or keep and thence stretchingout in two short low wings By thistime the sun wis pouring down fiercely and as we had explored the greater part of the place we concluded toseek a more comfortable spot and accordingly descended the hill againThe excursion had afforded tis muchpleasure besides letting us into theknowledge of things that it was profitable for tis to know More than allperhaps it gave us the assurance ofthe desperate and seemingly resistlessralor of our present comradesTt was not long after we had returned to the bottom of the hill thatwe met five or six of the garrison andwith them a sturdy middle aged manwho turned out to be the hero of thelate battle Capt Hrodely He wasbusy just then in giving some ordersabout the strengthening of the breastworks and we merely got a short nodfrotn him in exchange for our salutethough this proved to be but the beginning of our acquaintance I can nowcompass the events of two weeks ormore into a very brief space My companions and I biassed most of the timeashore and though we did not seemto slight our shipmates took care tohave as little of their rough and unacceptable company as possibleBut these small things soon passedout of our thoughts for one morningCapt Morgans fleet was sighted Ina moment there was the liveliest sortof stir and excitement Flags weretaken from the ships and hoisted onthe castle and forts and the guns weremade ready to fire salutes Everyonefurbished up his arms and harness andthe ships were cleaned and made trigAt first the wind was contrary butfinally one crait and then anotherbeat its way in and before nightfall allhad fetched the mouth of the riverHere a rather serious misfortune happened for what with our rejoicingand their own pleasure and tumultthe people of the first four of the shipssteered upon the dangerous sunkenrock and their crafts were wreckedThe north wind coming on to blowcompleted the mishap and it was onlyby considerable exertion that all themen and contents of the ships werelanded the vessels themselves beinghopelessly wrecked At last CaptMorgan himself stepped on shore having till now stuck to his ship and atonce our men broke out in a greatcheer and rushing down caught himj up and placed him on their shouldersand bore him up to the eastlei AI Teontpanion and 1 tell into tnewake of the crowd and continued on tothe castle where at last the pantingand shouting buccaneers set Morgandown At the same time a final saluteof all the cannon about the place waslet off Morgan removed his headpiecegiving a flourish of acknowledgmentand in 0 few words thanked the company for this cordial display and assurance of confidenceThere was nothing more of notedone that day and 1 saw no more ofMorgan though 1 was once or twiceagain on the mountain In the morning orders were given to build up flicbarricades and all the crews weremustered and set to work We foundthe chiefs design was to make this astrong place that we might have ahaven of refuge in ease things wentwrong at PanamaBy the end of the next day we hadthe place in a very fair posture for defense whereupon Morgan had usknock off and preparation was forthwith made for the great expeditionThere were at this time in the riversome small Spanish vessels named 1t hink chatten and these with t he fourlittle ships that had been there titirst Morgan fetched up dose to thequays and armed with cannon Theobject was to strengthen that approach to the castle A fleet of canoesthat likewise had been captured together with the greater part of ourboats were then brought up to themain quay and when 500 men hadbeen told off to garrison the castle and150 more left on the ships we enterthe boats and the gun was fired forstarting Capt Brodely was still leftto keep San Lorenzo as the castle wascalled and looked a bit rueful as hesaw the rest of us so gayly settingforth Tattle did he know what was tohappen to us or what a desperatething the expedition was to be or hehad scarce worn so long a faceOur command numbered just 120men including Morgan himself andfor conveyance we had five barges tenships boats and - canoes Howeverwe knew that we were not tocoverthwhole distance by water as there mustbe some leagues of a march from thehead of navigation to the city Everyplan save one was carefully made butthat one proved of passing importanceIt was the matter of provisions whichapt Morgan thought we should taker but a light supply of as he conceivedwe must be able to find a sufficiency onthe way On a bright and not overwarm morning then with flags fiyingfrom the stern of the boats and twotrumpeters blowing merry blastswhile those on shore waved their hatand cheered the oars were set goingand we started up the riverMy companions and I were still inPrndevs command not having founda sufficient excuse for transferencethough indeed it made lift le differencefor all the companies were as onelarge otic with Morgan at the headThat day nothing of special notehappened We all greatly relished theembowering of the wootls and greenery after so long dwelling about thesea and for a time the men sang andlaughed and splashed their hands inthe water like so many joyous childrenThat day we matle only six leaguesand then as the men complained of thecrip ling of their legs consequent uponso long crouching In the boats Morgangave the order to land the place beingan attractive little savanna with abend of the forest all aboutThe woods were now dense and themarching soon grew so bad that Morgan made us halt and after a littletalk with his captains decided to takeagain to the canoes sending along afew hundred men at a time and thisthough with great labor was doneand the reserve force then beingbrought up we were once more all together The fourth day a great partof us marched by land being faintwith hunger but finding a few wildfruits of which at some risk for wewere not sure whether they wereharmful or not we partook That ekiywe were nearly exhausted Mac lvrachbeing compelled to abide altogether inone of the canoes but at nightfall wefound some huts containing severalempty leathern bajs and these wedesperately cut to pieces and havingremoved the hair boiled pounded andcut them in small bits were only tooglad to make our supper of themThe eighth morning we still staggered along weak out in a sullen waydetermined But now the terrible strainwas nearly over On the ninth dayour guides showed us a little mountain which having ascended beholdthere iay the South sea We were evenable to make out some ships whichmust have sailed freshlv from PanamaGoing down from the mountain intoI a vale what was our joy to find a considerable herd of cattle These wereattacked as though we had been a packof wolves and after slaying all wecould we cut off the flesh in greatflakes and having pitched it intohastily made fires drew it out halfroasted and greedily devoured it Itwas a sight to startle one to seie thehalf starveel wretches at their repastThey gnawed and grunted and between times broke out in laughterthe blood running down their handsand staining their garments to thewaist As to myself and my companions particularly Mr Tym it is butfair to say we behaved somewhat lesslike beasts though in truth the tasteof that charred warm flesh was to usof a sweetness and deliciousness beyond words of mine to describeGreatly refreshed and now in heartagain we pushed on and having ascended a considerable hill beheld atlast the steeples of Panama At thatthe men broke into joyous shouts asthough the city were already ours andthe drummers began to beat and thetrumpeters to blast We had scarcemade this din when there was a noiseof hoofs and a little company of Spaniards appeared on the opposite hillThe distance was short and we distinctly heard their threats as theybroke out savagely at usWe will go into camp now saidMorgan coolly To morrow we shallhave to t4st these gentlemens menacesThe men set up a cheer the second Ihad heard since the beginning of theterrible march and immediately brokeranks1 slept but ill and that not onh been use my mind was excited but becausein the night the Spaniards fetchedsome cannon out of the city and began firing upon us Fortunately theyadvanced their battery but a little wayand none of the shot hurt us but onlykepi up a considerable noise andi cut down branches from the treesabout us Mr Tym seemed much lessdisquieted than I wa3 though once ortwice he sal up and watched the commotion of the shot among the treesI fell asleep at last though I had notbelieved so till T found myself comingout of a troubled dream and my comrades beginning to stir about It wasthe gray of dawn and everythinglooked dim and cheerless the men nottalking much and no fires yet alightCHAPTER XI HOF THE OPENING OF THE BATTLEWe were speedily in order and everycaptain went to the head of his company Morgan looked in a satisfied wayalong the lines and drew his swordAt that moment he seemed to have losta little color but his bearing was boldand steady lie pointed toward the hilland with the loud word Forwardfed as into the roadIt seemed but a moment before wewere over the rise and marching downinto the little plain There to the nosmall stirring of my pulse were drawnup the Spanish forcesI thought there must be l000 ofthem The greater part were foot butThe Spaniards bad destroyed the bridgeon each flank was a considerable bodyof horse Their arms and appointmentsseemed of the best description theircuirasses and helmets in particulargleaming like pools of water withevery movementAt least 1 thought we have our workcut out I greatly doubt if we can overcome such a strong forceThis I found was the opinion of manyothers for a kind of growl of apprehension ran aroundHalt cried Morgan sharply Themen were onlv too glad to obevListen comrades he went on Youfear yonder gang but without reasonThey are not what they look I will besworn not a score of them could carryhalf a glass of wine to their lips without spilling it They tremble Theyknow us Stand firm thenThis talk put the men in some heartbut still they seemed in no hurry to advance Morgan spoke to one of thecaptains and the man stepped to thefront and ran his eye along the lineHe then rapidly selected from the different companies 50 men and these heordered to stand forward I immediately perceived that everyonechosen was an expert shotYou will make forward and beginthe battle said Morgan coolly to thegroup Put three paces betweenevery man and fire with care The restof you look about and you will perceive that the ground is soft so thatyonder horse cannot charge to advantageIt was as he said The ground onboth sides of the broad road was ameadow and in places were quags anelmiry spots It was clear that we hadbut to stand firm and repel the horseMorgan gave us no more time forreflection The captain with his sharpshooters set forward and the rest ofus were brought into a new formationsons best to repel an attack To compass this we were made to form a longsquare with double lines till facingoutward and a few little cannon wereplaced in front and rear This donewe had an opportunity to watch theprogress of our advance companyThey spread out as Morgan hadcommanded the wings thus broughtwell abroad into the meadow and sotrudged sturdily alongSome paces on they went the enemymaking no movement to stay themand then of a sudden one of the bandsof horse trotted into the road and atthe blast of a trumpet broke forwardat a swift gallopI almost held my breath as did I amsure my companions Down thunderedthe horse They deployed right andleft and were almost upon our menThen the cool buccaneers lifted theirguns and following the roar I saw theforemost of the riders flash out o1their saddles There was a pulling upand rearing and plunging of frightenedanimals and almost before I couldrealize it the remainder of the troophad reined about and were thunderingback whence they cameWe broke into frantic cheer and bya common impulse the entire squaresurged forwardLead on Morgan thundered PaufCradde we can wipe those fellows oflthe earthNot yet shouted Morgan his facenow red and firy and his voice set almost to the pitch of a laugh We mustrepel another charge or two firstAnd so it proved There was a little confusion in the Spanish ranks astheflyingriders rode back and wheeledto regain their oldstation and then another trumpet sounded and the entirebody of foot moved forwardStand fast said Morgan in deeptonesThe enemy came on slowly and ofa sudden stopped The line of gunsglittered and instantly everythingwas confused in flame and smoke Asit cleared away I saw half a score ofour advance fellows down and theother running at lull speed toward usNo one in the main body as far as Icould see was hurtOn the Spaniards came their flanksexpanding and their horse circling outinto the meadow In a flash the wholearmy seemed to be inclosing usTO BS CONTINUEDOnly They BreatheOur father was a typical officer ofthe time of Nicholas 1 Not that hewas imbued with a warlike spirit ormuch in love with camo life I doulrtwhether he spent one single night olIds life at a bivouac fire or took partin one single

packers werenot at fault and that the meats supplied to the army were of the samequality as those supplied to the tradegenerally and the recommendationthat no further proceedings will betaken in the premisesThe conclusion of the court adverseto further proceedings based upon thecharges is as followsIt has been developed in the courseof the inquiry as recited in this report that in some instances some individuals failed to perform the fullmeasure of duty or to observe the proprieties which dignify high militarycommand but the court is of the opinion that the mere statement inthe offirial report of the facts developed meet the ends of discipline andthat the interest of the service will bebest subserved if further proceedingsbe not takenThce is more or less criticism ofGen Miles in various parts of the report Probably the most direct instance is the one which states that beyond the criticism of officers foundelsewhere is the report The courtfinds that against none of the officerscommanding corps divisions brigadesand regiments and their staff officersshould a charge of guilty be broughtThe court also finds that the majorgeneral commanding the army had nosufficient justification for allthe refrigerated beef was embalmed orwas unfit for iSsue to troops It alsofinds that he committed an error icthat having belief or knowledge asclaimed that the food was unfit thatit caused sickness and distress thatsome of it was supplied under pretense of experiment that other beefwas embalmed he did not immediately report such knowledge or belief tothe secretary of war to the end thata proper remedy might be promptlyappliedThe censure of Col Maus inspectorgeneral on Gen Miles staff is basedupon his failure to call attention tocharges concerning the beef at Chickamauga contained in a report of inspection made by Dr or Maj Dalyon the 2Gth of October last in whichhe stated his belief that the beef waschemically treatedThe silence of Col Maus says thecourt on so important a matter asthe chemicalized beef reported byIJIaj Daly and personally known tohimself is most remarkableTHE HEALTH OF ADM DEWEYHe Has Not Felt the Necessity of a Physician Since His
