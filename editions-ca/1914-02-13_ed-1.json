SPECIAL TRAIN RUN- TO
VACCINATE EMPLOYES
In an effort to protect its employes
from small pox, which for the past
several weeks has keen much in evi
dence in this and .adjoining counties,
the Lonisville & Nashville railroad
company has issued an order that all
must submit to vaccination as a meas
ure of precaution.
With this in yiew a .special train was
run between Paris nd Winchester,
Tuesday. Three ."-ysicians were
aboard. They were Dr. Silas Evans,
County Health Officer, and two Clark
county physicians. A plentiful sup
ply of vaccine points was carried, and
over three hundred men, employes of
the road and laborers in construction
camps between Paris and Winchester,
were vaccinated. All of the men wil
lingly submitted.
The local authorities are of the
opinion that the situation in this
county is well in hand, .only two new
cases having appeared in the past ten
or twelve days, an as soon as re
ported the patients were transferred
to the pest house. Several have
been discharged in the past week and
there is little fear that the authorities
will not be able to hold the disease in
check.
The Chief of the Meterological Ob
servatory at Kagoshoima, Japan, is
reported to hove killed himself be

PREVENT SPLITWORM,
Department Tells How to Keep Off
Tobacco Worm.
Transplant the tcbacco crop as early
as possible in order to mature if be
fore the appearance of the most de-
structive generation of the tobacco
splitworm, advises bulletin No. 59 of
the United States Department of Ag
riculture, in making recommendation
for the control of this worm. When
the early infection is very severe,
prime off and destroy the infected
leaves; destroy all tobacco stubble as
soon as the crop is harvested to pre
vent the breeding of a hibernating
generation; clean tip and destroy 'all
trash in and around fields and to
bacco barns; do not follow potatoes
by tobacco if the infection of tobacco
has been more -severe in such cases
than where different rotation was fol
lowed; grow potatoes as far as pos
sible from tobacco fields.
In Cuba and the United States the
splitworm is known on tobacco as a
leaf-minor only. Only the loder to
bacco leaves are affected unless the
infection is very severe; and in these,
the lower leaves, grayish, irregular
bloches are produced, wheh later turn
brown and become fragile so that the
tobacco is unfit for wrappers. At
Clarksville, Tennessee, where the in
fection is very sight, the larva in
most cases begins work in the "ruf
fles" along the midrib and they after
ward migrate and form mines in, va
rious parts of the leaf.
