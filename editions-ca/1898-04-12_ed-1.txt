ImparciaLSavsthat Lieut Gen CoeafFniinisterfofwar in a conversation Saturdaywthseveral people expressed himself r asfollowsIt is an error to say that the government has granted an armistice tothe rebels I would never give thatbefore leaving the ministry becauseit would be the same thing as recognizing the belligerency of the rebelsThe government has granted thewishes of the powers that we shouldcease hostilities during the day whichGen Blanco judges prudent for preparing peace I acceded to a cessationof hostilities because to refuse thewishes of the powers would be to divorce Spain from the world If I leftthe cabinet I should be placing mysuccessor in an awkwardpositionGen Blanco will probably publisha proclamation of truce and also another offering indulgent terms duringthe cessation of hostilities If duringthis period there are important submissions and the United States with-draws its ships from the neighborhood of Cuba and the Philippines all will be well and peacewill soon be reached Otherwisethe Cuban war will continue andthe powers will be obliged to demandthat the United States maintain absolute neutrality and enforce a dissolution of the filibustering

to a solution honorable to Spain and satisfactory to America Even now despitethe ominous tone of our New Yorkcorrespondent we find it hard to believe that so signal an advance on thepart of Spain will not meet with someresponse from WashingtonIt is to be earnestly hoped thatnothing in President McKinleys message will grate needlessly upon thefeelings of Spain or enhance SenorSagastas difficultiesThe Daily Mail saysThe armistice implies a recognition of the insurgents as belligerentsand it is therefore a very notable stepif not toolateThe Daily Graphic thinks that unlessthe powers

beenpractically agreed upon Bank checksbills of exchange drafts deeds mortgages and other paper of this classpatent medicines and nostrums in allprobability will also be added to thelistA rough estimate of the receipts tobe derived from these sources is thatthe increase on these articles alone willapproximate if not exceed 8100100000a year Beer it is thought will produce an increase of 35000000 manufactured tobacco an increase of 30000000 or more and commercial paperand patent medicines 832000000 Another source of revenue which it issaid is almost certain to be availed ofis transactions in railroad and otherlisted stocks It is believedthat the returns from this sourcewill be large In all the figuring sofar the remaining industries and theprofessions which were taxed

interest They meant that shemust abandon CubaThe ambassadors of the same powerscalled upon President McKinley inWashington in the interests of peaceas a matter of form There was posibly no expectation no hope that theUnited States would recede one inchfrom its one vital demand that Spainmust give up CubaBut the powers may have felt that asthev were about to use coercion inMadrid it would be diplomatic to makea demonstration in Washington at thesame timeThere is reason to believe that thepowers have made extraordinarypropositions to Spain They have saidin effect that if she should make suchconcession to the United States asthey believed to be necessar3 thepowers of Europe would guarantee heragainst war both external and internalThe powers would delegate to one oitheir own number Austria whosethrone is closely allied to that of Spainties of blood the duty of defending Spain against any internel foesthat might arise as a menace to thedynasty as a result of yielding to

atWashington keeps on his desk in thepost office department several photographs which attract much attentionThese pictures according to Mr Whiteillustrate the most unaccountable andremarkable feat ever performed by arailroad locomotive In fact the performance is one which in the ordinarycourse of events would only seem possible where human intelligence wassmployed and it is most difficult to believe that it was accomplished by amere machine a creature of manIn speaking about the photographsthe other day Mr White remarkedThey have never appeared in print tomy knowledge and were taken for therailway mail service because of the curious nature of the great accident at NewHamburg X Y which they representThis accident occurred on the first ofSeptember 1392 when a New YorkChicago railway postal can ran into anopen drawbridge at G15 in the morning the car being badly wrecked and aportion of the mail matter lost Theengineer raid fireman who on accountof the sudden and unexpected nature ofthe accident were not afforded time tojump were killed as well as one postalclerk John HCain while METoomeyclerk in charge was seriously injuredThe other clerks escaped unhurtThe train was behind time and wasrunning at a terrific rate of speed tomake up and had reached the bridgebefore it was discovered that the drawwas open There was no time to do anything but jump and this is what thebig engine did It actually cleared the2S foot draw and landed safely on theother side the train going downthrough the opening This is the biggest jump ever recorded oy a locomotive and the post office departmentofficials think it will never be equaledTo this day no satisfactory explanation has ever been offered to accountfor the long jump of the locomotive andit can only be said in partial explanation that the engines momentxim musthave been so very great that it hadto a certain extent overcome its owntremendous weight and the naturallaws of the attxaction of gravitationwhich held it to the earth and made itfor the moment a free agent that didxmtil the speed was slackened literallyfly through space How otherwise couldit without the least support havepassed through a greater space than itsown lengthThe feature of this remarkable accident has never been prominentlybrought out before by the railway mailservice as despite the assertion of thesuperintendent of the rolling stock ofthe New York Central at the time thatthe engine had made the unheard ofjump through the air of 28 feet pullingthe mail car after it the postal authoritieswere slow to believe that a more1satisfactory explanation accounting fortheipresehce of thcTengine on the otherside of the diaw would come to lightbut it never has nor will Philadelphia InquirerVASSAR GIRLS EATAstounding

long- experienceBEINGence and having niade a specialty of serving men in the commercial line I have many reminiscencesthat are more or less entertaining-Opening- my diary at random I findnotes on the case of Hubert MeredithMy iirst knowledge of the young- mancame to me through a letter from hisfather Sir Hubert Meredith a manwith large landed possessions a strongwill of Iris ownZ will give you some history ofthe boy wrote the eld gentleman after we had some correspondence in-which it -was arranged that I was toemploy my time and professional talents in looking for the son I couldimagine the elder Meredith a selfwilled choleric gentleman who wasused to having- his own way within thecircle of his family and tenants Hefrequently underlined his sentencesand there was a vigor in his languagethat can only spring from a masterfulspiritHubert was always rebellious andintractable declared the father Ueing strong and athletic and taking tothe roughest boyish sports as naturally as a fish takes to water his spirit ofindependence grew with his years andhe had no taste for the accomplishments desirable in a son of my houseHe would rather take a dive from theside of a cliff into the river back awild colt or wrestle with some of thevillage boors than to pursue his studies though I provided him with someof the best instructors that were turnedout of Oxford my own alma materI insisted upon his tutors discipliningbim and he knew a great deal moreabout the sensations that accompanya good caning than about Greek rootsor the beauties that can be unfoldedthrough a knowledge of the dead languagesBut no amount of punishmentseemed to tame his spirit or reconcileliim to the task of being a gentlemanHad he not been an only son and a veryhandsome one at that Im certain thatI would have sent him to sea or foundhim some kind of subordinate servicein India While he was still a merehoy I reached a degree of desperationin which T decided that if he wouldonly look like a gentleman I would tryio be content But 1 could not hirehim to put on the appearance theclothes or the airs that belonged to hisclass In his hurry to reach tho freshair he would neglect all the essentialscf the toiletand by the time he returned from some boyish expeditionh duldjgJodk as though he had beenrolling about under one of vour modrn street sweepers My gentle wifeused to remind me that the wildestcolts sometimes made the best horsesbut it made me angry and 1 would saythat if his future goodness were but atithe of his present wildness he wouldindeed be a paragon among men Hewould at least be a premierBut the boy grew worse Hewould climb where a goat would notventure Lie would slide with flyinghair and shouts of exultation from theroof tree of the house a ad depend uponthe eve trough to prevent his dashing to dei Mu When there was a eoliin that was too wild and toovicious for tiie experienced men incharcrc to handle Hubert wouid takehim and those who saw them say thatthe battles were like those with deathThe punshinett he received was accepted as a matter oF course and theboy slept the sleep of the just undera conviction that he had fairly anelsquarely paid for his funI regard it s a miracle that he grewto the age when we could decentlypack him oft to school My decisionto have thir important step in hiscareer taken came in a characteristicway We had the chief dowager ofthe whole section to elinner In themidst of the meal there was a poppingfire like that of musketry the roomwas lull pt smoke the dowager was inerics andhysterics the bov was like to diefrom laughing lie had packed thesprings beneath her chair Avhh firecrackers attached a fuse and cunningly lighted it from where he hat Thatdetermined the whole matter We senthim to school as soon as practicableanel also sent fair warning of thetrouble that he was liable to make1 will omit the troubles that his instructors had with himWhen Hubertcame home with hishandsome figure his stylish clothesand his cheery laugh 1 was delightedNo one was ever better to lookupon But the happy dream wascruelly dispelled His aggressive andlawjqss nature had only taken anotherdirection I think if he had only beenit liberal I could have forgiven himBut he was a radical of the radicalsThe first time tint the political situation came undqr consideration at thetable he simply threw a firebrand intoa powefer mill We elders were notonly loyal adherents to the throne butdeprecated the idea that the middle orlower classes should have any voicein- government Tt was our duty togovern them and theirs to be gratefulfor this constant solicitude for theirinterests We renewed our pledges tothe established church and prayed forthose who sought salvation by anyother routeDuke SeJfton who never

the heresies of my son anelwhen he left the table there was ageneral nod of approval from myguestsThat fall I was induced to stand forparliament The man against meposed as a man of the people Hehael nothing in birth character orability with the nobility He was ivmere groundling but a fluent talkerand had a fiery way with him that appealed to the masses He even corrupted my own tenants But what isinfinitely worse he corrupted my ownson He took the stump He outranted the ranting canelidate My onlyson with my own name told the people in a score of different ways thatI was not in sympatb with theirwants that all ray thoughts were remote from their asperations anel that1 had no just claim -upon their votesI was beaten and when Hubertcame home I not only told him in themost taunting terms that he was disinherited anel that he was no son ofmine but that I never wanted to seehis face again anel that it would bethe aim of my remaining years to forget that I ever had a son Then Istruck him with my cane anel I havenever been able to get rid of his lookashe turned away clenching his stronghanels but never ottering to resent theblow It was more than I coulel havedoneThat night he took his

fromthe eleventh century A Toltcc chiefnamed Tepaulcatzin one day receiveda cup of strange drink sent by one ofhis noblemen mimed Papantzin at thehand of the noblemans beautifuldaughter who was called Xochitl orthe Flower of Tula The great chieftain was delighted with the new drinkand charmed with the maiden whom hewon as his wife A son born to themascended the throne of the Toltcc nation which caused internal dissensionsamong the people and finally led to thedownfall of the Toltec tribe But fromthat time on pulque has retained firstplace among Mexicans of all tribes andages and is now more largely usedthan everPulque is both a food and a drinkand among the poor it forms a very important addition to the frijoles tortillas and chile making up their limitedfare In employing a Mexican servanta few cents a day for the purchase ofpulque is generally allowed by the mistress of the house A Mexican can elowith little clothing and scanty fare butlife is a thirst panged desert if theusual allowance of pulque is interferedwith It possesses large medicinalproperties acting in a ben efi cial wayupon the digestion blood nerves andsjstem in general but if used to excessit finally dulls the intellect and makesone drowsy mid stupidOne hundred thousand quarts a day isthe average consumption of pulque inthe City of Mexico alone and specialtrains are regularlj employed in thecarrying trade between the magueyplantations and the city markets It isvended through the streets by loudlungeel peddlers who go about shouting their trade into the open doors andpatois of the houses the most is soldhowever from the multitude of pulquehias which open their invitingdoors upon nearly every ccrner for thepatronage of the thirsty where it retails at a centavo for a large glass andby the gallon

thanwhether vou look after the details infeedingwateringand supervisionWhen the hens cannot scratch for exercise or worms because of snow or frozenground they must then have animalfood and an artificial incentive tofccralch Cut bone is the cream of aniaral food and if you can get thatitpaysthe largest possible interest on anyoutput Hens can stand more slightingin other directions and still

shell materialThe amount 1 hat a flock of hens will eatseams almost incredible but they knowbest your only lookout is to see thatthe boxes are never empty A dullmopy hen rarely lays More probablyshe eats and grows fat and still doesnt3 ay Scratching- pens are desirable buteverybody cannot afford them An excellent substitute is made by throwingdown a bushel of hayseed every fewdays on the floor of the common penThe hens go for it at once and with avim It absorbs moisturegivescise and sweetens the atmosphere wonderfully On a farm there is plenty ofwaste hayseed on the barn floor Feeding is not

HomeEGGS FOR HATCHINGGet Rid of All Males Xow and ProcureXew Blood for Next Spviiigand SummerWhile it is proper to keep the breedsseparate during those periods of theyear when the eggs are to be used forhatching it is a saving of time laborand fencing to let them out on thefields together until spring comes Itis the impression on the part of somethat when birds of different breeds areallowed together the purity of theflock will be impaired but if the breedsare separated a month before the eggsare used there will be no evidence ofimpurity in the chicks hatched Wherecue has two or three breeds it is somewhat difficult to keep them separatewithout confining them in yards andas by so doing more work becomes necessaiy it is not advisable to separatethem a itiy longer than the last egfor hatching is taken There is a safeguard however should doubt be entertained in regard to retaining thepurity of the breeds and that is to getrid of all males now and procure newblood next spring It is not necessaryto have the males with the hens as theywill lay as many eggs without the malesas when they are present with theflock Farm and FiresideHELPFUL FARM NOTESDo not keep too many hens in a

because no matter for what purpose theyare intended tlie first work in the preparation for that purpose is to build upthe frame to develop the bone andmuscle says Texas Stock and FarmJournal Whenever the weather permits the sows and pigs should have freeand wide range over all the farm notdevoted to cultivation and pasturageshould be looked upon as essential totheir development If the pasturage isgood the amount of rooting they willdo will not be a damage to the rangeor the farm for thej will destroy manyinsect pests and the exercise will bea benefit to the animals A patch ofpeas should be grown on every farm forthe young pigs as well as for otherpurposes and the pigs should run inthem an hour or so every day The peashave much the same nutritive qualitiesas milk and are cheaper When thepigs have them in sufficient quantitytheir frames have a rapid developmentand they can be brought on to the cornfeeding later with lessrisk of injurythan if they had passed through thesummer on grass or alfalfa alone Butwherever in Texas the alfalfa can begrown and in many portions of thestate it will thrive well it ought to forma most important part in building upthe frames of the young animals Afterthey lwe become five or six months oldthose that are to be kept as breedersshould be separated from the animalsthat are to be fed for market Themethods of handling the former shouldnot be materially changed and suchchanges as are made in feeding the fattening animals should be made gradually and cautiously -watching them until they have been brought to full feedAt no time is it well to confine themsolely to corn Some green stuflshould be given them and some variety of food with plenty of charcoaland salt abundance of pure water andthev should have elean well shelteredquarters Corn
