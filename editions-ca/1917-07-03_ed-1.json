appointed hour the large tent with
a seating-capacity of 700 was more
than full. The schedule of the af
ternoon was .furnished by a quar
tette, the Castle Square Entertainers,
which made a good opening and put
the entire audience in a good frame
of mind for the masterpiece that was
to follow. About 3:45 Hon. William
Jennings Bryan took his place on the
platform, and was briefly intro
duced to the large audience by the
platform manager, Mr. Foster. Mr.
Bryan was at his best, and after
taking-a little time in explaining
some of the things necessary in this
war launched into the subject of the
hour, "What Constitutes a Man,"
dwelling entirely upon man's three
fold nature, laying special stress up
on his spiritual nature. All who
heard him enjoyed his address and
regreted exceedingly that he could
not be with us in the evening. In
the evening beginning at 7:30 we
were again entertained with the
Castle Square Entertainers, which
was followed by a brilliant lecture
by Ernest J. Sias.

CLASSES.
The lestest development in war sur
gery is the use of pure soap on band
ages. This method is proving very
successful, and is one worthy remem
bering in household first aid. The
only kind of soap used is the per
fectly pure white variety. The band
age is dipped in a thick lather and
squeezed out. Then the damp cake
of soap is rubbed across its face be
fore it is applied. It is said that the
soap has an excellent effect on the
wound, and prevents the bandage
from sticking "when it is removed.
