THEATRICAL.
"THE SOUL KISS."
"The Soul Kiss" is distinguished
not only by the unique idea of the
search for a kiss that comes from the
soul and all the clever comedy situa
tions of the book, written by Harry
B. Smith, but by a score of delight
ful, tuneful and catchy songs and
dances interspersed throughout. The
music, which was writen by Maurice
Levi, is full in harmony with the
lines of- the story, and has that appeal
that throws music-lovers into ecsta
cies. v.
The striking characteristics of
"The Soul Kiss" is its harmony, ex
presiveness, tunefulness and laugh
provoking situations. The music fol
lows the idea of the story now soft
and iow, now swelling into joyous
ness and thrills of the intensest kind,
ow shading off into dreamy melody,
then following the love sentiment
It is one thing to' make soda
crackers that are occasionally
good.
It is quite another thing to
make thenr so tha they are
always better than all other
soda crackers, always of un
varying goodness.
The name "Unee da "stamped on
every biscuit means that if a million
packages of Uneeda Biscuit were
placed before you, you, could choose
any one of them, confident that every
soda cracker in that package would
be as good as the best Uneeda Biscuit ,
ever baked. Five cents. f

with tender harmony, and then break
ing out into vigorous expression of
the joy of life, realizing the elaborate
setting, the color and beauty of the
forty participants, then into the cin
cupated time of the dance, when the
gayly costumed galaxy of some forty
dancers swing and whirl into that
wild fantasy of the mountain dance,
led by Orpha Hewes, direct from the
Crystal Palace, London, who was the
sensation of Europe's music-halls last
season, and all these changes are one
blended' whole of laughter, emotions,
thrills and delightful sensations, thus
making "The Soul Kiss" far and away
the baneermusical attraction of the
past decade.
The feminine contingent is com
posed of attractiveyoung singers and
dancers; not the least attractive por
tion of this production are the
"Squabs," who are nearly all of one
size, trim of form and pretty of foce.

As n spial extraction for the
Cincinnati's Merchant's big fashion
week, the B. P. Keith management
has n ranged a fashion plate vaude
ville e'low vlvca will show entirely
new stjles of the E. F. Keith standar
of modern vaudeville. Visitors to
Cincinnati during fashion week will
see a remarkable array of vaudeville
features the equal of which has nev
er before been seen in Cincinnati.
The big headline attraction will be
Jesse ' Lasky's Red Heads, with a
suberb cast of pretty people, headed
by James B. Carson. This is the fea
ture act that made such a decided hit
with President Wilson at B. P. Keith's
Washington Theatre on September
19th. There are twenty beauties se
lected from the Broadway success for
their physical charms. Mr. Lasky
has the best production of his
career as a thatrical producer and
his red heads will no doubt prove as
popular to the people of Cincinnati
as they did to President Wilson. For
fashion week these beauties will wear
a varied assortment and gorgeous
costumes from the largest modiste
shops of Paris and Fifth avenue. The
millinery display will be very ultra.
The act will have plenty of lively
comedy and catchy easy-to-whistle
music that is conspicious in all Las
ky's productions.
Then there will be Homer Miles &
Co., presenting a comedy sketch "On
the Edge of Things." This is an act
that treats witlflife in the tenaments.
Falis and the Barry Girls will present
knock-out success "The Boy Next
Door." Cleo Gascoigne, the doll pir
ma donna from England and the
smallest performer with the biggest
voice in vaudeville, will make her
first -appearance in America. Little
Cleo has a most magnetic personal
ity and has wonderful technique in
singing, which should make her an
instantaneous success. The Field
Bros., modern exponents of singing
and dancing, will make things lively
in their act, and Harry DeCoe, dare
devil with the tables and chairs, will
thrill the audience twice a day. Her
bert Dyre & Co. are sure to get many
laughs with their comedy pantomimic
act, and these are only a few of the
big features to be seen at B. F.
Keith's big fashion week show.

Local theatregoers are looking
forward with keen interest to (the
coming of "Broadway Jones' ' to the
Lexington Opera House Friday even
ing as Mr. Cohan's new play created
a veritable sensation in New York,
where it had a run of an entire sea
son, playing to capacity business, and
is conceded to be the greatest com
edy this brilliant young author has
yet produced.
Mr. Cohen's latest effort is a com
edy devoid of slang, -as that verna
cular is popularly defined, but it nev
ertheless contains enough smart and
breezy chatter to keep the four acts
in which it is written whizzing along
at a pace that keeps astride the mark
maintained on all Mr. Cohen's for
mer efforts. At the opening of the
play "Broadway" Jones is arriving
home very late in a condition that
could not be arrived at very early.
Though he is popuarly suppose to be
very rich, his continued attempts to
"burn up Broadway" have cut big
inroads into his forame,until at the
beginning of the play he is penniless
and heavily in debt. In order to rid
himself of his numerous obligations
he engages himself io a rich widow,
old enough to be his mother, and
though his friends try to break off
the engagement they do not succeed.
Then Jones, the hero, gets word
that his uncle has died and left him
a big property in the shape of a Chew
ing Gum Factory in Jonesville, Conn.,
and here the real action of the play
begins. In the scenes that follow the
young fellow is brought around from
a desire to sell his factory and con
tinue his wild career, to an earnest
determination to keep it for the good
of the little Connecticut town of
which it ,is the sole industry, and
"Broadway" Jones, money-burner,
man-about;town , becomes Jackson
Jones, factory owner and a respected
man in his communitjv
The cast includes: Thos. V. Em
ory, Curtis Benton, Geo. B. Miller,
Maurice M. Fisher, Mrs. Chas. Will
ard, Miss Olive Artsell, Miss Mor
issey and Miss Indie Whitesides.
