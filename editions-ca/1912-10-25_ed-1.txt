This billremovedthe duty from agricultural implements.'of which 836,000,000 worthwere exported land only- $165,000,000worthwere"imported during' the lastfiscal year; sewing machines, fencewire, bagging rand cotton ties, lumber,shingles, meat, flour, salt, leather,shoes, etc.Under our new tariff law a barrelof flour valued at 4 abroad i3 taxed 25per cent, ad valorem at oui port, or SIon the barrel. This bill removed theentire tax.Beef valued at $5.30 per 100 poundsabroad pay a tariff tax equivalent tu25.88 percent, or SI. 50 per 100 pounds.Thisbill proposed to remove this entire tax.ThejDemocratic wool bill proposedto reduce theaverage rate of duty onwool manufactures from 90.10 percent to 48.36 per cent. PresidentTaf t's veto of this measure means thatthe American people will pay $50,000,000 more for their clothes this yearthan they would have if PresidentJTafthad signed it.A wool hat valuecTat SI abroad andtaxed 78 cents upon its'entry into theUnited States under the present tarifflaw, would have been taxed only 49cents.'Flannel underwear valued at $27 perdozen suits is taxed under the presentlaw at the equivalent ad valorem rateof about 106per cent. The Democratic bill proposed to reduce this to 49percent. A suit of ready made- woolen clothing worth in Europe $10 istaxed under the present law at 'theequivalent advalorem rate of 75 perI cent, or $7.50. The Democratic billproposed to reduce this tax from 75 to49per cent, and save the consumer$2.60 per suit.The cotton bill reduced the dutieson cotton manufactures from 48.12 percent to 27.06 per cent, a reduction ofthe, tariff burdens under this ( schedulefrom not less than ,$200,000,000 toabout:S112,000,000 for a year.Men's cotton half hose valued ateighty cents per dozen pairs wholesaleare taxed under the present law atthe equivalent ad valorem "rate ofabout 92 per cent.

This Democraticbill proposed to reducethis tax to 30per cent and-save the consumer $1.20American- consumers in a twelvemonth period more than $80,000,000.The revision of the chemical schedule would have effected a saving toAmerican consumers of about $17,000,000by reducing. the price of all chemicals and at the.same time the revenueto the Governmentwould have been increased. The House passed a bill providingfor an excise tax on incomes, therebytransferring a considerable portion ofthe tax burdens to the wealthy, whichare escapingtheir proper proportion.The Excise Tax bill passed by theHouse Drovides for the extension ofthe Corporation Tax Law so as to include individuals, firms and copartnerships. It accomplishes the very desirable purpose of transferring tax burdens from those less able to carrythem to tne shoulders of the wealthy,who have heretofore escaped from aproper share of taxation for the support of the Government.The present burden of indirect taxation falls upon people having incomesof less than $2,000 per year. A manvhose net earnings amount to but$5,000 a year would under this bill payno tax. A man earning $10,000 peryear would nay nothing on the , first$5,000 and $50 per year on the second$5,000.Here is a woman who speaks frompersonal knowledge and long experience, viz., Mrs. P. H. Brogan, of Wilson, Pa., who says, "I know from experience that Chamberlain's CoughRemedy is far superior to any other.For croup there is nothing that excelsit."

As ecclesiastical lawdemands that female worshippers shallcover their heads in church, this regulation was curiously anomalous. Asuggestion in regard to ladies' headgear was also made by Sir FredericCowen in 1906, when he gave it as hisopinion that the ladies might discoverin, their wardrobe some "extremelyfascinating flat hats," which wouldnot obstruct the Tiew. The "fascinating flat hats" ware, however, chieflyconspicuous by their absence, owingpresumably (we write subject to feminine correction) to the fact that theflat hat was not among the fashionsfaf that year.

Wheeler & Co.Ohio Convict Captured in Paris.'After being at liberty a little c vertwo months John Emerine, an escapedconvict from the Uhio penitentiary atColumbus, was arrested in WinchesterMonday night, brought to this city andreturned to Columbus yesterday morning, where he'will serve the remainderof a ten year sentence.The arrest of Emerine was broughtabout by Patrolman Fred Link, of thiscity. The escaped convict had beenworking in the city as a telephone lineman for'thP Bourbon Home TelephoneCompany. He had been here abouttwo weeks.Monday evening Patrolman Link followed the man into the saloon of L.Saloshin on Seventh street, where heengaged him in conversation, at thesame time studying his features closely,' and soon came to the conclusionthat the man tallied with a descriptionhe had received from the penitentiaryauthorities.Having several pictures in his pockethe pulled them oufwhen Emerine, whowas looking over his shoulder, suddenly grabbed them from his hand andran through them hastily. Handingthem back the man excused himselfand hurriedly left the fcsaloon. In afew minutes he returned, conversedfreely with a number of men in thesa'con and left the place again, sayinghe wuuldbe back in a few minutes andwhen he did not return the officer instituted a search, but Emerine was nowhere to be found. Knowing the manwould possibly escape on the fastsouthbound tram which left here at 12o'clock he hurried to the depot, buithe train had departed.Patrolman Link telephoned to vWinchesterand requested the police department to arrest three white menand two negroes who were hoboingtheir way. Officers Insko and 'Strodemet the train and placed Emerine under arrest.Parolman Link went to WinchesterTuesday morning and returned withEmerine in the afternoon. The prisoner acknowledged he was the manwanted and for whom a reward of 50was offered. He told the Paris officerafter'reaching hereJTuesday that oneof the men in company with him on thetrain was an ex-convict, jby the nameof Doyle, who had escaped with himfrom the penitentiary, but through amistake of the Wicnhester officials hewas released. Roberta. Miles, superintendent of the Bertillion departmentof the prison came to Paris Wednesdaynight andjeturned to Columbus withthe prisoner. According to the Columbus official he is one !of the Severestcrooks in the country and when hemade his escape, aided four others,among them being the man namedDoyle.Emerhie was sent up from Piquacounty, Ohio, in September, 1909, toserve a ten year sentence for burglary, of which he had served fouryears. He escaped from the penitentiary on August 13, 1912, and has sincebeen in;several large cities. He returned to Ohio without requisition papers. Emerine. who was known in prisonas No. 38313, .told ;Patrol man Link ofhis escape from the penitentiary whichwas accomDlished by dropping overj the prison wall while he, wi.h several, others, were painting a roof of theprison. OneofAhis confederates fractured his skull from the fall, but theothers were successful in making theirescape in spite of the fact that theywere showered with bullets. While here( Emerine went under the name of J.'A. Henry and boarded with Mrs. A. O.Erwin on High street. He claimed tohave some money due him from thetelephone company where he was employed and requested Patrolman Linkto collect the amount and pay hisboard at Mrs. Erwin's.The prisoner said he was willing toreturn to Columbus and finish his timeas he had tired of roaming over thecountry dodging the police, and thatwhile he hoped to escape detectionhere he knew his capture would beeffected sooner or later.The reward offered by the State ofOhio for the capture of Emerine waspaid Patrolman Link by Mr. Miles yesterday morning, a part of which willbe paid to the Winchester police.ahhb HHmHr HHEfryiMILLERSBURG ITEMS.Mr. E.

He has never been ableto keep a place and, so far as I canlearn, has never had a complaintagainst him. I have heard many ofyou talk about him in the last 24hours, and this is what you make himout: a faithful, capable workman;industrious, honest, reliable in allthings, gentle to women and littlechildren, kind to dumb animals, untiring in self-sacrifice for the sick andhelpless. In addition, I know him tohave been a God-fearing, repentantman."It was not much he asked of thiscommunity only the right to live byhonesthard work, and a little a verylittle human companionship. We, denied him both! We saw a strugglingsoul go down in dumb agony and wedid not lift a hand to save him. Afriendly greeting, a hearty handshake,a word of neighborly interest wouldhave been to this man as cold waterin a thirsty land. But we did not givethem. He asked us for bread and wegave him a stone."I asked if he was afraid to die.No, he said, he did not believe Godwould be as hdrd on him as his fellowmen had been. I think he was right.He said: If there had only beensomebody that I could have told itwould have been different; but therewas no man, that would know me;refuge failed me; no man cared formy soul.' Oh, brethren, brethren, mayGod forgive us!"The old minister had been speakingin an impassioned tone. He stoppedsuddenly. Then, there being nothingmore to say, he raised his hands inbenediction, repeating with gentle emphasis which might haVe passed forirony, but probably was only force ofhabit:"And now may the peace of God,that passeth all understanding, keepyour hearts and minds, through Jesus !Christ, our Lord. Amen."Ma' 'Liza had been playing besidethe grave, sticking her alder bush intothe soft mold and pulling it out againto find a better place. As she feltthe tug of her mother's hand shestuck it in firmly and said, her sweet,childish treble smiting the stillness:"I give my f'owers to Zebbie!"Mrs. Freno caught her to herbreast with a sob, and laid her branchbeside it. The act was infectious. &sby one impulse the women came and Jcast their flowers upon the moundwith gentle hands and falling tears.And when the procession moved fromthe cemetery Zeb Horn's grave was amass of snowy, fragrant blossoms.But the man was dead! From Caroline Abbot Stanley's "The Master of;the Oaks."Oil-Burning Engines.Dr. Rudolph Diesel of Munich lectured at the Institute of MechanicalEngineers in London recently, on theindustrial importance of the Dieseloil engine of which he is the inventor.He declared that by this engine themonopoly of coal had been broken andthat the problem of using liquid fuelfor power production-in Its simplestand most general form had been solved. It could be used with all naturalliquid fuels. What the steam engineand gas engine were for coal it wasfor liquid, but was much simpler andmore economical. Researches, headded, had shown that there was probably as much liquid fuel as coal inthe globe. . New petroleum sources,said Dr. Diesel, were continually being developed; new oil districts werebeing discovered. The world's production of crude oil had increasedthree and a half times as quickly asthe production of coal and the ratioof increase was getting steadily higher. Forty per cent of the present production of mineral oil, he added, wasalready sufficient to supply the wholenaval and mercantile fleet of theworld with power if they worked itby the Deisel engines.Testing the Fly Line."One thing about a flat that summer tenants will never take an agent'sword for is the fly line," said a Philadelphia real estate agent. "They wantto find that out for themselves andresort to various subtle schemes. Onewoman to whom I showed a flat Tuesday came back on Wednesday to lookat it again, and confronted me in triumph when she found several fliesroosting on the window sill."T felt that you were mistakenwhen you told me yesterday that thisapartment was above the fly line shesaid, 'so I rubbed a chocolate creamon the sill and came back today onpurpose to see If the flies had traveled this high.'"Of course they had. With a chocolate cream for a magnet a fly wouldcrawl to the top of the City Hall tower."

London Daily News.PODrtiMionROOSEVELT BAITFOR SUFFRAGISTSThird Term Candidate Was Consistently Their Enemy TillHe Needed Their Votes.GOULD HAVE GARBED OHIO,But Big Bull Moose Took to the Vermont Woods Noted Woman ExposesHis Change of Front.BY IDA HUSTED HARPER.The Progressive party had its firstopportunity to show its loyalty to thewoman suffrage plank in its platformwlien the vote was taken in Ohio on anew constitution. Forty-two amendments were on the ballot, and all wereadopted except the one for womansuffrage!Ohio is one of the "banner" Progressive states, and Mr. Roosevelt expectsto secure its electoral vote. In orderto do this a plurality of the electorsmust be Progressives, and they couldtherefore have easily carried the suffrage amendment if all the others hadvoted against it, as the vote on the constitution was very light, only a fewhundred thousand out of more than amillion who were eligible. Did he issue any orders to this effect? Did hesay to his followers: "Now, here is ourfirst chance to show the women thatwe mean business. Of course if wewin in November we will give thefranchise to nil in the United States,but just now we can make good bygiving it to those in Ohio, so let everyProgressive vote for the woman suffrage amendment?" Did he do this?On the contrary, he completely ignored the matter, although he passedthrough Ohio the very day of the election.A few days before, at St. Johnsbury,Yt, Mr. Roosevelt had devoted a largopart of his speech to showing howstrongly he believed in the ballot forwomen and how anxious he was forthem to get it. The question was notan issue there or likely to be, but itwas a vital issue in Ohio, to be settledin four days, and yet not by spoken orwritten word did he show to the peopleof Ohio that h knew of its existence.Two days after the Progressive partyin Ohio permitted the defeat of thisamendment its state convention met.If any women were elected delegatesthe press dispatches failed to mentionit, and in the platform a woman suffrage plank was conspicuous by its absence. "The Progressive party pledgesitself to the task of securing equal suffrage to men and women alike," saysits national platform, and Ohio hasjust given the first example of the wayit apparently means to keep thatpledge.In Mr. Roosevelt's second term thesuffragists determined tp make everypossible effort to secure an indorsementfrom him. As Miss Susan B. Anthony'smost eloquent letters to him receivedno answer, she went in person to seehim In November, 1905, just fourmonths before her death. With all herpowers of persuasion she pleaded withhim to recommend in his forthcomingmessage some recognition of woman'sclaim to a voice in the governmentLaying her hand on his arm, she lookedup into his face and said, "I beg of youto be the emancipator of woman asLincoln was the emancipator of theslave." He was not resembling Lincoln so much in those days as he is atpresent, and he remained totally unmoved by her appeals.Scant Courtesy at White House.Shortly before he left the WhiteHouse several officers of the NationalSuffrage association, realizing his greatinfluence on public opinion, made onej last effort to have him speak a favorable word. He. came into the outsidelobby of the executive office, requiredthem to state their business before thecrowd waiting to see him and wouldhardly give them a chance to speak,but kept saying, "Go and get anotherstate." He shrugged his shoulders andturned on his heel, and then they said,"If we will get up a petition of a million names will that influence you?""No," he replied, "not one particle."That was in 1909. The next year aletter from him was read at an antisuffrage meeting in the Berkeley theater, New York, in which he said: "Iam very tepid on woman suffrage."The cause of woman's enfranchisement has no more Implacable enemythan the Outlook, and Mr. Roosevelt ison the editorial staff. Last Februaryhe had in that magazine a ten columnarticle entitled "Woman's Rights," butthe only right considered was that ofthe suffrage. The article was such anexcellent exposition of the attitude ofwomen who do not wish to vote thatthe Anti-suffrage association orderedcopies for distribution. In this articlehe said again. "In our western stateswhere the suffrage has been granted towomen I am unable to see that anygreat difference has .been caused ascompared with neighboring states."And yet just four months after thispublication, when Mr. Roosevelt haddefinitely decided to make the contestfor the presidential nomination, all hisscruples about forcing suffrage on a.hostile and indifferent majority vanished in thin air because a million anda half already had votes and the colonel wanted them, and he knew theywouldn't stand foi any nonsense about1 a referendum.LIGHT ON ANCIENTPANIC ARGUMENTHistory Demolishes RepublicanClaim That Democrats MakeHard Times.1893 WAS UNDER HIGH TARiFFEvery Panic Since the Civil War HasBeen a Republican PaniFrom 1907 Upheaval.essonsThe enemies of Democracy are making their anticipated and regularly recurring howl they are predicting hardtimes if Woodrow Wilson is electedpresident on a Democratic tariff revision platform.The Republicans are claiming alicredit for present prosperity.A glance backward will be worthwhile at this time.Every panic since the civil war originated and developed under Republican rule.The Republican campaign textbookof 1904 devoted much space to themany business disasters occurring fromJuly, 1893, to November, 1894, intending the public to attribute them to theinauguration of President Cleveland inMarch, 1S93. But the Republicans failto refer to the fact that the Republican tariff law was in force during morethan twelve of the sixteen months ofgreatest business disasters. This factmust be remembered the McKinleytariff bill became a law Oct. G, 1S90,and the first indications of the 1893panic were seen Nov. 11, 1S90, scarcelymore than thirty days after the McKinley law was passed, and the panicreached its worse stage in 1S93 andearly in 1S94, during which time theMcKinley law was in full force.Millions Lost Their Jobs.It may be recalled, too, that thepanic of. 1S73 under Republican ruleand in a period of twelve years of hightariff taxation, was most disastrous.It continued five years, 3,000,000 workingmen were thrown out of employment and bankruptcy ran riotIn 1S90 the McKinley high tariff billwas passed, and there were 10,G73 failures, followed by 12,394 in 1891. Thetariff was raisdd to nearly 50 per cent,but wages stood still or declined whilethe cost of necessaries advanced.The most serious labor troubles inthe history of the United States haveoccurred under Republican high tariffs.Some Lessons From 1907.The Republican panic of 1907 furnished another forceful refutation ofthe Republican claim that Democraticadministration and hard times, lowertariffs and panics have been co-existing.In 1907, in the midst of prosperity,thousands of leading banks, with hundreds of millions on deposit, suspendedcash payments. The trouble began asa result of a struggle between greatNew York financial institutions for business. The New York Post in October, 1907,said:Condemn Themselves."The certain and significant thing isthat it will be known as a Republicanand high tariff panic. Protest as Republicans may, they will be held responsible. Out of their own mouthsthe Republican party and the.Dingleyites will stand condemned. They fixedin 1S9G the standard by which theycannot escape being judged. In theparty platform of that year they referred to the panic of 1893, and the hardtimes following, squarely to charge upthe entire accountability to the partyin control of the national government.and the political inference was statedwith merciless logic:" 'Every consideration of public safety and individual interest demands thatthe government be rescued from thehands of those who have shown themselves incapable of conducting it'"Now, what are the Republicans going to do when the Democrats handthem back their poisoned chalice?A great emergency has comeand the high tariff is seen to be of noavail whatever. It was to keep us allrich and prosperous.""Because the country has just gotover the results of a Republican panicthe president and his friends are urgingus to perpetuate the Republican administration," says the Philadelphia Record. Business Depression."As soon as business was checkedfive years ago the steel corporation,which was encouraged by Mr. Roosevelt to swallow the Tennessee concern, then its most formidable potential competitor, drew its fires andthrew about half Its workmen out ofemployment. Other industries did muchthe same thing. There was anextensive stoppage of mills in Philadelphia. "The Republican candidate for congress in the Kensington-Richmond dis-t trict is using the 'soup houses of 1S9.Vas a means of scaring the wage earnersfrom voting the Democratic ticketThose soup houses existed under theMcKinley tariff. But there have beenmore recent ones. After 1907 therewere soup houses in the KensingtonRichmond district and everybody whowas charitably disposed was , beggedfor contributions to feed the peopleWho were out of employment"Lie Not WormLiving For Many.Tona Vita Will' Change all ThisIn a Few Short Weeks.Nervousrun down, worn out. halfsick people are being made into strong,healthy, happy ambitious men andwomen every day by the tonic.

For three successive dayshe refused to take Aunt Maria's photograph. On the fourth day he toldwhy."In justice to her," he said, "I donot want to take her pictures now.She is too homesick. Most out-of-townpeople want to be photographedwhile in the city. If they are longingfor home I put them off with one excuse or another until the homesickness wears off."If you want your aunt's pictures toturn out well, just hunt up some onefrom her home town who happens tobe visiting here at present and bringhim here so she will meet him unexpectedly.
