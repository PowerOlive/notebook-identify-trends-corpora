and Work AnAll Night SessionWashington March 4 Excitementconfusion heavy strain and hard workhave characterized this the last legislative day of the Fifty fifth congressin the senate At times the confusionwas so great in this usually staid anddecorous body as to render thetransaction of business almostimpossible Business that ordinarily would have the undivided attention of every senator on the floorwas transacted amid so much noisethat it wlis next to impossible to followthe proceedingsTowards midnight order was beingevolved from the seeming chaos of theearly part of the day and evening andthe prospect was fair that congresswould adjourn at noon Saturday withits absolutely necessary work completedWhen the senate convened at 11oclock Friday morning it faced thetask of considering two of the great appropriation bills those for the armyand for supplying the general deficiencies The former carries appropriations exceeding 380000000 and thelatter about 320000000 With a determination to complete the appropriation bills the senate began immediately at 11 oclock in the morning to consider these measures and at 8 oclockFriday night the army bill was passedthe deficiency bill having been passednearly three hours beforeA conference report on the Alaskacriminal code bill was presented andagreed toA partial report on the sundry civilappropriation bill was agreed to butthe inability of the senate conferees tosecure an agreement on the Hawaiiancable proposition created a heated discussion in the course of which SpeakerReed was alluded to in uncomplimentary termsThe Toledo exposition bill carryingan appropriation of 8500000 was passedwithout debateFriday night when the river andharbor conference report was presented a debate upon the recession of thesenate conferees from the senateamendment providing for reservoirs toirrigate arid lands at the headwatersof the Missouri river was precipitatedby the advocates of the propositionAn effort was made to recommit thebill

the lastlegislative day of this congress werebeing enacted Step y step the leaders in charge of the appropriation billapushed them through the final stagesand during every lull in the consideration of

the papersthe detective had two hours beforesubmitted to himxYnd if lie should agree with MissHuntington that the letter was writtenby Gielow what then asked LampkinHendricks shrugged his shouldersId be compelled to believe him asmuch as twould upset a certain theorycf mine He knows his business henever has been mistaken in an analysishe has given 20 years of his life to thestudy of all kinds of ehirographyJust then the graphologist rose tookthe two specimens of writing in hishand and came towards themWell said Hendricks have youfinished your analysisYes and I have never been morethorough in my life Mr HendricksXot a single detail has escaped a careful scrutiny every character hos beenexaminedAnd jour opinionThat the two nre written by thesame handThe face of the detective fell In amoment however he was smiling as ifthe report had been fully anticipatedYcu are quite sure he saidId stake my life and all I hope toleave my family on itWell I lad to have your opinionandHendricks gaze wandered to one ofthe windows He forgot to introduceDr Lampkin and the professor andwhen the doctor extended his hand and-went through the formality himself theexchange of platitudes between the twomen did not attract his attentionAll at once he sprang up and graspedtee doctors armCome on old man he said I havelots to do before night Professor I amvery much obliged to you Send in yourbillWhere to now asked the doctor asthey were descending the narrow stairsBlame me if I know answered thedetective with a sheepish laugh Iguess Ill have to sleep on the new turnof affairs But I know how we can killtime anyway Sergt Denham sent meTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY MARCH 7 1899word this morning that hed like to seeme I know what he wants He hasgot hold of some clew that he is banking on and he wants to crow over meLets run up to his office round the corner While hes shooting off his mouthI bet my hat he will let out his secretyoung detectives always doDo you believe Prof Westcott wasright in his opinionI do not doubt itAfter that nothing was said on theway to Sergt DenhamsAs they were shown into the anteroom they saw the young officer in theadjoining office his feet high up on hisdesk smokingSeeing his visitors he called out toHendricksOh hello here vou are How goesitSo as to be about I guess saidHendricks extending his handI heard some time ago that you werein the Gielow affair remarked the sergeants and then I heard the report contradictedOh you mean the Caruthers casesaid Hendricks with emphasis on thename as he introduced Dr LampkinThe officers eyes did not leave Hendricks face as he shook hands with thedoctor and mumbled something indistinctlyI see he said to the detective youobject to the use of Gielows name Ehboys he turned to three of his subordinates in the other room did youcatch on to that The great HighMucky Muck of New York detectivecircles thinks we are too previousThe three young men laughed heartily and Hendricks slowly winked theeye which was next the doctor and justout of the sergeants line of visionDont name the kid before its bornhe said If it were to turn out thatGielow is innocent vou would feelcheapIf yes if replied Denham knocking his heels together and puffing athis cigar and thereupon his allies united in another chorus of merrimentI heard the night the severed handwas discovered that you were on thespot nosing around after a job Thesergeant said this with a grin Hendricks Ill bet you thought at firstthat the heiress would put up a big priceto run the murderer downHendricks assumed a lifelike expression of embarrassment He took outhis handkerchief and blew his nose tillhe was red in the face Denham pointedat him and his companions entered theroom and stood round smilingI hit you there old man said Denham But later when you found outthat Gielow had fled and that the heiress was soft on him you knew the bottom had fallen out of your prospect soyou gave up and havent had the heartto go near your office for the last fivedaysHow do you know that questionedthe detective with a well assumed startWhen my men have nothing to doI let them amuse themselves in gratifying my natural curiostiySpying on my movements gruntedHendricks and there was much of genuine irrepressible contempt in his toneYou may call it that if you wishsaid Denham patronizingly and hetouched Hendricks arm There is noharm done I hope I wish you well inall you undertake Im sure To tellthe truth Im rather sorry you are notworking on the case for I wont get asmuch glory out of it as if I had a distinguished rivalIt was now Hendricks turn andagain he winked the eye next to the doctorI dont see where the glory will comein he said Anybody could rundowna crazy manDenham was unable to conceal theeffect the word had on him He puffedat his cigar his restless gaze avertedfrom the face of the half smiling detectiveIs that your belief Hendricks hesaid finally with a weak assumption ofamusementDoes it look like the work of a rational mind questioned HendricksDenham shrugged his shoulders uneasilyYou perhaps forget that Gielowmight now want it to appear that heis and was insanePerhaps so agreed HendricksYou fellows are better calculated tojudge than I with the case well inhand As for my not being at the office I have really been laid up sick athome This is mv first dav out and thisis my physicianOh I see exclaimed Denham Totell the truth I was at a loss to knowwhv vou wrere not at least interested inthe matter Thats why I wanted youto drop inI see you have been feeding theVultures of the Press remarked Hendricks with a grinCouldnt help it answered the sergeant shamefacedly Some of themare warm friends of mine Julian Mygrane is a great journalist and givessome tip top dinners But we have keptback a lot The hoaxes alone wouldhave filled pages of the papers We received a letter from a druggist up inHarlem wrho confessed that he had doneit and offered to explain if we wouldsend up to him He turned out to be offhis bast but we said nothing about itBecause it would have made you appear ridiculous to be running after suchcharacters smiled HendricksWe dont bother with them answered Denham sharply In this casewe have had three hoaxes attempted onus Only this morning a young marbrought in a linen cuff with some wordswritten on it in blood over Gielowsname The fellow said he had picked itup somewhere One of my yo mg menquestioned him closely and being satisfied that it was a joke perpetrated bysome one on the man who brought thecuff to us he let him goLampkin saw Hendricks eyes flashinvoluntarily and then his face becameimpassive rainWhat were the words on the cuffhe asked indifferentlyOh I dont remember I was verybusy at the time and only heard theboys laughing about it It was the workof a crank Gielow was made to saysomething about being innocent andstarving and confined by a bantamchicken or something equally as ridiculousThe stonelike attitude of Hendricksas he listened showed absorbing interest but in a moment he had thrown itoff and he said lightlyLet me see the thing if its lyingroundDenham knocked the ashes from hiscigarOh it isnt worth your notice I Wethrew it away You see Hendricks Idont mind telling you that we have ourcase in tip top shape No hoax of anykind can lead us from the work in handWe know exactly where Gielow is andwill have him in the Tombs in 48 hoursAh exclaimed Hendricks Youhave actually located himBeyond a shadow of a doubt saidthe sergeant and then one of his mencalled him into the other room Illbe right back he said to HendricksDont hurry awavWhen they were alone in the roomHendricks laid his hand firmly on thedoctors kneeMy God he whispered impressively I must get possession of that cuffIt may now be on its way to the cittrash piles and heaven only knows itsimportance Think of a mans fate being in the hands of such idiotic boasting blockheads Hush hes coming Ifyou want to learn to lie listen to menow If lvincf fails I dont know whatI shall resort to Ill have that cuff byfair means or foulSorry to leave you apologized Denham coming backGot a match asked Hendricks taking a cigar from his pocket and bitingthe tip off itDenham gave him one and Hendi icksstruck it on the sole of his bootI was just thinking of something recalled by your hoax of the cuff helaughed It is a big joke on me whichIll never tell unless I can absolutelyprove who perpetrated it and get evenSo they actually work em on youdo they grunted the sergeant proffering a cigar to the doctor He wasalmost jovialI should think so said Hendrickssmokircr This one got me out of bedTHE TWO ARE WRITTEN BY THE SAMEHAND0at three in the morning and cost me cabfare to Brooklyn and not only that butit kept me there on a false scent forthree days and nightsTell us about it said Denham witha horse laughNever said Hendricks shaking hishead Xever unless I can jail thejoker and Ill do it some day or breakmy neck trying Now it may surpriseyou but I see a sort of connection between this cuff joke and the one workedon me In fact I think if I had thecuff I could run my man down Itmay furnish me the very clew I needOh thats the way the land lieslaughed the officer He leaned backin his chair till be could look into theother room Oh I sa3 Trimble hecalled out to a stenographer at a deskin the corner Come here a minuteThe young man approached and stoodin the doorwayDo jou know what became of thatbloody remnantIt was in the waste basket this morning said the young man it must bethere yetBring it to Mr Hendricks pleaseWhen it was handed to him Hendricks took it to a window and lookedat it carelessly then he smiled and putit into the pocket of his top coatIts exactly what I am looking forhe said I am going to have some funwith a reputable citizen of New Yorkand if you have time sergeant Ill letyou make the arrestDenham smiled There was vastcondescension in his tone when hespokeIt really seems strange to me Hendricks that you can give yourself upto such trivial things when there is somuch actual work to be doneAh for you my boy Hendrickssaid as he extended his hand but remember this is one of my off periodsIll get to work one of these dajs andthen Ill put you on your mettle Imnot dead yetI hope not I hope not answeredDtnham as he turned back towards hisdskBut as if obeying a second thoughtHendricks stopped in the doorwayI say sergeant he called out If3 cu could put me on to the address ofthe young man who brought you thiscuff I think I could hurrv up the fun abitThat is out of the question the officer replied We let him go withoutmaking any record of him Wed bea pretty lot of fools to spend our timekeeping a set of books to fill up with theInsane whims of all the cranks in NewYorkHendricks laughed pleasantlyWell I guess you are about righthe saidHe did not speak again until theywere in the street tatd then bechuckledHow was that doctorSir Henry Irving could not have doneit better said Lampkin My friendmy pride in you is as boundless as Interstellar space You are more than a detective you are an histrionic geniusHave you really made a find in thisbloody messageHendricks grunted and his brows metThere is a chance for it to mean nothing I will not know till I can seeGielows servant Come with me Itsmore than worth looking intoAs they hurried towards 5nadwyto take the cable cars ap town a heavysnow began to fallThis is really no day for you to beout counseled the doctor Ycumight take cold andHTake the first car and here shecomes laughed HendricksDuring the ride up town the face ofthe detective was the battle ground Mmany inward emotions Lampkin believed he read in it a great impatienceat the slow progress of the car for ittook on almost a scowl aseach stop wasmade So deeply engrossed in histhoughts was Hendricks that he illowed a beautiful young woman tostand holding to a strap directly infront of himTO BE CONTINUEDTHEY LOVED

heard a light step in thielittle lobby which was partitioned offfrom the rest of the room For a moment he did not answer the summons ofthe bell it was never wise to be in toomuch hawte to welcome

Out the Departments OrdersIsaiah H Leighton postmaster atWesit Pembroke received orders fromWashington to transfer the mail servicefrom the old stage route to the new railroad and to get the exact distance between the station and the office in order to determine whether the government or the railroad company shouldcarry the mail between those pointsBeing something of a mechanicalgenius Mr Leighton devised a schemefor making the measurement He tookan old wagon wheel and after measuring its circumference to ascertain thedistance covered by each revolution arranged the wheel between two poleswheelbarrow fashion Near one of thespokes he attached a clicker that sounded at each complete turn of the wheeland thus equipped he started from therailroad station for the post office taking the middle of the road and carefullycounting the number of clicksAs he mounted the hill making goodprogress and not mining a click he metseveral teams coming at a trot andthey made so much noise that he losthis count and had to go back to thestarting point On the second trip hewas bothered by groups of curious people who followed him to see what hewas about The people made so manyfoolish remarks andi swapped so manyjokes that when he had reached 234clicks he again lost the run of thingsand once more had to go back lie saidnothing but it was plain that he wasgetting vexed On the third trip he hadmade about half the distance whenthrough thinking of the foolishness oihis neighbors he again lost his countand1 then with remarks more pepperythan polite he raced back to the station and made a fourth startBy this time a great crowd had gathered and some of the people began toshake their heads and drop remarksconcerning mental weakness resulting1from overwork and the prevalence ofinsanity among- inventors and othermen of genius Mr Leightontcouid nothelp hearing some of these remarksand he responded with great vigor oflanguage finally with wrathful looksturning his back upon the rabble andstarting for the fourth time up the hillAs he went along village oys yelledencouragement to him Now youre atrottin lo it old mai youre apacer and so on Mr Leighton stoodthis all right but at the top of the hillh met a friend who possessed morecuriosity than discretion and thisfriend grabbed him bv the arm and bellowediSay Leighton what in thunder areyou trying to do anyhowThat a t tied it For

purposes weighs about 0O pounds Of thisamount there arc in the carcass twosets of first quality ribs consisting ofseven ribs in each set and weighingabout 40 pounds per set There arealso two loins weighing about 40pouiids each There is on an average175 pounds of choice beef in each wellregulated steer but some butchershave been known to sell porterhousefrom a carcass after everything wasgone but the horns The remainder ofthe beef after the choicest has beencut away is called the misnomerfrom the fact that it sells at a lowerprice A large percentage of the mostnutritious meat is found in the coarsercuts but nearly everyone demands apirt of the 1T pounds which is a falseidea of domestic economy as well asjudgmentPractical experience has shown thatthe utilization of the chucks the bestpart of the round the hump flank thepeate and brisket gives the best resultsand is conductive of better health thanthe higher priced meats Such partsneed more attention while cookinghowever yet the many tempting dishesthat may be made from them morethan repay for all extra trouble Theaverage housewife may not know itbut nevertheless it is a fact that butchers who are daily and hourly handlingall kinds of cuts of beef almostinvariaably choose for their own consumption flank steak They say it is moresavory and just as tender as tenderloinwhich cut the butcher seldom eatsThe flank steak is situated between theinside and outside layers of creamycolored fat in the flank and when takenfrom well fed stock is excellent Itcosts at the market but half as muchas porterhouse or sirloinAn old butcher once told me that thebest piece of meat in the bullock formaking a dish of boiled beef is theclose grained top piece over the shoulder bladeMeat adhering to the ribs makesmuch more satisfactory steak than theso called sirloin and costs but littleThis piece may be larded and served asis filet de boeuf It is also quite acceptable as Mignon steak Omaha WorldHe raidPromising
