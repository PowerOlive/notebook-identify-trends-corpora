WHY OUR WORK IS GREATEST.
FARMERS, TREAT YOUR SEED
WHEAT FOR STINKING SMUT
The Goverapnent 'is especially urg
ing all farmers planting wheat to
treat their seed. The method is sim
ple and inexpensive, costing only
about two cents per acre.
It is advisable for' all the seed
wheat to be treated, from the fact
that in a case where the infection is
slight it-is practically impossible to
detect the presence of the smut.
In Kentucky the past year 278,000
bushels, or 3 of the wheat crop
was destroyed by the stinking smut.
Next year the wheat acreage will be
greatly increased. If something isn't
done more than likely a larger
amount of wheat will be destroyed
than last year. Treat your wheat
help yourself and Uncle Sam.
The U. S. Government, in co-operation
with your State University rec
ommends the following method:
( 1 ) Spread seed on any tight floor.
(2) Make up solution using 1 pint
of formaldehyde (formolin), to 40
gallons water.
(3) Have someone shovel grain
over and sprinkle with solution, us
ing common sprinkling can. Get
grain damp enough to stick to hand,
using Vz to gallon solution per
bushel.
(4) Cover with cloth, sacks, etc.,
for 2 to 4 hours.
(5) Spread grain out to dry.
A good practice to treat seed one
day and sow the -next. Formaldehyde
can be bought at any drug store.
Precautions:
(1) Make up solution just" before
treatment. Do not use solution which
has been standing anytijme.
treated grain by using dirty sacks,
etc.
(4) When sowing day after treat
ing open your drill enough to insure
the right proportion of seed per acre.
There is also a bluestone, or cop
per sulphate method which can be
used for prevention of this smut,
though more expensive.

THAT OTHER ARMY.
Not only America but the world
is singing the praise of the Yanks.
They have had their baptism of fire
and have nobly stood the test. They
have vanquished the best of the crack
Prussian division set to stay their
advance. They have "upheld every
tradition of American arms and have
thrown a chill of apprehension into
the very heart of -the German hordes.
They are winning their crosses every
day.
But there is another army of
which no American is proud, nor ever
can be.
That other army of non-buyers of
Liberty Bonds.
In it are the slackers, the pacifists,
the so-called conscientious objectors,
the miserly dollar pinchers and the
pro-Germans; the cringing, apolo
getic contemptibles of earth.
And there also to their shajme are
those others who are selfishly indif
ferent to the sacrifices being made
for their protection, their safety,
their continued existence in a land of
peace and liberty. The smug, self
satisfied apostles of ease, content to
let others serve.
This is the army that is fast get
ting beyond pardon.
Thank God you are not in it!
And if you are, desert.

SUMMERS.
The funeral of Mr. Samuel Sum
mers, aged sixty-two who died at his
home on South Main street, in this
city, Monday, after a long illness,
was "held at the fajmly residence at
nine o'clock, Wednesday morning,
with services conducted by Mr. A. L.
Boatright. Following the services at
the home the body was taken to Eli
zaville, in Fleming county, for bur
ial, the funeral party preceeding
there in automobiles.
Mr. Summers had been in declining
health for several months. Some
time ago he suffered a stroke of par
alysis, which was indirectly the
cause of his death. He had for the
past thirty years been in the employ
of the Louisville & Nashville railroad
in the bridge construction and water
supervision departments. He was re
tired some months ago by the rail
road company on a comfortable pen
sion for his long and faithful service.
Mr. Summers was married twice,
his second wife and her child, Mrs.
Edward Spears, surviving. Two chil
dren by a former marriage also sur
vive, Mr. Ed. Summers, of Paris, and
Mrs. Alma Miller, of Wellington,
Kansas.
S 5 IS
(St. Louis Times.)
There is no rivalry among the al
lies for claims of credit, but there is
a tendency on the part of some states
men to discuss the three great powers
on equal terms. Recognizing Eng
land's wonderful work on sea and
land, "holding back no - credit from
France and Italy for their defensive
and offensive programs, we still urge
that the greatest work of the war
has been done and will be done by
America.
It was America that fed England
and France when food was the first
essential. It was America that fur
nished munitions legally at a critical
moment, and it was America that
sent 'the reserves when the allied re
serves were failing.
But this is -not the big thing; the
real thing of the war is that we have
sent a million and a half men across
3,000 miles of water and an average
of half that distance over land. No
other nation has done this. Our boys
are fighting far frojm home. Eng
land's men are merely across the
channel from "Blighty" and France
is fighting on her own ground. When
the war is over the big credit for
winning it must come to America,
where it belongs.
