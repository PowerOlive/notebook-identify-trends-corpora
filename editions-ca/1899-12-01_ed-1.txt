fruit He stooped to the tankcock and three experimental jets ofsteam sputtered up in impatient bubbles through the cold water Somewhatrelieved he shut the valve and glancedat the clock on the wall Apparently ithad stopped like the rest of the worksThe slowest gang of girls I everhe snorted Dave was a high-boiler but he frequentlylet offA youngish brown whiskered man ina pink golf shirt jumped on the edge ofthe tank and balanced there perilouslyHe was the manager of the CaliforniaConsolidated Apricot company Restlessness and vehemence boiled down heaf ten said he paid Dave extra wages tohelp him fume One reason why themanager managed everything so wellwas because he knew so well how tomanage the managerHang it Dave said he the minute a girl gets o be good for anythingshe quits and marries If I could keepmy best help life would be worth livingCome girls comeIt quickened the workers across thehalf partition this clarion call and theglimpse of the managers tense faceThe boss is getting cranky said abrown haired pirl with rubber glovefinders on hurriedlv poking a halfthe top of the can All the packers hadtheir finders protected against thecruel curve of the tin White cottonrags would doHave you noticed how the boss hasduded up lately asked the blond whosozzled the sirup into the packed1 canswith the rubber lawn hose that camewn from the vat in the attic She wasther stately and ambrosial and reminded one of Hebe on a frieze irrigating her row of gods with sweetenedwater The California Consolidatedhad dumped a ton of sugar into its nectar pots that very morningDont you sabe asked anothergirl Jessie did pretty prontoSpanish adapts itself elegantly to slangin the southwestOh j oure locoed rejoined Hebeswishing the nectarous nozzle from onelittle tin god to another with an elysiandisregard of the spill ice managerwill look above Jessie she addedYou seeDave had turned the valve again tndthe steam roared into one of the bigtanks Another hissed and growledand the conversation of the girls wasinaudible The packers had caught ujwith the process room and the apricotfactory was in full blast How daftlythe sealer blistered the yarn of solderaround the can tops which spun on therevolving disks in front of him Themetal string ran down from a coil ovrhis head the whirling can caught itand the hot iron tied the knot Theother workers might fall behino butthe sealer could stand in his trackshold his hands over the whirligigs lookpleasant and keep caught upThe manager drew a breath of satisfaction as he saw the platform of anslowered into the hissing bath Giveem 45 minutes this time Dave he sad1and passed into the labeling shedIf there was anything that pleasedthe manager more than another it washis labeling department and perhapshe could not have told whether his labels or his labeler gave him the morepleasure To the eye they were equallyinviting The cream-and-yellow undertones of the enameled wrappers appealed to ones imagination theytasted good Upon them the designerhad ripened1 two juicy apricots suggesting that the only bite in the worldworth taking came from the fabulousorchards of California Its the labeland not the stock that sells the packthe manager would admit in a confidential moment The golden apples ofthe Hesperides would have humbuggedmore people than they did had therebeen lithographers in those daysJessies left hand picked up a glisteninar label and her riht seized a can offruit one end of the label flirted daintily through a little pool of paste at theend of her bench the can revolved onceand rolled itself into the wrapperdone An ugly tin had turned into athing of beauty Jessie had merelybeckoned and- it had jumped into itsyellow jacket Small wonder was itthat the other girls thought she hadbeckoned the manager into his pinkshirtHe stood for a moment and admiredher The lines of her fair face andblooming figure had not been hardenedby the months she had spent in the cannery earning her dollar and 60 centsa day I wonder if I shall lose hertoo the manager said to himself Itwould be hard to tell all that was in histhoughts then Most of the time hewas thinking of the success of the company and the difficulties of keepinggood help By jove he went on hiscountenance lighting up with a business inspiration Ill put her picture onthe new pie labelThis enthusiastic intention was intended as a compliment and perhapsmore With his absorbing devotion tothe fruit trade and his glory in thestanding of his brands possibly themanager could not have thought of ahappier distinction than having onesface stamped in green and gold onthe glittering labels of the CaliforniaConsolidated No 1 Pie Apricot Andindeed has not la diva been flatteredinto serving the less gorgeous designsof tooth powder and soapThere was a little hiss an audiblefermentation then a pop and slim Apyramid of cans toppled over and asplash of yellow lusciousness wat flunguDon the managers golf shirt Jessiewiped a sticky blotch from her rosyface A box of freshly labeled tins wasin disgraceCussed carelessness exclaimed theangry manager See here DaveSirAnother burst Can set away witha leak in it again Why dont you stopsuch slovenly workThe mender went over em all muttered DaveWith his eyes shut commented themanager savagelyAccidents will happen the cookpersistedIf theres another in your department therell be a shake upThe managers tone closed the conversation with a sort of bang It hurtDave as though his finger had beencaught against the door jamb and theworst of the pain was that Jessie hadheard The manager had not said anything so very bad if he had not said itbefore Jessie Dave wondered if therewas any foundation for the girls gossip about the pink shirt and all thatHe turned a flushed and injured facetoward JessieHurt Jess he askedNo she laughed still beckoning tothe cans That was all but it seemedto soothe Dave and he laughed Jessielaughed too The manager was in hisoffice seriously divesting himself cfapricot juice and sugarTt seemed cooler in the steamy kitchen though the mercury was risingThrough the open door Dave soon sawthe manager strolling among the hurrying cutters Some of the girls couldhalve the cot and flip out the pit withone quick twist of the knife and thumbine mot ion seemed simr e butyouapricot through the little round hole in I could not understand it at first sightHaveem look a little sharper aftertheir sorting Miss Bumble the manager called after a flash of his quickeye around the roomAll r 0 V sir-whosaid the forelacPvwas clicking a hole with a tirkpfpunch in the tag of a fat and wheezingcutter who had brought her pile of pitsto get credit for having finished a boxof the cots A hole in her tag wasworth six cents to her My aint ithot she puffed wiping her face withher apron It was late in July and thesun beat remorselessly on the corrugated iron roof The fat woman wondered why the manager had not setsome eucalyptus trees around theworks as she stood in the doorway fora moment and gazed longingly at themountains half hidden by a gray gauzeof dust Looks like a Santa Ana saidthe wheezy oneTrays sang out a shrill trio of sopranos in the cutting roomAlways short of trays I believe theboys eat em growled the managerpassing through to the kitchen andshaking things up all along the lineThe manager spent more time in thekitchen than in his office not altogetherto the gratification of Dave The cooking was a critical process and thenfrom the back door of the kitchen themanager could keep one eye on the labeling Privately Dave had expostulated to Hebe that it didnt do the helpany good to eye em all the time whereat Hebe winked privately and luminously at the sealerThe last batch of the forenoon hadbeen put in to cook and Dave scannedthe water closely to see if a tell talebubble was escaping from a leaky canSuddenly the water quivered Dave felta little jar and heard a crash as if atall stack of loaded trays had toppledover in the cutting roomTrue to his trick the manager leapedup and stood astride a corner of one ofthe big tanks peering across the halfpartition to see what the mischiefThere came a creaking sound Thebuilding swayed the partitions heavingand the boards grinding against eachother There was another jar as if afreight shifter had bumped into thecannery then a tremendous splashand sprays of water hissed upon thesealers hot ironsA second of staring startling silencewas followed by a chorus of shrieks thatoverwhelmed all things After theearthquake was over the girls had timeto be frightenedMy yelled the sealer the boss isparboiledFor a quivering moment the wholecannery seemed horror stricken thenall rushed for the tank One woman fellin a faint and the others swept by herDave stood as if paralyzed1 but with aqueer look on his face that was eitherlunacy or amused self possessionThere were sounds of a struggle in thetank but no cry was heardWith blanched face the sealer brushedby Dave and reached for the steamvalveNo said Dave holding him backthats a cold tankThe manager was clambering out rejecting courtesies He was dumb paleunreconciled It was his weakness totake himself too seriously If nobodyelse laughs at him a man should jollyhimself once in awhileThere was only one titter and it camefrom the labeling shed The managerturned colored bit his lip and wrungout his brown side whiskers Then oneword of fire escaped him and he hurried off the pink shirt clinging to himlike e shiny sticker on a canWhen the new pie label came out itwas decorated with a striking figure ofa mountain lion showing his teeth andcrouching for a spring which was atonce businesslike and appetizing themanager said to the artistJessie Dave whispered as they saton the porch one September eveningafter she had put on the ring wouldit have been any different if therehadnt been any quakeJessie laughed Who knows sheevaded1 Jessie was always rather elusive but Dave caught her in his armsand took several satisfactory answersSan Francisco ArgonautExhibit of SerpentsBrazil will exhibit 500 varieties oilahuman sacrificethe Writ Indies it la Practised liSpite of Church andStateFrom a British island in the Leewardgroup of the West Indies the cablebrings the news that a man is in custody of the circuit court for sacrifice toa heathen god a blood offering of achild to Mumbo Jumbo to obtain hisaid in discovering a hidden treasureEvidence that human sacrifice andadherence to other rites of the primitive religion of the West Indies still exists in these islands is every now saidthen coming to the surface These riteshave not been stamped out by the efforts of four centuries and among thedescendants of the aborigines and ofthe early importations of Africans theyprevail very much more strongly thanis usually admitted particularly in theinterior of the islands Not that humansacrifice is at all common but the mostobservant travelers say it is more frequent than imagined and that manycases of murder and mysterious disappearance simply mean the furnishing of the human victim whose deathis followed bv cannibalismaIn most of the islands to the magic ofthe aborigines has been added the voodooism of Africa magic of a similarsort through which the deified forcesof nature are propitiated like that of ahuman sacrifice particularly the sacrifice of a young and innocent life Thiscounts for more than dancing howlingfasting torturing and the variousforms of incantation to which the voodoos are givenIn this latest case the attorney general says that the child was unquestionably made a victim of the still livingearly superstition for the purpose ofpersonal gain to the murderer and theprisoners counsel admits as much butstates that his client is not the murdererThe fact is that in nearly all of theserites and ceremonies the purpose is forimmediate personal advantage ratherthan for immunity from suffering hereafter Mumbo Jumbo is appealed tofor everything from a change in luckto protection from death and so strongis the belief that superstitious foreignsailors are afflicted by it and they havebeen known to go to the native priestsfor charms and to join in incantationsthat involve dancing singing prayingthe sacrifice of a goat and the drinkingof the goats bloodEven human sacrifices have been witnessed by white men in the West Indiesand the Catholic archbishop of Haytitells a well authenticated5tory of howa young priest of his see in 1893 wentto the interior of the island and whiledisguised with blackened face andhands witnessed the sacrifice of ayoung child who was afterward devoured by the assembled congregationThe law has been slow in apprehending those who have committed murderin the name of their religion becauseit is extremely difficult to learn thefacts in the first place and yet moredifficult to find the perpetrators Usually these ceremonies take place in theinterior away from large centersand under the protection of dense foliage so as to be known only by thosewho take part and the fact is alwayssafe in their keepingSo far do the believers in the ancientbloody rite carry their feelings and sogreat is the satisfaction that they takein that faith and in keeping their beliefs secret that they have been knownto join the Christian church participate in its ordinances and sacramentand then at regular intervals go intothe fastness of some forest appeal tothe spirits and perform their incantations with exuberance ofr joy as thoughthey had done something that wouldmeet with the approval of the godsN

to a claim apieceCHAPTER XIIDIGGING A FORTUNEHank Bowers did not for a momentimagine that the big bowlder had fallenbv accident On the contrarv he realized it had been purposely rolled thereto prevent his ingress It followedthen that he had been seen approaching the cliffThere must be some sort of a valleybehind this ere cliff he concluded ashe stood measuring the distance to thetop of the obstructing stone with hiseye an that feller wont keep me outof it longWith a confident air he retraced hissteps to the opening and removed thepacks from his horses Then he tooka coil of rope on his arm and enteredthe cleft once moreBowers had been a cowboy once andwas an exper with the - He hadnoticed a sharp spur on sideof the barrier and with a a asthe looped his rope around it at tattempt Then with an agility vremarkable in so large a man he drt twhere they now could pick and chooseover the entire valleyB Jwers watched them with an easyair as they spoke in low tones for amoment for he knew well they couldbut decide one way Presently DickTaylor said bluntlyWhat you say is true m regard tothis place We dont want you butwe are obliged to have you Get yourstuff up out of sight We will help youdo that for our own sake After thatyou will keep aw ay from our camp anddig all you pleaseAn hour later his outfit was in thevalley and as he busied himself puttingup his tent he wore a self satisfied expression that boded ill for the peaceof the men upon whom he had forcedhimself so cleverlyBut if Hank Bowers could have beenpresent at a little conference that nighthe would not have congratulated himself so suddenly He was a deep rascalbut he had different material to dealwu than the sailor in w hose companyhe had recently beenDick Taylor was a very shrewd sortof a person und while he had beenforced to receive the stranger into hiscamp he was determined he should notremain there after they were ready tohave him go To get rid of him in away that would keep his- tongue sealedin regard to the gold they had foundwas the problem and he had thought ofa way which he hoped might answertheir purposeThat night he detailed his scheme tothe others and all agreed that it wasthe wisest course under the circumstances What it was will develop laterI dont believe a word about hisbreaking with that Rider he addedwhen the whole ground had been goneover Theres no doubt in my mindthat theyve put up some job betweenthem Theres live of us anyhow andwhile hes in camp we must keep aneye open nights Well divide the timeup and it wont come hard We willstay in this tent of course and wewont let him know but what were allasleep He wont do anything until wehave a bigger pile than weve got nowTheir plans being arranged the littleparty separated for the nightbutAveryshared the cave with his daughter ashe thought it safer This was also therepository of some 10000 worth ofgold which the two men had ulreudytaken from the spotOn the following morning work wascommenced in earnest and the piles ofdirt began to melt away before the vigorous attacks of the men while HankBowers dug manfully by himself a shortdistance away apparently satisfied totake them at their word He was anexperienced miner and his little pileof dust grew steadilyThat night the result of their combined eflort was nearly 1000 andTom Scott could hardly be content totake the necessary time for sleep Itseemed to him that his fortune was already madeThree days of unremitting toil followed the average being a little lessthan the first day Then Avery saidas they were starting out the fourthmorningPPTaylor we are Gigging in the wronghimself up about 20 feet until he was pplac altogetherThe wrong pi aca TYes thats what I said Ive waitedto see how rich this dirt is and I am notsatisfied Dont you see Dick you havebeen digging here by a stream that runsnow but it isnt the stream that cutthat big hoie through the face of thecliff That goes off in another direction altogether you seePerhaps a hundred or a thousandyears ago this stream wasnt runningat all Now where must the bed of thestream have been that did cut its waythrough that rock You can see it musthave been over there on the other sideof the ridge Ill bet that old streamran thousands of years before it driedup It must haveHow do you know asked Tom inwonderBecause it would take that long towear through the rock as it did It wasa bigger stream than this by a gooddeal See those big stones scattered allaround in its bed It must have been apowerful stream to start them andthere they are everywhereBy thunder I believe youre rightcried Taylor excitedly I car see itnow I ought to have known it at firstbut we struck good paying dirt on thisside and didnt prospect any furtherCome on lets try over thereHold on a bit replied AveryYoure not headed for the best placeThe others locked at him to see if hewas joking but his face was very1 earnest and he went onIt makes lots of difference wherewe dig We may be surprised here anyday and cant hope to keep this place toourselves a great while We dont wantto waste a day Just look at that bendwhere the round pebbles are collectedThere was a strong eddy just there Under the ridge of such a place is apt tobe more gold than anywhere else Letstry there first and if we dont find goldIm no prophetHis words carried conviction and theparty seized their shovels and hurriedto the spot at once They found it covered with shingle the debris of centuries Below w as a little dirt and thenthey struck a layer of gravelTom Scott was working with all hismight He had taken about a foot ofgravel from the place about a yardsquare when as he drove his shoveldown it struck something which feltlike a rock A moment later he had lai 1bare a few inches of rough shaly surface just as the others also struct thesame obstructionI guess Ive struck bottom he aidruefully We cant dig hereAs he spoke he scraped the surfiieof the rock under his feet carelesslywith his shovelSomething yellow caught his eye andwith a little exclamation of surprisehe dropped on his knees and brushedawav the dirt about itTO BE CONTINUEDInsympatheUThe author of Twent

papers but his cupidity was inflamed and he had beendrinking then He was sober now andthe evident intention of his comrade toattempt to bully or rob five armed menwas quite another matter Still therewas no help for it and he tried to steelhis cowardly heart to its workBowers relieved him at midnight andas soon as ne first streak of daylightcould be seen he arouved the mate andsaidIm off

mutteredBowers to himselfAs the rider drew near the miner wasforced to throw himself at full lengthon the ground to escape being seen andhe fingered his revolver grimly Tarbox was too busy with the horses to lookvery sharply about him and soonturned back after giving the animals afew sharp blows which sent them offat full speedThen he returned to his party andat last they had all disappeared fromsightBowers waited until he was satisfiedthat they would not reappear then hestretched his cramped limbs and hurried back to Rider who was impatiently awaiting himWhat are they doing asked

shovels and hurriedto the spot at once They found it covered with shingle the debris of centuries Below was a little dirt and thenthey struck a layer of gravelTom Scott was working with all hismightra

TimesHeraldFEZ AND TURBANHow These Two Oriental HeaddressesOriginated Among theMoslemsThe fez is of Grecian origin but it isworn among- the Moslems with a muchimproved style The original loosenessof the fez and the too bulky tassel havebeen discarded and the cap is generallynow lined with finely-worked-out reedor mat a Turkish innovation whichhas been adopted by others the Egyptian and Soudanese soldiers exceptedThe town of Fez in Morocco gies itsname to the cap which is manufactured there and the fez had some antique conenction with Fezzan in Tripoli It is a very comfortable cap butthe continuous wearing of it bringsabout baldness which is probably dueto the excessive perspiration it causesOttoman Greeks orientalized Furopeans and some Asiatics adhere tothe fez in Constantinople but unlikethe Turks who love the red stainedfez they prefer one of a darkish colorPersians admire the plain black fezand the Russian Moslems favor coarseblack The vast extension of the fezfrom the Turks to the non Turks particularly the coreligionists of theTurks beyond the borders of Turkeyis due firstly to the religion of theMoslem preventing him from wearinga shade to his eyes and secondly because the Turk is looked upon by Moslems as the defender of the faithA turban genrallv consists of fromeight to ten yards of cloth and is as arule only worn by emauns or Moslempriests those who made the hadj orpilgrimage to Mecca among theological students and by a few Asiatictribes Turbans are also made of silkand the colored turbans of the BritishIndian soldiers together with theirred uniforms all contribute to give thearmy a most pleasing and warlike appearance Among Moslems those whoare attired in green turbans claim tobe descendants of the prophet butsince the color of the Islamic banner isalso green green turbans have becomefashionable among the orthodox Indeed a green turban is merely an external signification of the devotee being a Mahometan such as the afhMuhammed to a proper name
