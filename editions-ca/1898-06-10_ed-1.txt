Santiago de Cuba on Mondaysays- that the forts about the harborare now a mass of ruins The Morrois now a shapeless pile of ruinedmasonry and dismantled guns and thetil nearly 11 oclock Ten of the American warships maintained a steady andcarefully directed fire against El Morocastle and the batteries at Punta Gorda Socapa and Cincoreales in additionto bombarding- the Spanish fleet in theharbor The percental of effectiveprojectiles was very largeTt nrmpnrs from the best information obtainable at this place the cablestation connecting- with Santiago deCuba that immense damage was inflicted on the enemy The Spaniardsadmit that the bombardment from theAmerican fleet was most destructiveAbout 1G00 projectiles are said to havebeen fired by the American war shipsand it seems that the responsive firefrom the Spanish forts and ships wasscarcely felt at all by the AmericansThe fortifications near the entranceof the harbor are described as beingriddled with solid shot and shatteredby the explosion of the immense shellsfired by the American battle shipsThe Spanish batteries are understoodto have been virtually silenced and ElMorro and the fortifications at Socapaand Punta Gorda are reported to havebeen demolished by the three hoursuninterrupted hammering- of the American fleetThe American attack is nex t said tohave been specially directed againstAguadores a small coast town a littletothe east of the entrance of Santiagobay The idea of the American admiral it seems was to land troops andsiege guns there after reducing thedefenses of the places and then makea close assault upon Santiago whichin view of the present condition of itsfortifications maybe expected to 3ieldvprv snnri after the of suchan attack Heavy cannonading- waopened upon Aguadores at about midday MondayThe latest advices received here fromSpanish sources do not indicate theduration of the fire or whether American troops and siege guns were actually landed at Aguadores but from theinformation obtainable it can not bedoubted that the net result of Mondays fighting was extremely disastrous to the Spanish defensesIt is also understood here that theCuban troops maintained throughouthe greater

killedThe Spaniards acknowledged that agreat deal of damage was inflicted onthe Spanish cruiser Reina Mercedesand they say Morro castle shows greatgaping breaches in its wallsLater in the day it appears a landing of American troops was effectednear Daiquiri some distance east ofAguadores and near the railroad station connecting with Santiago Lateran engagement took place between theAmerican force and a column of Spanish troops which had been sent againstthe landing party The accounts ofthe battle obtainable here being fromSpanish sources do not set forth theresult and therefore it is to be inferred that the Americans were victorious and that is the belief whichprevails hereIt seems to be admitted that the fireof the American soldiers was so effective that the Spaniards were compelledto flee from the fortifications theywere defendingAll the Spanish forts are in ruinsThe Americans did just what theystarted out To do and their victorywas completeThe fire was tremendous

Olympia through it all In thefirst assault the flag ship took the leadthe other vessels following in her wakeat four ships lengths The Spanishfleet was approached by laps eachturn bringing the contestants nearertogether By this plan the Americanvessels frequentlr poured broadsidesinto the enemy but were themselvesmore exposed to AreAt one time the smoke became sodense that it was necessary to drawaside allowing the cloud to lift Thevessels were examined and it wasfound that they had sustained no damage Breakfast was served to the menand in a few minutes they re enteredthe fight with the greatest enthusiasmThe second fight was even more fiercethan the first It was in that that theBaltimore was struckDuring the first fight the Spanishadmirals ship steamer put bravely outof the line to

FortsCape Haytien Hayti June 9 It isreported here that a great battle hastaken place at Caimanera in the Bayof Guantanamo At 530 Tuesdaymorning five ships of the Americansquadron opened a heavy bombardment of the fortifications of the townThere was a perfect hail of bombs inthe bay striking and demolishingmany houses beyond the fortificationsOn the Spanish side the artillery replied vigorously maintaining for sometime a stout resistance The fire fromthe war ships however never slackened for an instant It was regular andcarefully directed and a great majority of the shots proved effective TheSpaniards were forced to abandontheir positions on the shore and retreat to the town of Caimanera properIt is supposed that later they fledfrom that position also with the inhabitantsInformation has reached here thatthe Spanish at Santiago and Caimanera are preparing for a final struggleand are determined to resist the assaults of the Americ ans to the last extremityThe commander of the district issued orders Tuesday to burn Caimanera before yielding it into the handsof the Americans The latter forcedthe entrance of the bav of Guantanamo and according to the latest advices from Caimanera it was fearedthat the Americans would make an effort to land forces this Wednesdayafternoon Measures to prevent thisif possible have been taken by theSpaniards The American fleet wasstill maintaining its positionCable communication with Cubawhich -has been interrupted for manyhours1 was partially restored Wednesday afternoon but it is still difficultand precarious The report of thebombardment at Caimanera came bycableThe bombardment destroyed a littlehouse which sheltered the shore connection of the French cable at Caimanera though whether by the explosion of bombs from the wateror by explosives used by a partysent for that purpose is notknown The cables uniting themain cable with the office of Caimanera and the town of Caimanera withSantiago were cut thus accounting forthe prolonged absence of intelligencehere as to operations in that vicinityIt is also believed that the cable atSantiago is cut as no direct news fromSantiago has yet been received at CapeHaytien since Monday at midnightEven before the cables in Guantanamo bay had been injured so that theycould not be worked the operators atthe Caimanera station were forced toflee by the fire from

3ut there was a sound intheir voices which Btfg gested rumAt length IthotygfotSW5g5I might returntoward ths stockade I was pretty fardown on the low sandy spit that incloses the anchorage to the east and isjoined at half water to Skeleton islandand now as I rose to my feet I sawsome distance further down the spitand rising from among low bushes anisolated rock pretty high and peculiarly white in color It occurred to onethat this might be the white rock ofwhich Ben Gunn had spoken and thatsome day or other a boat might bewanted and I should know where tolook for oneThen I skirted among the woods untilI had regained the rear or shorewardside of the stockade and was soonwarmly welcomed by the faithfulpartyI had soon told nry story and bega nto look about me The log house wasmade of unsquared trunks of pineroof walls and floor The latter stoodin several places as much as a foot or afoot and a half above the surface of thesand There was a porch at the doorand under this porch the little springwelled up into an artificial basin of arather odd kind no other than a greatships kettle of iron with the bottomknocked out and sunk to her bearings as the captain said among thesandLittle had been left beside the framework of the house but in one cornerthere was a stone slab laid down byway of hearth and an old rusty ironbasket to contain the fireThe slopes of the knoll and all theinside of the stockade had been clearedof timber to Imild the house and wecould see by the stumps what a fineand lofty grove had been destroyedMost of the soil had been washedaway or buried in drift after the removal of the trees onlj where thestreamlet ran down from the kettle athick bed of moss and some ferns andlittle creeping bushes were still greenamong the sand Verv close around thestockade too close for defense theysaid the wood still flourished high anddense all of fir on the land side buttoward the sea with a large admixtureof live oaksThe cold evening breeze of which Ihave spoken whistled through everychink of the rude building andsprinkled the floor with a continualrain of fine sand There was sand inour eyes sand in our teeth sand in oursuppers sand dancing in the spring atthe bottom of the kettle for all theworld like porridge beginning to boiOur chimney was a square hole in toeroof it was but a little part of thesmoke that found its way out and therest eddied about the house and keptus coughing and piping the eyeAdd to this that Gray the new manhad his face tied up in a bandage for acut he had got in breaking away fromthe mutineers and that poor old TomRedruth still unburied lay along thewall stiff and stark under the UnionJackIf we had been allowed to sit idlewe should all have fallen in the bluesbut Capt Smollett was never the manfor that All hands were called up before him and he divided us intowatches The doctor and Gray and Ifor one the squire Hunter and Joyceupon the other Tired as we all weretwo were sent out for firewood twomore were sent to dig a grave for Redruth the doctor was named cook Iwas put sentry at the door and thecaptain himself went from one to another keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wantedFrom time to time the doctor cameto the door for a little air and to resthis eyes which were almost smoked outof his head and whenever he did so hehad a word formeThat man Smollett he said onceis a better man than I am And whenI say that it means a deal JimAnother time he came and was silentfor awhile Then he put his head onone side and looked at meTs this Ben Gunn a man he askedI do not know sir said I I amnot very sure whether hes saneIf theres any doubt about the matter he is returned the doctor A manwho has been three years biting hisnails on a desert island Jim cant expect to appear as sane as you or me Itdoesnt lie in human nature Was itcheese you said he had a fancy forYes sir cheese I answeredWell Jim says he just see thegood that comes of being dainty inyour food Youve seen my snuff boxhavent you And you never saw metake snuff the reason being that inmy snuff box I carry a piece of Parmesan cheese a cheese made in Italy verynutritious Well thats for Ben GunnBefore supper was eaten we buriedold Tom in the sand and stood roundhim for awhile bareheaded in thebreeze A good deal of firewood hadbeen got in but not enough for the captains fancy and he shook his head overit and told us we must get back to thisto morrow rather livelier Then whenwe had eaten our pork and each had agood stiff glass of brandy grog thethree chiefs got together in a cornerto discuss our prospectsIt appears they were at their witsend what to do the stores being so lowthat we must have been starved intosurrender long before help came Butour best hope it was decided was tokill off the buccaneers until they eitherhauled down their flag or ran awaywith the Hispaniola From nineteenthey were already reduced to fifteentwo others were wounded and one atleast the man shot beside the gunseverely wounded if he were not deadEver time we had a crack at them wewere to take it saving our own liveswith the extremest care And besidesthat weiad two able allies rum andthe climateTHE

hadalready breakfasted and increased thepile of firewood by about half as muchagain when I was awakened by abustle and the sound of voicesFlag of truce I heard some onesajr and then immediately after witha cry of surprise Silver himselfAnd at that I jumped up and rubbing my eyes ran to a loophole in thewallCHAPTER XXSILVERS EMBASSYSure enough there were two menjust outside the stockade one of themwaving a white cloth the other no lessa person than Silver himself standingplacidly bjIt was still quite early and the coldest morning that I think I ever wasabroad in a chill that pierced into themarrow The sky was bright and cloudless overhead and the tops of the treesshone rosily in the sun But where Silver stood with his lieutenant all wasstill in shadow and they waded kneedeep in a low white vapor that hadcrawled during the night out of themorass The chill and vapor taken together told a poor tale of the island Itwas plainly a damp feverish unhealthyspotKeep indoors men said the captain Ten to one this is a trickThen he hailed the buccaneerWho goes Stand or we fireFlag of truce cried SilverThe captain was in the porch keeping himself carefully out of the way ofa treacherous shot should anj be intended He turned and spoke to usDoctors watch on the lookout DrLivesey take the north side if youplease Jim the east Gray the westThe watch below all hands to load muskets Lively men and carefulAnd then he turned again to the mutineersAnd what do you want with yourflag of truce he criedThis time it was the other man whorepliedCapn Silver sir to come on boardand make terms he

not the slightest desire to talk toyou If you wish to talk to me jou cancome thats all If theres any treachery itll be on your side and the Lordhelp youThats enough capn shouted LongJohn cheerily A word from yousenough I know a gentleman and youmay lay to thatWe could see the man who carried theflag of truce attempting to hold Silver back nor was that wonderful seeing how cavalier had been the captains answer But Silver laughed athim aloud and slapped him on theback as if the idea of alarm had beenabsurd Then he advanced to thestockade threw over his crutch got aleg up and with great vigor and skillsucceeded in surmounting the fenceand dropping safely to the other sideI will confess that I was far too muchtaken up with what was going on tobe of x4he slightest use as sentry indeed I had already deserted my easternloophole and crept up beliindthecaptain who had now seated himselfm thethreshold with his elbows on his kneeshis head in his hands and his eyes fixedon the water as it bubbled out of theold iron kettle in the sand He waswhistling to himself Come Lassesand LadsSilver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll With the steepnessof the incline the thick tree stumpsand the soft sand he and his crutchwere as helpless as a ship in stays Buthe stuck to it like a man in silence andat last arrived before the captain whomhe saluted in the handsomest styleHe was tricked out in his best an immense blue coat thick with brass buttons hune as low as to his knees ands for the first though we were about f a fine Laced hat was set on the back ofhalf a mile away we could hear themroaring and singing late into the nightand as for the second the doctor stakedhis wig that camped where thejwercin the marsh and unprovidededies the half of them would be ontheir backs before

handy with a hand spikeend And Ill not deny either but whatsome of my people was shook maybeall was shook maybe I was shook myself maybe thats why Im here forterms But you mark me capn itwont do twice

soonerId a caught you at the act I wouldHe wasnt dead when I got round tohim not heWell says Capt Smollett as coolas can beAll that Silver said was a riddle tohim but you would never have guessedit from his tone As for me I began tohave an inkling Ben Gunns last wordscame back to my mind I began tosuppose that he had paid the buccaneers a visit while they all lay drunktogether around their fire

dominant featureOne could not sit in it and he unconscious of their presence Miss Mariacounted them her greatest worldly possessionMrs Antrims gaze was longinglyfastened upon themYou see Maria she was saying- Iam fixing up a colonial room Everything in it is to belong to the times before or just after the revolution Ihave some chairs that they say used tobelong to the Randolphs and twotables that were the Winthrops and aclock it stands as high as the ceilingthat belonged originally to a cousinof the Wnynes Then I have a spinning wheel and a lot of things in pewter and silver I have those on thedearest old sideboard They have allcost a lot of money 1 assure you anair of importance on her plump featuresXo doubt grimly assented MissMariaYes went on her visitor conrplaeentlyi but I dont mind that Iwant my room to be nicer than the onethe Hunts have just had arrangedThey have an armchair that they sayused to be in George Washingtonshall They are so set up about itIsow if I had those candlesticks Icould boast as much as thev do Theyhavent any candlesticks Ive just setmy heart on them Theres not anotherpair equal to them anywhere aroundMiss Maria smiled coldly Youknow Ive told you before that I wouldnot sell themI know but I thought perhapsMrs Antrim wanted to say Now thatyou seem so badly off you might beglad of the money -but she did notdare with Miss Marias severe gazebent upon her So she ended her senteicurather lamelj with perhaps youwouftT change your minduWhy should I change my mindasccf Miijs Maria bluntly Her visitorhesitated and said with a little heightening of

ofmoneyNow Maria you neednt get huffyabout it I suppose if you wont youwont said Mrs Antrim risingwith an air of offended dignity and arustle of her silk skirtsThats it I wont returned MissMaria grimly rising also The twowomen were strongly contrasted MrsAntrim plump fresh colored andbrown hair her rich furs and handsome gown giving evidence of worldlyprosperity Miss Maria thin worngray a cotton gown faded and wellmended falling around her in scantyfoldsMrs Antrim stood a momentwhenshe reached the door her hand on theknob Well if you should changeyour mind she said with a backwardglance at the mantel just let meknowMiss Maria made no reply except tobid here a cold gocd eveningShe stood at the window andwatched her departing visitor as shepassed down the path to the gate andto her carriageThe early winter evening was closingin Miss Maria drew down the blindsstirred the logs that were smolderingin the cavernous fireplace and seatedherself in the cane rocker in front of itA blaze sprang up suddenly brightening the homely room and increasingthe splendor of the brass candlesticksMiss Maria regarded them thoughtfully as she rocked slowly back andforth She had a feeling of satisfaction in seeing them there They had notgone to adorn Lucindas fine houseFor a moment she had been temptedHeaven and herself alone knew howmuch the 50 offered meant to herbut it was only an instant thatshe had wavered and Lucinda shouldnever know it The latter had spokentruly there was not another pair toequal them Well Lucinda must havesome disappointments Life had gonevery smoothly with herNo she would not sell those candlesticks poor as she was Her mindwent back to the long past youthto the family gatherings the merrymakings and how always the candlesticks had been one of the importantfeatures They had been her grandmothers who had received them fromher mother and she had had them inthe old colonial daysThe room grew dim as the flame dieddown Miss Maria arose with a sighand went out into the kitchen to prepare her supperMeanwhile at her tea table MrsAntrim was giving her husband an account of her call Its so provokingThose candlesticks are just lost in hermean little house And they wouldmake that room perfect I have neverseen any candlesticks to compare withthem They used to say that old MrsHenshaws grandmother brought themover in the MayflowerWell her grandmother did live inPlymouth The family was alwaysvery proud of them I should thinkMaria would be glad to sell them nowthat she is so poor But she alwayswas queerI wonder if that nephew of hers isout of the penitentiary yet said MrAntrimHe was sentenced to three yearsPoor Maria she has had ahard lifethat boy that she had brought up froma baby turned out so badly and thenloaing nearly ali of her properly Shecant have more than a couple of hundred dollars a year left I dont seehow she lives I wonder how she managesFrequently that winter did MissMaria wonder about- the same thingTimes were hard and she found itdifficult to procure the sewing withwhich for several years she had ekedout her slender income Often as herglance fell on the candlesticks did thetemptation to accept Mrs Antrimsoffer assail her But she would sether lips firmly and think No neverOne evening in March she had justcleared awajr her supper table and wasresting before her sitting room fire Itwas later than her usual hour for thatmeal for she had been finishing somesewing the first she had had in severalweeksA faint and hesitating knock came tothe door Miss Maria arose and openedit It was dark and rainy She couldsee no oneWho is there she asked sharplyA figure moved into the light streaming from the door Mits Maria repeated her questionIts me Aunt Maria said a huskyvoice and the figure came nearer MissMaria retreated a stepYou Martin What do you wantshe demanded sternlyIve no place to go I just got outlast week and Ive been tramping eversinceAnd you dare come hereIm tired out Im hungryAnd you

movingawayMartin she called You may stayto night Come in moving back fromthe door that he might enterHe was a youth of some 20 years thinhaggard his hair unkept and hisclothes disordered and weather wornHe took off his battered old hat andstood trembling before Mihs Mariasawful gazeYoure a fine sight she said slowly and contemptuously as her eyesscanned him from head to footThe water was dripping off from hiswet clothes and formed little pools onher spotless floor She stood a fewmoments regarding the wretched figura then moved quicklv over to thefireSit down and dry yourself shecommanded pushing a chair in frontof the flameThe young follow obeyed shiveringlie bent over Ihe blazing logs whileMiss Maria went out into the kitchenShe stirred up the fire in the stoveIt was almost out but

coming away he gaveme a letter to his brother in New Yorkthat he said would help me to get workand to make a new startHe took a letter from his breast pocket and handed it to his auntMiss Marias face

IrrigatedThe shores of the Mississippi river below New Orleans are lined with gardens in which grow luxuriantly amy raid of fruits and vegetables Thisis accomplished by a very odd method ofirrigationNear the mouth of the river on thesouth bank in the delta country is anarrow strip of land not more than1000 yards wide in places in which itis said the best oranges in the countrymay be grown There is no levee butthe waters have so wide an expanse thatthe annual freshets do not cover theland as would be the case higher uiwhere the river is narrower and wherethe levies are a vital necessity Beyondthe narrow strip of land that marks thisside of the river are innumerablebayous and canebrakes and swamps Inthese bayous lurked the long low rakish craft of the pirate Lafitte in thegood old days The country is inhaHtedby Creoles of the most primitive typewho live by raising fruit fishing andoystering The narrcw strip of orangecountry is worth 300 fu acreHigher up the river tin the same sideas New Orleans is approached are milesafter miles of truck gardens and smallfruit farms blooming and fresh andgreen from the water drawn to themfrom the Mississippi river The methodof

BottlesThere has been considerable talk inPhiladelphia relative to the efforts ofsome to have the bottling of milkstopped and to return to the old dipmilk system of delivery The objections advanced were that as the bottlesgo from house to house and as diseaseand contaminating- influences maj surround the bottles in some of the manyplaces where they are delivered theymight be the carriers of disease Thisobjection is by no means a bad oneand everyone handling milk in bottlesshould see that proper precautions aretaken to avoid trouble from this sourceAt least 90 per cent of the milk handledin bottles today runs considerable riskin this direction as the general customA fcKv miRACK FOR MILK BOTTLESis simply to collect the bottles promiscuously get them all into a tub ofsoaped water of some character washone bottle after another with the samebrush put them in a rinse water all torget her then into the cases and put thedirty covers down leaving the bottlesopen and giving opportunity for thedust and dirt from the covers or botirs of the old cases to drop into thebottlesWith just a little more trouble andwith but a very slight expense the bottles can be so handled that there needbe no trouble whatever from anjr ofthe objections offered in the line of thebottles being possible carriers of disease germs Every dairj no matterLow small is incomplete without theuse of steam and when a dairy isequipped with this it is but alittlemoreexpense to have a sterilizer built Thisneed be only a simple wooden structure and be made to suit the space athand It can be so arranged that asthe bottles are brought in they can immediately be put in the sterilizer carehaving been taken that the bottles havebeen carefully rinsed at the placeswhere they have been collected by thecustomers After the bottles have beensterilized they can then be washed indie alkaline hot water and then rinsedan two other waters great care beintaken in the last rinse water used thisshould be frequently changedAfter the bottles are rinsed theyshould again be placed in the sterilizerand subsequently aired and sunned justns milk cans are treated A system by-which the dust is kept out and the airallowed to circulate freely is by theuse of a rack as shown in the cut Thisbottle rack may be so made that it canbe run right into the sterilizer thencethe bottles can be easily put in goodcirculating air and then brought to themost convenient place for filling Thisrack may be made to hold 400 bottlesor less or more if necessary Withthese precautions the possibility of conveying disease through the medium ofthe bottles is very slight and the dairyman will find that the increased confidence placed in him by his customerswill help his trade materially RuralNew

itsriddance are well known but continuedinquiries as to the cause of decay of immature plum fruit showthe necessityfor repetition The chief enemy of theplum is the insect curculio and its ravages for awhile caused a cessation ofplanting this fruit in many sections butwith a little attention such as all fruitswill require serious trouble can beavoided and perfect fruit had Perhapsthe oldest plan for ridding the trees ofthe pest is to violently jar the treeswith a small padded log from time totime after the leaves have appearedwhen the insects would first appear Asheet arranged beneath the treescatches the insects that fall by thejarring and they are thus collected anddestroyed At this period the matureinsect in the form of a beetle is atwork feeding on the leaves If let alonethe real destruction is begun as thefruit is set when eggs are depositedtherein in great numbers it is said atthe rate of ten a day by each femaleEven in small private orchards it is nowbeing- found advantageous to resort tothe spraying of all fruit trees and bymany it will be found equally convenient to use this method of destroying these insects A solution of thewell known Bordeaux mixture and diluted paris green would be effectivein this case and would at the sametime act upon any fungus that mightbe present Many of our private gardens lack the plum one of the 7nost delicious family fruits merely because ofthis little difficulty which is really notas great as is usually considered Theadvent of the Japanese varieties whichhave not thus far been found out bythe curculio has to a degree lent encouragement to the planter but thereare some of the old varieties that couldnot well be replaced and it will befound profitable to give a little care tothem rather than sacrifice their

with arctio goloshes and a warm knittedwaistcoat he is seen upon the links onnany a day which appears inclement tothe uninitiated Perhaps this disregardof snow ani ice is natural when onecomes to look up the derivation of golfing terms Many of the words comeIeucly from the Icelandic languagesSwedish lynka meaning a twistor crook hence itsannlication to tho- windings of the coast the sandy barrenground called links in ScotlandTo put pronounced putt comesfrom the Gaelic put signifying topush or throw as when the useful putter propels the golf ball from theputting green into the holeThe lofter is derived from the Icelandic loft that is shy or air aDanish form being loft for ceiling orloft Philadelphia InquirerOne Tcteran Witlioat a PensionI sat on a hill with a sergeant whoknew
