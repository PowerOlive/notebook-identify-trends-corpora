Re-pablicaus and One or Two Democrats and One PopulistWashington July 21 The indications when the senate adjourned Tuesday were that a vote would be reachedupon the conference report on thetariff bill some time during Thursdayor at the latest before the close ofthe week There may be a change inthe conditions which will postpone avote but it is difficult to see whatcould cause it The opposition to thebill realize that there is no possibilityof preventing adoption of the reportand their present purpose is only tosecure what advantage they can byexhibiting- what they claim are the inconsistencies of the measure It is truethat at one time they had some hope ofbeing able to secure the recommittalof the bill but a thorough canvass re-veals no foundation for this hope Itdevelops the fact that tbe Republicanswill vote solidly for the report and thatthey will be supported by MessrsJonesof Nevada silver republican andMcEnery of Louisiana democrat andalso probably Messrs Mantle and Stewart silver republicans They have alsodiscovered that Senator Kyle popwho is absent has left strict instructions that he should not be pairedWith the adoption of the report thusassured the democrats probably willnot attempt to prolong the debate beyondthe arrival of Mr Turley thenew senator from Tennessee Theywill continue to ask for an explanation of changes made by the conference but these will not occupy a greatdeal of timeThe general opinion is that thequorum of the senate will disappearvery soon after the disposal of the tariff bill but the determination of thesupporters of the Harris Pacific railroad resolution to secure a vote uponit before final adjournment may delaythat consummation for some daysWashington July 21 Representative Mitchell of New York has introduced in the house a bill

with theresinous smell of old field pines blew inat the open windows of the car andThorndyke lying- back in his seat withhalf closed eyes tried once more to setin their proper order the events of thelast few days in New York There wasno particular reason why they shouldbe assorted and labeled save one thememory of them seemed to be slippingaway from him There were timeswhen he could not be sure that he hadsigned his will when he could not remember what he had said to his motherat parting- And as for that patheticlittle scene in the dimly lightedat the Morrissons it mighthave happened ten years before Heasked himself if it were possible that itwas only two days since he had chokedin trying- to say good by to Helen Itwas beyond belief the miles of distancehad somehow become transmuted intoyears of time and the memory of thatevening- only two evenings ago was already beginning- to fade Was it onlybecause the change of scene and of encompassment pushed the things of yesterday aside to make room for newerimpressions or did the reason lie in thegrim fact of irrevocability Thorndyke pursued these reflections so farinto the field of abstractions that theman in the next seatspoke twice beforehe g ot an answer1 beg- your pardon Philip saidcoming- back to actualities with a reluctant effort What did you sayI asked if you were going- up to Allacoochee said the

ofprosperity continued the light Aventout of the sky and it was quite darkwhen the brakeman thrust his face intothe car to call AllacoocheeThorndyke gathered up his belongings with a sigh of relief

knew Europe rather betterthan he did his own county As theomnibus jounced along over the unpaved streets Thorndyke amused himself by picturing the probable contrastbetween the backwoods tavern and itshigh sounding appellation He wasrather more than surprised thereforewhen the omnibus stopped in front ofa three storied building standing ina park like inclosure and ablazewith gas and electric lights and astonishment rose into admiration whena liveried servant ushered him into themagnificent rotunda floored with marble mosaic and wainscoted in quartersawed oak Everything about the placewas

say the coaland iron the lack of important manufacturing centers in the south and theconsequent pressing need for one justhere the climate and a hundred otherthings besidesAre the coal and iron realitiesOh yes very much so this mountain behind the hotel is a vast coal bedand that one over there pointing tothe cliffs across the Little Chiwasseeis equally rich in iron of fair qualityThen the

fire clay timber coal and ironIf a city may be built upon the merepresence of raw material Allacoocheeis a fact accomplishedThat implies a doubt may I ask thereasonCertainly though Im not at all sureI can make it plain All the advantagesI have named and a dozen more are hereto be sure but theyve always been hereand it remained for our friends the promoters to find out that they would warrant all this including the visible partof Allacoochee by a comprehensive ges sture More than that the same advantages may be found in plenty of localities in the south some of themmuch more accessible than this valleyAnd then I have an old fashioned ideathat cities cant be created arbitrarilyThey smoked in silence for a littlewhile and then Thorndyke took a cardfrom his case and handed it to his

laughed Ill have to confessthat my plans are a trifle indefinite Ihad an idea that perhaps I might gointo the woods with the lumbermen orthe turpentine gatherersYoure still too far north for thatthere are no lumber camps or turpentineforests in this part of the state and ifthere were I hardly think the life wouldbe what you want Your trouble ispulmonaryYes pulmonaryProtheroe reflected for a

please go onI should say that you might find outwhat it will do for you by getting boardat some farmhouse in the valley Youcould put in your time tramping aboutand the scenery would give you an object There is only one difficultyWhat is thatFarmhouses where you can get anything to eat besides bacon and cornpone are not plentiful in this part of thecountryHaving his recent experience with therailway eating houses before himi Philip shuddered Im willing- torough it he said -but Im not anxiousto add dyspepsia to my other ailmentsDont you suppose I could find a placewhere the bill of fare wouldnt be quiteno limitedYoull find very few of them inthis mountain region roughly speaking there are only two classes of whitepeople a small minority of well-to-doplanters and farmers and a large majority of poor folkThats rather discouraging and yetit seems as if I ought to be able to findwhat I need I dont expect much inthe way of accommodations Id besatisfied with good plain country boardsuch as we get

cable was laidand all the trouble believed to be atan end but the orthodox Moor nothaving been subsidized as had been hisroyal master conceived that both hisfeelings and his religion had been outraged by the Christian dogs Accordingly one dark night he went downto the beach and cut the cable with anax The line was repaired but whenever any Arab had a grievance againstthe hated foreigner lie immediately applied his efforts to destroy the cableIt was repaired three times when thecompany resolved upon this expedientOne dark night the cable was taken upand carried underground to the officeand a dummy cable was laid in plainsight for a few hundred feet The device was successful and although MrMoor often took occasion to chop thedummy to pieces for a long time thewhereabouts of the true cable was unknownThe international lighthouse on CapeSpartel at the entrance to Gibraltarstraits is one of the points of interestin this neighborhood It is supportedby themaritime nations of the

mornirig ateompanied by twoEnglish acquaintances and an interpreter and guide a Spanish Jew thewriter set forth to visit this celebrated lightAfter two hours of rough riding wedrew up at the lighthouse terraceJr where the keeper a pleasant old German furnished refreshment for manand beast We then spent an hour ortwo inspecting the lighthouse and looking through the big telescope by whichall vessels are sightedOne of my English friends had heardof some wonderful caves situated upon- the Atlantic side and much againstthe advice of our host and the guideTangiers by a roundabout

ou Id be extremely hazardous It isflangerous for a foreigner to go a mileoutside the city limits after nightfallwithout a soldier and many travelersby so doing have been robbed somelimeslosing their liyesJBut the Englishman was determinedfor having a kodak he purposed getting some views of these nearly unknown caves After some hard ridingover rough mountain paths the loosestones flying from under our mulesfeet and in some places so steep thatwe were obliged to dismount and leadour animals we came upbn two shepherds who were smoking by a springLearning from them that the caveswere several miles beyond and as it wasgetting late in the day we thought itprudent to take the path for homeWe had not gone more than twomiles when we arrived before a smallcollection of shepherd huts and tentsin front of which a number of womenand children were seated Stopping toinquire the road and to refresh ourmules with spring water the Englishman thought to obtain pictures of thiswild and picturesque groupNow among the country Arabs thereis a strong supersition regarding thecamera they looking upon the lens asthe Evil Eye and believing that one atwhom itis directed will be bewitchedand certain to suffer from some calamityOur guide seeing the Englishmanunslingthe camera called to him to desist and we having heard of this superstition whicli amounts to fanaticism added our protests but in vainand no sooner did the women see thekodak leveled at them than they set upa fearful shrieking and turned to runfor the houses At the sound of theircries from nearly every rock and busha man sprang into view and rushedtoward us The Englishman thinkingto appease them held up a Spanish dollar to the fleeing women but the menmistaking his motive believed it to bean insult to their wives and gatheringstones began to pelt us from a distanceOur guide cried for us to mount andride for our lives and indeed we neededno other encouragement At the firstvolley the camera was hopelesslyruined and for one I was heartily gladAway we went at a breakneck gallopend our mules being struck by flyingstones and worried by the fierce dogsof the shepherds were soon unmanageableNageable The trail being so narrowthat but one mule might pass at a timeI had the post of honor if it may be socalled being well in the rear theguide was far ahead with the Englishman who had caused all the troublea close secondDuring that ride I enjoyed much thesame sensations as the renowned Gilpinmay have experienced my legs flyingin the air and clutching wildly at thepommel of the high Arab saddle TheArabs are notoriously fleet of foot andfollowed us in a howling mob Our pacewas so rapid that it destroyed their aimbut I was struck several times in theAWAY WE WENTback and once in the head the lastnearly knocking me from my muleThe Arabs pursued us for about fivemiles till at last Ave heard their crieagrow fainter in the distance and finallycease It was a sorry band that haltedabout two miles farther pn to repairdamages I was the greatest suffererbeing so lame that I could hardly sit mymuleOur guide informed us that our greatest danger had lain from the path being so circuitous and precipitous forthe Arabs might easily have run aheadover the hills and thetry have headed us off We wereobliged to travel very slowly for therest of the way to avoid holes and pitfalls and darkness falling suddenly asit does in this climate we made poorprogress At last however the lightsof Tangier appeared in the distanceand we were soon at our hotelThe landlord to whom we recountedthe adventure assureckus that our

spontaneously has never been determined Usually the fire has originated where considerable quantities of clover hay havebeen stored In nearly every case thestacks or buildings were entirety- consumed so it was irqgxjssible to determine the origin of the fire At the Pennsylvania experiment station barns inlb95 fire was seen dropping from theceiling of the cow stableInvestigation proved that the fire wasconfined to a mow of hay 1Sx23 andabout 23 feet high The draughts werestopped and the top of the mow keptcovered with wet blankets Openingswere made in the sdes of the barn andall the hay about 30 tons was pitched jout une removing mis cue jsnurecenter of the mow was smouldering andready tb Nburst into flames when exposed to the air Fortunately a hydrantwas near at hand and the top was keptconstantly saturated and the barn thussaVed All the center of the mow wasthoroughly packed hot and smokingThe high temperature of the hay madedt decidedly uncomfortable for thosewho were removing the smoulderingtfodderThe holes burned through the mowfloor were above the middle of the stable and not near the walls It was evident that the fire could not have beenaccidental or incendiary The hay wassecond growth clover and timothymostly cloverv and when harvested wasthought to be in unusually fine condition The fact that it was very compact gave color to the theory that thjcombustion was spontaneous Examination of the hay after being thrownout of the barn showed that a largeproportion of it was so thoroughlycharred that it would crumble whenhandled Some if it had not been subjected to so great a heat and was onlybrown in color but was wholly unfitfor stockFor several days previous to the firea peculiar odor had been noticed aboutthe barn and examination seemed to indicate that the rowen was heating butthere were no indications of fire Theodor soon became ho strong that it waacompared by some to that of burninggrain While positive proof as to theorigin of this fire may be lacking thecircumstances are such that it is safeto consider it spontaneous AmericanAgriculturistABOUT EARTHWORMSHow they Maintain the Living Layer of Vecretable MoldA discussion on the subject of earthworms and vegetable mold appearedin a recent issue of Longmans Magazine The writer Grant Allen statesthat it was Gilbert White of Selbornewho first of all pointed out the importance of earthworms as producers andmaintainers of living layers of vegetable mold It was the patient investigatibhsof Darwin however whichfully established the fact and raised itto the rank of a scientific discoveryhis first writing on the subject appearing in the Gardeners Chronicle Laterhe issued an entire book on this interesting matter Darwin showed thatearthworms act upon the soil in threeways In the first place thejr open upand loosen the ground for the roots topenetrate more perfect aeration of thesoil being thus obtained The acidsthey secrete also act chemically uponthe layer of rocks beneath in a way thatassists the disintegration of the latterIn the second place they crush intheir gizzards small fragments ofstone and liberate their component elements In the third place they dragdown into their burrows countlessnumbers of leaves which they eat andcariy up the refuse to the surface Itis computed that no fewer than 5300Qworms inhabit an acre of garden soilThese worms pass through their bodiesteir tons of material in a year andthrow it up as mold at the rate of oneinch in depth every five years Thegreater part of the mold is composedof a refuse of vegetable matter and isteeming with myriads of bacteriaEven after allowing for other cooperating causes earthworms are responsible for the formation and renewal ofthis layer of vegetable moldGARDEN TOOLCHLSTilt -Saves Hundreds of Stens

leaking through thestained and discolored staves halfsalted and over salted goods undercolored and over colored butter butterfresh and butter old and altogether unpleasant to look upon all these andmore were presented to us for purchaseWhen we came -on the farm we determined to make the best butter we couldand offer it for sale only in the mostattractive form possible My wife hadthe advantage of having been born ona farm and further of having had fora mother an excellent butter makerand our goods were always good Butter made in the summer would standuntil the next spring without injuryWe used the very best oak tubs andtook every possible pains to have ourbutter salted properlyRecently we ha ve procured a buttercarrier with trays etc and a fine printButter put up in this way presents

dispose of all Ihad on hand and at something abovethe market price One man took a lotwithout tasting or even smelling it buthe had had some before and knew whatit was- This method of putting up butter wecontinued until June when we began toput it down in tubs for storing untilnext fallIt is not strange to me that so muchbutter is sold at a low figure when I seehow absoluely inferior much of it isThere would be a decided irnprovemencall around if everyone used the greatestpossibJe care from milking to marketing to do their work thoroughly andwell If those who do not exercise thiscare could be compelled to buy for ayear or two I believe their eyes wouldthen be opened to the great value ofneatness in the dairy E L Vincentin Western RuralWhy Eggs Should Be WashedWhen eggs come to market

an interesting legend concerning the manner in whichthe Methuselah of theirmythology got the better of SatanTong- lived 1000 years and acquiredgreat wisdom The latter years of hislife were spent in fishing but not wishing to diminish the stock of fish in theriver he used a straight piece of wTireinstead of a hook Thus he was ableto enjoy the excitement and pleasureof fishing for several centuries withoutcatching a single fishRealizing that sooner or later thedevil who did deaths errands would blooking him up he changed his nameand abode with each generation andthus eluded him u the meautimethe evil one disguised himself m aflowing Corean robe which covered uphis tail concealed his horns under amourners hat three feet in diameterand wrapped his legs in curious paddedstockings so that he easily passed fora native lie heard that Tong wasfishing in the Hau river So he collected a quantit3r of charcoal andwashed it in that stream This ofcourse blackened the water and Tongbeing surprised and annoyed went upto discover the cause Finding thedevil washing Ihe charcoal he askedwhat he was doing The devil repliedthat he was trying to make it whiteOld Tong in his astonishment wasthrown off hisguard and said Thavelived in Corea hundreds of years andof course have met many fools but Inever saw a big enough fool to itry towash charcoal whiteThe devil at once knew his man andunfolding his tail by way of exhibiting his warrant of arrest seized Tongand hurried him along in the directionof the dark portals through which allmortals must passOn the way the devil being in goodhumor over his success chatted pleasantly with Tong who ventured to askhim what he most abhorred and wasmost afraid of The devil made a fatal blunder one which might havebeen excusable for si mortal he toldthe truth He said he hated and fearedbut four terrestial tilings a branch ofa thorn tree an empty salt bag aworn out straw sandal an ox and aparticular kind of grass that grows inCorea the foxtail and that whenthese were put together he could notgo within 30 feet of them-In return the devil asked Tong wrhathe most feared Tong being wise andexperienced lied and said he was inmortal terror of a roasted ox head andmackalee a kind of beerShortly after the exchange of confidence Tong noticed that they werepassing a thorn tree around the rootsof which foxtail grass was growingand curiously enough under it was anold salt bag and a cast off ox caudalso making a sudden spring from theside of the devil he gathered up thebag the brass and sandal and hangingthem on the branchy of the tree hischarm- wasperfect Thcdevdl could Jiotcome within 30 feetOf course the devil used every inducement to get Tong to come forthbut the old fellow stuck to his post Atlast the devil went off and got a roastedox head and cask of mackalee androlled them in to Tong confident fromwhat he had told liim that Tong wouldbe driven outside the magic circle Butwhen he saw Tong eating heartily ofthe beef and drinking the mackaleewith gusto he realized that the gamewas up and despairingly departedTongs long life was due to the accident by which his page in the Book ofPate stuck to the next one so that hisname was overlooked When ultimately the complaint was made that Tonghad lived too long it took the registrarof the lower regiops 34G 3Tears to huntup his name in the archives ChicagoRecordThe Danger Side of Lightning IlodsThe conventional lightning rods thatone sees over houses and barns In thecountiy and small towns afford but little protection to the buildings Smallas this security is it is Avholly lost ifthe so called conductors are improperlyconstructed and not in perfect orderwhen they in fact become an absolute menace to the building they arereared to guard It is essential if theconventional rod is to be set up thatthe work be intrusted to reliable andcapable persons otherwise it may become a shining invitation to dangersIt is probable therefore all things considered that a building is as well if notbetter protected without such conductors as are in general use as withthem It is safe to assert that the greatmajority of buildings damaged or destroyed by lightning were providedwith lightning rods and in the majority of these eases the conductors invitedthe thunderbolts and for some causeprobably improper construction coulcnot lead the lightning harmlessly to

of theKruezlingen post office and the date18130 The lucky finder asks 2500 francsfi00 for the envelopeBefore stamps came into use postagewas paid aver the counter to the postmaster and the amount written on theenvelope It is amusing to hear thatpeople of high social standing did notconsider a postage stamp an ornamentto a letter and preferred to pay thepostage in money Pamily crests andBtamps on one and the same letter wasa sign of poor taste in those daysWhen the first perforated issueUnited States 1855 60 came upon thescene some post offices had large quantities of the 1851 imperforates
