IN THE HINTERLAND A WOMAN THE STAKE
WEALTH OF WEST AFRICA THAT SHE WAS PLAYED AGAINST50000 IN
FRANCE AND ENGLAND ARE AFTER A GAME OF ECARTE
The Tradesmen of llio Two European Though the Kentuckian Won at the Game
Countries Are Kn jajred In a Struggle He Was Beaten In Another Way Strange
For Conquest Which May Call For Story cf en Old Grcwsomo booking
nitration to Prevent a War J House In San Francisco
Jaincs Pinnock African merchant of
Liverpool who was one of the original
promoters of the Royal Niger company
and director for many years in the
course of an interview with a represent
ative of The Daily Mail said I went
out to west Africa 40 years ago and vis
it ed almost every port and place in that
region including the Nigor many
times and my business has been with
west Africa ever aince In IS 70 I built
a storracr called the Rio Formoso spe
cially for service on the river Niger and
with her I explored and opened up for
the first time in history the river For
cados This river flows into the Atlantic
and is one of the entrances to the Niger
The importance of this great river
Niger and the hinterland is well known
to those who are engaged in the African
trade but we can only expect it will
slowly dawn on the mind of the British
public I am convinced however the
more they look intc it the more impor
tant they will see it is to the interests of
British trade not to lose any of it
Fifteen years ago there were four
firms trading on the Niger They were
the West African company the Central
African Trading company and with
this latter Taubman Bros one of them
now Sir Taubman Goldie were con
nected Miller Bros and myself We
all four firms joined and called ourselves
the United African company which
was subsequently changed to tho Na
tional African company and after that
again to the Royal Niger company
The position today continued Mr
Pinnock would be better understood
if a good map could be put before the j
puuuc oi me wxioie iiiutuijauu ui uui
west African colonies Such a thing un
fortunately does not exist at present
The strict geography of the country is
only understood by a very few On
knowledge of the hinterland however
has increased immensely during the past
few years and to instance one particu
larly large territory I would point out
that the French flag is already flying at
innumerable towns and stations extend
ing from 4 degrees east longitude to 2
degrees west longitude and from about
G degrees north latitude in the neigh
borhood of Porto Novo and the Daho
mey country to the town of Say on the
Niger which is between 13 degrees and
14 degrees north The English flag is to
be found to the east of Porto Novo and
extending inland to the neighborhood
of Nikki now occupied by the French
to various degrees of latitude wherein
are found the three British possessions
and protectorates of Lagos the Niger
Coast protectorate and the Royal Nigei
company
It is from the interior however
that the future great wealth of Africa
will be derived and if all this is allow
ed to fall into the lap of France she
will be possessed of an empire second
only if not equal in tho future to thf
whole of our Indian empire
See what South Africa has already-
developed into and as far only as min
erals are concerned The soil of Africa
has not yet been barely scratched The
population of this part of Africa with
the advent of railways stoppage of the
slave trade cessation of internal tribal
warfare will increase in equal ratio t
that of the most favored parts of the
southern states of America I mean as
far as the multiplication of the negro
population is concerned
The development of this hinterland
will in my opinion exceed all the
dreams of the most enthusiastic coloni
al party in France Both France and
England have sacrificed many men and
much money in the race to grasp this
priceless treasure and the difficulty of
apportioning it will believe be so
great that it is more than probable to
avert extremes it will have to be re
ferred to some other nation or council
of nations to arbitrate on as the mat
ter is far too weighty for easy or speedy
settlement
As evidence of the activity of the
French I may point to the railway from
Senegal to the upper Niger This is
being pushed forward with a further
vote of 1000000 francs from theCaiss
des Depots et Consignations thus cut
ting and heading off all our possessions
from Gambia Sierra Leone the Gold
Coast and Lagos down to the river
Niger
A very great deal if not the whole
of the trouble on the Niger added Mr
Pinnock would never have arisen but
for the obnoxious charter given to the
Royal Niger company By reason of
this charter every trader white and
black British or otherwise is entirely
excluded from the country Had the
river and adjacent country been thrown
open to free and legitimate trade as all
merchants have been clamoring so long
for backed up by the chambers of com
merce of Liverpool and Manchester all
the places in question would have long
since been full of British subjects white
and colored Trade would have devel
oped a thousandfold and the French
would never have gone near it Lou

Pall Mall Gazefite
In 18G7 there stood an old fashioned
shanty cast of the locality now occupied
by tho Presentation convent in front of j
the graveyard and the people in the
neighborhood used to tell trLigc stones
about this grewsoine looking dwelling
For several years its occupancy was ap
parently confined to a decrepit old man
who used to crawl in and out about onc8
a day his arms filied with packages
from the market
He was known in the neighborhood as
the old dago though in reality he was
a native of Alsace For several years he
lived a hermits life and the neighbors
got so accustomed to his comings and
goings that even the small boys forgot
to molest him But one morning all the
gossips found food for conversation by
the appearance of a remarkably lovely
young woman who went out to and re
turned from the butchers stall and the
grocers She spoke English imperfectly
and with a very pronounced French
accent This little cabin was destined
to be the scene of a very dramatic inci
dent in the history of California gam
bling
It was natural that a girl as pretty as
Irene should not be long without ad
mirers so it came to pass that the win
dows of the old house were lighted up
svery evening and the Frenchman de
veloped the natural hospitality of his
race and gave little dinners and suppers
to his exiled countrymen But among
those as was only natural there were
some who existed not by honest
try but by the gaming tabie Among
them was a young man of striking ap
pearance who had served in France as
sous officier in a hussar regiment had
gone the pace ruined himself and final
ly drifted out to San Francisco where
he became the hanger on of the gambling
table
Louis Le Marrouais was a strikingly
handsome specimen of the Parisian of
his class It did not take him very long
to gain the confidence of tho old French
man and to him he confided the story
of his life It was not a very eventful
one He was a member of an old French
family and could use if he pleased a
title which dated back to Charles the
Bold He had been ruined by the ex
travagance of his younger brother and
was then living on the income of a lit
tle property in Brittany which he had
saved from the wreck Irene was his
only child and he idolized her For her
sake alone he wTanted to be rich He
wanted to take her back to France and
reinstate her in the position to which
her rank entitled her
- The ex hussar won the oilman into
the belief that his only chance of getting
rich was through gambling So night
after night old Lescant was found at
the El Dorado or some other gaming
hell losing his money under the direc
tion of the arch mentor One night Irene
followed him there to bring him back
vid her first visit was a fateful one
Tom Monroe a Kentuckian one of the
wildest and most reckless characters of
that period saw her admired her and
swore that she should become his prop
erty
It is not necessary to recite the inci
dents that led up to the scene which
were related to me by an eyewitness It
is sufficient to say that Le Marronais
bad convinced the old Frenchman that
Monroo would stake 50000 against
the hand of Irene If he won she was
to become his wife but if he lost the
money was to become the Frenchmans
property and Irene was free to bestow
her affections wherever she pleased
Irene was informed of this proposition
and she looked resigned and rather
amused at the transaction
The eventf al night arrived Monroe
tho old man Louis Irene and a friend
and countryman of the host were the
only inmates of the little room Tho
game was ecrte and the cards which
Louis had marked lay upon the table
The old man got the deal Monroes cer
tified check for 50000 was placed in
the custody of the hussar The old man
marked the king in the first deal and
when the pack changed hands he had
the best of the game The play went on
and in thelaat hand Monroe scored every
point
Irene is mine shouted the Ken
tuckian reaching for his check
At this moment the lights were dashed
out and Monroe fell to the floor from
the stroke of some heavy instrument
The only disinterested spectator of the
scene fled from the room The nes
morning there was no sign of life in the
old house and in the evening when tfes
milkman knocked he heard a groaning
from the inside He forced his way into
the house and discovered the wretched
Kentuckian bouncl iiand and foot Mon
roe avowing murder rushed the next
morning to the banking house The
check had been cashed by an individual
who answered the description of the
hussar The other actors in this star
ring scene were never heard of Nothing
la the house was disturbed not even
the girls wearing apparel and the inci
dent became a portion of this strange
history of old time gambling in San
