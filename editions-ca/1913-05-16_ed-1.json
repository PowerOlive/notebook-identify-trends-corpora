of the family since that time, though
he has kept in touch with them. He
is one of the old-time slave negroes,

a connecting link between the past

most prosperous negroes about Mil

ments in the next few weeks. Col.
Bain did not come as a stranger, as he
has stood before Millersburg audi
ences on numerous occasions. All
who attended were well pleased, al
though the shadows of time are
gathering about Col. Bain thick and
fast, and he is rapidly approaching his j
his fourth score milestone, his brain
is as active today as it was a half a
century ago. This lecture is his latest I
production and was filled with gems
of thought from his first utterances
to its close.

CONTRACTS LET
For Work on New Addition" to Bour-
i bon Warehouse.
Bids for the erection of an. addition
to the property of the Bourbon To
bacco Warehouse Co. in Barns Addi
tion, were received and opened at a
meeting of the Directors of the com
pany held at the Court House Tuesday
afternoon. The company received
estimates on the cost of a brick struc
ture seventy by two hundred and
seventy-two feet to be built adjoining
the old warehouse.
When completed the new house will
greatly enlarge the floor space, and a
basement has been provided for one
half of the new addition, which will
furnish ample space for the rehand
ling of the tobacco purchased in the
sales rooms.
When completed the amount of floor
space will be almost doubled and will
permit the receiving of enough to
bacco to insure sales every day. Work
on the excavations for the new struc
ture will be started at once and the
addition will be ready for occupancy
in time for the sales of tobacco this
fall. The contracts for the new build
ing were awarded as follows:
Steel work Southern Foundry Co.,
Owensboro, represented by January &
Connell, Pans.
Brick work George Deiterman,
Paris.
Lumber and carpenter work Bour
bon Lumber Co. and John Arkle,
Paris.
Roofing, sky lights, guttering, glass
and pipes January & Connell, Paris.
Concrete work and excavation Stu
art & O'Brien and Woods Bros, Paris.
The local warehouse company is
looking forward to one of the most
successful seasons during the coming
fall and winter and with the greatly
increased facilities will be able to
handle a larger quantity of tobacco
than any of the warehouses in this
section.
The fact that inadequate floor space
made it necessary to reduce the num
ber of sales each week to three, was
a considerable drawback, but with the
new addition, sales will be held each
day, and it is the opinion the majority
of the crop of Bourbon County this
year will find its way to his market.
Prices as good as those obtained on
any markets in Central Kentucky
were obtained last year and the grow
ers who consigned their crops to the
local warehouse were more than satis
fied as a result.
Street Oiling About Completed.
The oiling of the streets in this city
has about been completed and the
next few days will find all of the thor
oughfares covered with a coat of oil.
Mayor Hinton states that another tank
of oil will be received within the next
few days, when the city band will be
engaged in putting on the finishing
touches that are calculated to relieve
the citizens of the dust for the re
mainder of the summer.
For Summer Wear.
Men's, women's and children's low
shoes in tans and patent leather. Just

KENTUCKY BOYS
Will Help Erect Buildings at Camp
Daniel Boone.
The Central Kentucky Boys' Work
Committee have decided to let the
boys themselveshelp build their camp
Lodge and other buildings at Camp
Daniel Boone, and the boys have
taken much interest in the equipment
or the camp. The boys of Lexington
alone are raising almost S1.300 to-
vard the lodge building and now
that they are to help build the lodge
it will be much more really theirs
and the interest will be much more
intense. The Committee through its
Executive Secretary has made ar
rangements to have some twenty-five
or thirty of the older boys from the
Central Kentucky towns come to the
camp June 12, when the committee
will provide camp equipment, lead
ers and plenty of food without cost to
the boys. The mornings wil be spent
building the lodge, making floors for
the tents, and putting base ball, bas
ket ball and tennis courts in shape.
Thde afternoon will be devoted to rec
reation, such as base ball, basket ball,
tennis, swimming, fishing, etc.
The boys who want to enjoy this
camp should send in their applica
tion early. Any boy may apply, but
where other things are equal, pref
eTence will be given to those boys
who could not otherwise enjoy the
camp privileges.
The plans for the new lodge have
just been completed by Mr. Manley,
the well-known Lexington architect,
thus materially supplementing his
contribution to the camp fund. The
plans indicate the new lodge will be a
beauty and surrounded as it will be
by the beautiful woodland, it should
make an ideal vacation home. Mr.
Harris the camp manager, says: "We
become more enthusiastic about it
every day. As the leaves have come
out and the beautiful garden of wild
flowers, principally ' black hawes, lo
cust and dogwood, have bloomed just
back of us, and the pinks and arbutus
have lined the cliffs of Marble Creek,
its fltness has become more and more
apparent and I can imagine no more
beautiful spot."
The work camp begins June 12 and
closes June 21. The regular camp
opening June 23.
A very limited number of boys,
however, can provide part of theirex
penses for the regular periods as spec
ial assistants to the cook and caring
for the dishes, it having been decid
ed to abandon the idea of having the
boys wash their own dishes and pre
pare the vegetables.
More than 1,000,000 persons are em
ployed in the textile mills of Great
Britain.
