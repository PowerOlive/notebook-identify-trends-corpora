KENTUCKY TOBACCO EEP0RT
(Monthly Business Review)
The tobacco crop of Kentucky is
nearly all housed af the present
time. In some parts of the State
where the crop is late and the
drouth not so severe as to necessi
tate cutting the immature plants,
there is some tobacco still growing.
The Burley tobacco crop is a short
one this year; that is the yield per
acre is small, but even with a large
acreage it is doubtful whether the
total production will be as much if
any more than that of last year.
Last year's crop was one . of the
sm'allest for many years. Certainly
this year's crop in any event cannot
be "above the normal production.
The drouth forced very early cut
ting of most of the Burley tobacco
as Burley burns very readily in hot
dry weather. There is one thing
about this type of tobacco, however,
and that is that -it cures up nicely
even if very immature when cut; so
this crop seems to be curing up sur
prisingly well and growers are ex
pecting plenty of good colory leaf.
In the heavy producing section
around Lexington and Paris, the
yield per acre will probably not be
more than two thirds of an average

of Winchester several years ago, and
'for the past eight years had been in

There has beenNno shortage of la

and the cost has ,been moderate. It
is believed that many farmers have
not paid over $2.50 per day for
hands for handling tobacco, and
most of them have paid only $2.00 a

SUNNING A PUBLIC UTILITY
An Ohio newspaper .man recently
said "No one attempts to tell a gro
cer, a butcher, a jeweler, or g. drug
gist how to run his store, how much
hen!should be allowed to charge for
his wares and the hours he should
kep his store open, but most peo
ple feel competent to run a newspa
per or public utility company and
are very generous in their advice
and criticism."
Whether this was written in a
spirit of pique or scarcasm, we do
not know. However, this does not
represent the attitude or feeling of
the operator of a live newspaper or
public utility to-day. Both of'these
institutions are open for construc
tive criticism at all times. What,
to these operators have became mat
ters of every day routine is a real
necessity to the public, and a good
many times, the very things we ac
cept as definitely established routine
and beyond reproach, should as a
matter of fact be relegated to the
scrap heap. -
There isn't a wide-awake opera
tor of a newspaper or public utility
to-day who does not welcome sug
gestions for improvement in the
service rendered the public. The
idea that suggestions are consigned
to the waste-basket has faded away
along with that famous utterance
"the pub'lic be damned" made by a
prominent railroad operator of the
previous generation.
We all welcome suggestions, and
when you observe what you believe
to be room for improvement, do not
hesitate to write or call the execu
tive in charge of your public utility
auu leu mm aoout it. ur course,
not all suggestions can be put into
effect, there may be reasons why
they cannot that you are not famil
iar with. But, out of what have
been considered , as "kicks" have
come some of the greatest improve
ments of to-day.

Besides his parents,, he is survived
by two brothers, Sanford Allen Al

who had been with theirNaunt, Mrs.
Louis Rogers, near Paris,, for several
days.
The body was brought to Paris,
and taken to the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Louis Rogers, where the funer

with services conducted by Rev. W.

HENDERSON
' Dr. Dan R. Henderson, aged
sixty-one, a former resident of Parjs,
died suddenly Monday at his home
on South Hamilton street, in
Georgeto-yn. Dr. Henderson had
been in apparently good health, and
arose at the usual time, but after a
sliort time complained of not fpplineri
well. He was not thought to be
dangerously ill, and a physician was
ca'lled, but Dr. Henderson died be
fore he arrived.
Dr. Henderson will be remember
ed here as a pupil at the oldCity
School, where he was noted as an
all-round athlete. His school days
were spent here, when his father,
Rev. Dr. J. A.endeson, was pastor
of the Baptist "church. He was a
brother of the late Dr. Harry Hen
derson, for many years one of the
best-known ministers of the Metho
dist church. Dr. Henderson had
been in the drug business in George-!
town for the past thirty years, and
was well-known throughout Central
Kentucky.
Dr. Henderson is survived by his
widow, who was before her marriage
Miss Pattie Moore, of Georgetown,
and three children, M. Daniel Hen
derson. John Daniel Henderson, and
Miss Mary Harper Henderson.

While digging for water on the
farm of Jake Corman, about two
miles from Wilmore, the men who
were working there discovered a
large cave and explored it for a long
distance.
The entrance to it is quite small
and has heretofore been .unobserved,
but once inside it the cave is roomy
with a large "stream of water run
ning through, it. Curious rock for
mations hang from the roof and
stand up from the floor.
Robert, Luther, George and Jake
Corman entered the cave and went
about two miles through it. They
saw no end to it. As it was late in
the afternoon they returned to the
entrance, but expect to explore in
in the near future. It would ap
pear that tlys is by far the .largest
f.and most interesting cave that ha3
yet been discovered in this section.
Two of the curious formations in
fhecave were brought to the Wil
more Enterprise office and are there
for inspection by anyone who de
sires Vo look at these odd rocks.
