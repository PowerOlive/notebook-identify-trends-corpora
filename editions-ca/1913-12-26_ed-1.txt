Wilson, in this city,stating that he was planning a visitto Paris in January, Mr. James A.Stewart, formerly of Paris, died suddenly from heart failure on the streetin Wheeling.The news was received 'here in theform of a telegram to his life-longfriend and a former employer, Dr. J.A. Wilson, with whom he had beenassociated in the drug business herefor about thirty-eight years. The tele-igram gave only the meager announcement of his sudden death, statingthat he had been stricken with Tieartfailure while walking down a businessstreet at Wheeling, and expired in afew minutes.Mr. Stewart was aged about 70years, and apparently enjoyed thebest of health. About three weeksago he concluded a visit with hisfriend, Dr. J. A. Wilson, in Paris. OnTuesday morning Dr. Wilson receiveda souvenir post card from Mr. Stewart, dated December 22, 5:30 p. m.,which was, no doubt, written a shorttime before Mr. Stewart was stricken.On the card Mr. Stewart wrote thathe planned to visit Paris about themiddle of January.Mr. Stewart was one of the bestknown and most popular gentlementhat ever lived in Bourbon, and wasfamiliarly known as "Cap" from thefact that for many years he was Captain of the old Rescue Fire Department in Paris. Coming to Paris onJanuary 1, 1870, he succeeded Dr. J.A. Wilson as pharmacist for the firmof Paxton & Barnes, Main Streetdrugists, and continued with the firmuntil 1873, when the business wasbought by Dr. J. A. Wilson.Mr. Stewart remained in the employ of Dr. Wilson for a period of.thirty-eight years, and resigned hiBposition about three years ago in order that he might spend' the remainder of his days with his only relative,a niece, Mrs. Jennie Griffith Brown,in Wheeling.Deceased was born in West Virginia, and in early life became a member of tho Masonic Lodge. After locating in Paris he transferred hismembership here and became one ofthe best known and most popular Masons in the State. He took theKnights Templar degree at Cynthiana before this branch of the Masonswas instituted in Paris, and nevertransferred his membership from thatlodge."Mr, Stewart was a devoted and consistent member of St. Peter's Episcopal Ch'irch in Paris, and took anactive part in the affairs of thechurch. He was a most charitablyinclined man and gave freely of hismeans to those in less fortunate circumstancos. On Tuesday a box wasreceived in Paris from Mr. Stewartcontaining presents to be forwardedto the Masonic Home in Louisville.The funeral services was conductedat the home of Mrs. Brown in Wheeling at 10 o'clock Wednesday morning,and the remains were interred in theWheeling Cemetery with Masonichonors.Their Very LiberalPatronageAnd Wish Them o4U aHapoy and Prosperous. .

Hendricks,Sales AsrentLexington, Ky.The art of aviation, or flying inheavier-than-air machines, was tenyears old last Wednesday. It was onDecember 17, 1903, that Orvill andWilbur Wright, the famous Ohio aviaors, conquered the air in a series of! four short successful flights at SimmsStation. Since that time the aeroplane industry has been revolutionized. It has beentaken up by the people of all lands and some wonderfulflights and feats have been accomplished. During the past few yearsthe advancement has been along newand more successful lines than in theearlier years. The heavier-than-airflier has now become an importantfactor in warfare and war equipmentand to-day there is not a country thatdoes not include the aeroplane in itsmilitary and naval equipment, tThough the progress of he sciencehas been remarkable, each year hasseen an -increase in the number ofW J persons killed. The first deah wasU141 UL J-JltJUL. OClJ-IlUge VI UK? U. O.Signal Corps, who was killed in aflight at Fort Myer Sept. 17, 1908.Four aviators met death in 1909, thirty-twoin 1910, seventy-three in 1911,one hundred and thirteen in 1912, andone hundred and thirty-seven in thepresent year. The total number ofaviators who have perished amountsto 437. vOf the 137 fatalities this year 18occurred in the United States. Tothis number may be added the deathof a California aviator in British Columbia and of Lieut. Rich, of theUnited States Army in the Philippines. The list shows that the aviationfatalities this year have been diptributed over twenty different countries. A most noticeable feature isthe preponderance in all countries offatalities among the military fliers.This is due to the fact that more attention has been given to military aviation than ever before, while exhibition flying has been decreased because it is no longer a novelty andfails to attract the public attentionthat it did a few years ago.The casuality list of Germany andranee are the heaviest in numbers,!Germany naving had 39 fatalities during the year and France 37. In bothcountries the majority of the victimswere military aviators. .England,with a fatality list of ten, made bv farthe best showing of any of the nations which have extensivelv used aircraft.The Italian fatality list, in view ot Itne large number of licensed aviatorsin that country, is remarkably lowonly four Italian aviators having perished during the year. Russia hassuffered eight fatal accidents duringthe year, Argentine four, Japan andTurkey three each, while the othershave been scattered one each in Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Scotland,Canada, Portugal, Morocco, the Philipines, China, Cochin-China and theIsland of Trinidad.4,-- -yGaby Deslys.willing to marry her I loved her somuch and so, when I met this womanon the street and took her home andshe made some remarks about thewoman I loved, I became so angrythat I took out my knife and stabbedher.

Thisis a question to which French physlologiats are giving much attention at .the present time.M. L. Chassaigne believes that they Ican, and do. His opinion is based oninteresting experiments. Taking amimosa plant, 'he exposed it to theaction of heat. The leave3 writhed asif in pain. A simple mechanical effect, say the skeptics; a proof of sensibility, says M. Chassaigne, since itdoes not take place if the mimosa beanesthetized.If the vase containing the mimosa iis placed in a glass globe with a pieceof cotton impregnated with cloroformor any other volatile anesthetic forhalf an hour, the foliage becomeswilted and the plant has all the appearances of being in a deep sleep.If it be now subjected to the action ofheat it remains unaffected.2l. Chassaigne has repeated thesame experiments with many differentkinds of plants, but always with thesame result. "It Is maintained," h8says, "that plants do not suffer because they have no nerves."Many physiologists hold thatnerves are but the extension of protoplasm, modified and adapted to fulfillthe required function. Hence the protoplasm of plants can perfectly wellact as a rudimentary nervous system."ASK THE FARMERwho has one, what wonders the Cumberland Tel !ephone works for him. He will reply:1.

Apparently aware of its aristocratic n-jture, it is delicate beyond words and(exacting to the last degree upon the. care and attention of its minions. Hutin appearance no mortal plebian.worm could be uglier. When fullI grown it is from three to three and' a half inches long, with a small headcovered by a hard scale like a metaljieimer., ana Having a pair of lateralmoving jaws of formidable size. Inits slender body, extending almost theentire length on either side of thealimentary canal, are the two all-importantsilk glands, uniting near hemouth in the spinneret, with whichthe work is done which gives thecreature its lasting fame.The wonders of its brief career begin, a the instant if the caterpillan'sbirth, when by the first contact withair it is made to assume a volumemany times greater than when contained in the egg. Aimost immediately, too, it begins to eaf,v its foodbeing exclusively the leaves of themulberry tree. This eating neverceases day or night, save when therworm is asleep. By consequence, atthe end of thirty days, the creature is! more than 14.000 times larger thanit was at birth surely a most astounding record of growth. By thistoken, a human infant weighing tenpounds at birth within a monthwould turn the scales at seventy tonsweight. ,About five days after birth, when ithas increased considerably in size,the silk worm suddenly ceases togormandize, moves about restlesslyfor a time and fastens itself atlength by its false feet to some object, remaining motionless with itsbody erect. This is the begining ofJ its first sleep or molt. Soon changesbegin to take place in the creature'sanatomy. Within a few hours themetalic helmet falls to earth from itshead, and through this opening theworm wriggles itself out of its sheathemerging in a garment completelynew. So radical has been the firsttransformation that a day or two ofinactivity follows it, to allow the newly formed issues to harden. Then thevoracious appetite returns, and thesame endless eating both day andnight ensues till the next molt, somefour or five days later. This secondtransformation is like the first, and itis not unlike the the two succeedingones through which the creature passes. It imerges from each successivemolt larger in size and in capacity forfood, only that the period ensuing upon the final molt is marked by a degree of vorciousness hitherto unapproached, being a season of no sleep,but endless eating day and night, until the worm's maximum growth isreached. This period over," the appetite becomes listless, and soon itsbody is perceived to be much thinnerand semi-transparent. Very soon itbegins to run about, lifting its headand turning it in all directions as ifin quest of some o ""ct. It is thecrisis in the creature's career, thework of spinning its cocoon, and it isseeking a suitable place.Over the tray full of mulberryleaves in which the silk worm haslived all the while is now let downanother tray, having a bottom of wireI'netting with meshes of ample sizeEagerly the worm crawls up throughan opening in the netting and entersthe upper tray to find it a minatureforest. Small bundles of brush orstraw placed upright in the tray afoot or more apart, with spreadingbranches that join at the top, fromideal arbors and retreats for the purpose of the worm. Accordingly itloses no time, but at once throws outa silken thread from its spinneret.Then a net is formed to hold the cocoon; and presently the spinning be-(gins in dead earnest. Soon a veil isformed about the worm, which, moving its head at the rate of about seventy strokes every minute and describing ares 'or circles crossed in theform of the figure eight, graduallycloses itself in. About three days and'nights will be required to completethe process. In ten days the cocoonis matured and may be gathered. Immediately it is subjected to steamheat, in order to kill the chrysalis andprevent its breaking the silken threadby emerging from its prison.S1298We ako hare & full line of Schlos Bret guaranteed-tailored Suks for $15 to $25.

When one hasthe feed, he can perhaps arrange forsome vara place in which to housethe pigs.In a barn behind steers is a goodplace for them, but the percentage offarmers feeding steers is small, so thiswould scarcely answer the purpose forthe majority. Some, of course havewarm pig barns. Those who intend togrow fall pigs for some years mightinvest in some little low cots for them.These should be not more than threefeet high on one side and two feet onthe other.The slope roof which covers themshould be on hinges, so that it may belifted up and bedding put in. A gunnysack will constitute the door. In oneof these low houses, with plenty ofclean straw for bedding, the pigs willhuddle together and keep nice andwarm. Such houses may be constructed at slight cost; yet the manwho intends to grow pigs for only ayear or so would scarcely be warranted in putting money into them.Those who have fall pigs, especiallysmall sized ones, ought to study thesituation well before taking a stepone way or the other. There are asmany different circumstances as thereare individuals, and what is wisdomfor one would be folly for another.Any farmer who is willing to giveintelligent and thoughtful consideration to the matter, and who will con-i suit with others who have had experience in winter feeding, can settle theproblem for himself better than anyoutsider can possibly do; but, as amatter of fact, many who are sellingare doing so simply because they happen to be, and those who are retaining pigs are retaining them for nomore substantial reason. This is allwrong.ACCIDENTS MAY BE AVOIDEDj Opening Through Side of Stall Perj mits Stranger to Pass Feed andWater to the Animal.The accompanying illustration showshow accidents may be avoided withthe stallion when his regular keeperis absent or sick, or for any reasonunable to attend to him at feed time.says the Iowa Homestead. Most stallions do not care to have strangersaround them, and in case it becomesnecessary for the boje or some -ofthe women tolks to feed the stallion,IHandy for Feeding Stallions. jhe is very apt to cfowd out of his box jstall and get away, perhaps injuring IL"c.

Not only can the stallion'sgrain and roughage be fed throughthis opening withoutentering the stall,or even tossing feed in through theopen door, but water can be carriedand set in the manger for him, thutavoiding all danger whatsoever in caring for the animal. Care should betaken, however, In reaching the handtoo far Into the opening, as a playfulnip of the stallion's powerful teethis apt to snip off a finger or painfullylacerate an arm.Goed Bedding for Horses.A good way to keep a horse clean Jin the stable is to clean out all dirt, jetc., and then cover the floor about jthree or four inches thick with drysawdust, as far back in the stall as jthe horse usually stands, then cover jthe sawdust with straw, or beddingthat you may use. The sawdust will 'absorb the moisture, and therefore jmake the other bedding last longerIn case It is scarce. The sawdust 'should be replaced by fresh occasionally. Mixing Grain for the Cows.A good, tight, clean barn floor is agood place to mix the grain intendedfor the cows, emptying first the light,bulky feeds, such a corn and cobmeal or distillers' grains, spreadingthese out fire or six Inches thick,pouring on the next lightest, etc.Tkea. begia at one edge, shovel thefeed back into a pile a couple offeet to the right or left.

'vii. xvuper suggests that it would be in the interestof both the service and the employesto amend the law so as to authorizeSunday work and grant compensatorytime off to employes assigned to Sunday duty.The experimental delivery of mailin villages has been a failure, Mr.Roper reports, and he recommendsthat the service be discontinued June30 next. He recommends ithat thecompensation of rural carriers bechanged from milage to an eight-hourbasis.He also strongly urges that manysmaii independent postofflces be discontinued and re-established as stations of nearby large postoflices.General approval to the operationof the eight-hour law is given by Mr.Roper. The schedules of 60,000 employes have been adjusted to the law.It is suggested, however, that theeight hours of employment withintwelve consecutive hours might bebetter than within ten.The report estimates that 300,000,000 parcel post packages were handled during the first six months of thesystem's operation.

Morethan two billion board feet of Umbo with a value of four and a halfmillion dollars on the stump, was soldby the forest service last year, according to the annual report of HenryS. Graves, forester, published today.This, is an increase of 167 per cent,over the sales of the preceding year.The timber sold was largely for future cutting under contracts that willrun for a number of years. The actual rut was a little less than 500 million board feet, an increase of 15 percent, over 1912. Still larger sales arein prospect.Timber Sale Methods and Problems.The timber sale policy of the for-est service is summarized as aiming 'flrst of all to prevent losses by fireand secondly to utilize the ripe timber which can be marketed. Other I- ----- iaime are: To cut so as to insure rer.r n H H 'SiB H b H vnMNHIH WE H B a H H 'IHstocking and forest nermanece: toiLUU" blie anu "rnDer claims, to se-get the full market value for the timber sold; to prevent speculative ac-quisiHon ona private monopoly ofpublic timber and to maintain competitive conditions in he lumber industry so far as possible; to providefirst or the need of the local communities and industries; to open landsof agricultural value to settlementwithout allowing them to be tied upby timber speculators; and finally tosecure as soon as possible the costof production and administration tothe government and a revenue to thenational forest States, to which go25 per cent, of all receipts.A large number of national forestsalready more than pay operating- expenses. The revenue from the Alaskan forests now exceeds the cost ofadministration. The same is truegenerally in the Southwest.Range Management and Receipts'The forage resources of the National forests are pointed out as contributing to the maintenance of over20 million head of livestock, whichsupply in part at least the demandsfor meat, hides or wool of every Statein the Union. The receipts for grazing during: 1913. thouch second to! those from timber were more than aThe system of ranee managementemployed by the forest service is heldto offer hope of reliet to the averagecitizen concerned over the dwindlingsupply of meat products and theiralarming rise in cost.

Cattle from the Haydea National Forest in Colorado took thegrand championship prize at the National Live Stock Show in Denver,and in many cases the lambs fromthe forests topped the market. Losses from predatory animals are growing less as the wolves, bears andother animals are killed off by forestofficers.Game Protection,In connection with the grazingwork, the forests serve to protect thegame; and the Wichita forest, withits buffalo herd, is one of the showplaces of Oklahoma. During the yearthe service co-operation with the biological survey in placing over twohundred elk on various national forests. A large number of streams werestocked with trout fry.Claims on National Forests.A large part of the report is devoted to a discussion of various kindsot claims under which title to landwithin the forests is sought. Nearlya thousand homesteads were taken upunder a special act which provides foropening to settlemetn land suitablej for agriculture. The report states.however, that some old homesteadclaims were instituted for the purposeof securing timber, and the same isstill true of ome mining claims."Any attempted frauds under themining laws are usually resorted toby interests in no way associatedwith mining, similarly the vast majority of homestead frauds are notchargable to practical farming, butappeal to popular prjudice has beenmade in the name of the mining in-'dustry and in the name of the farmers of the country."Mining Claims."The mining laws," Mr. Gravessays, "afford the greatest cloak forland frauds in the national forests,fraudulent mining claims are in-itiated by men and interests having10 connection whatever with the, , t4 -- .mm5 maustry ine mining laws,10r example, nave been used to covercure farms and ranches, to securemineral springs, sites for saloons, wa-ter Power feJtes and stock wateringIt has often been asserted that thenational forests have operated as abar to legitimate mining development Figures collected in Coloradoduring the past year show that, ifanything, there is more activity inprospecting on national forests thanoutside."As with the live stock industry,the proper relations of the forest service with the mining indusry shouldbe co-operative."Classifying Lands For Use.One of the largest tasks of the service during the past year has beenthe classification of lands within thenational forests in respect to theirhighest future use. This work wasundertaken during 1913 on a morecomprehensive scale than ever before because there was specific annro-GALLEY TWOpriation tor the purpose. Large areasare being classified where the amountof land chiefly valuable for agriculture warrants its being taken out ofthe forest, and it also takes care ofareas on which detailed classification will disclose small areas suitablelor agricultural development withinthe forests. The work is being carried on with the assistance of thebureau of soil and the bureau ofplant industry. One result of thiswork was the elimination of 340,000acres from the Nebraska National forest, 23,000 acres from the Rainier, inWashington, and 413,770 acres fromthe Deschutes and Paulina, in Oregon.About 300,000 acres in small isolated tracts were listed for settlementduring the year. The areas now be-MrnXMa.. ., .y.j,,.. .,ng examined for clai-ctio. havetotal area of abqut three miUiwfacres. vWater Power Development.The development of -water powerjpon the " national forests increasedrapidly during the year, particularlyn California; It is the purpose of theservice to encourage power 'development in every - possible way, whilesafeguarding the interests of the public. The minimum output from thepermits now in force is nearly 800chousand horsepower.Regulations now in force aim tosafeguard the interests of the public,prevent speculative holding of powersies, provide for complete a.id properdevelopment and continuous operation, secure a return o the government for the privilege granted, provide a means by which Sates andmunicipalties may acquire power permits, and prevent unjust charges being placed on the coiisumer.Improvements On The Forest.The forests 'are being made increasingly accessible. More nan 350 milesof road, nearly 300 miles of Are lines,nearl 4,000 miles of telephone lines,'and 2,600 miles of trails were built.The present value of all public improvements on the forests is somewhat over $3,000,000, two-thirds ofthis amount having been put intolines of communication and protection. Receipts from all sources for theyear were slightly under $2500,000,showing an increase of 14 per cent,over 1912, while expenditures for administration and protection wereslighly over $4,600,000, showing a decrease from 1912 of 2 per cent. It ispointed out that the work of examing and appraising timber prior tosale is seriously behindhand in someregions and that larger receipts fromtimber are contingent upon the fundsthat can be made available for thispurpose. Although money for timbersale work is necessarily substractedfrom what is needed to protect theforests against fire, improve organization of the fire-protective systemhas increased its efficiency. Owingpartly to favorable weather conditions the total fire loss was only $67,-000, less than 19 per cent, of last year,which was the best to date.The resident population of the forests is given as nearly 200,000, andthe transient population as over 1,-500,000. Recreation use of the for-!ests is increasing greatly, and is insome places gving rise to the needfor careful sanitary regulation in theinterest of the 1,200 cities derivingtheir water supplies from streamsprotected by the forests.Money For The States.Under existing law, 25 per centofthe gross receipts from the forests ispaid over to the States by the Federalgovernment for the benefit of countyschools and roads. An additional 10per cent, is expended in buildingroads and trails for the benefit of thepublic. About $587,000 will be available for the States during the current year from last year's receipts,besides $235,000 provided for in theroad fund. Altogether, including special funds to Arizona and New Mexico, the national forests provided nearly $867,000 to be expended for theben-eiiu ut uic oLiices in w uhjil uitjy are rsituated.Appalachian Forests.Moie than 700,000 acres have beenacquired for national forest purposesin the Southern Appalachians andWhite mountains, of which consider-;ably more than half was secured during 1913. These lands are being pro-)tected against fire and he work of thegovernment has greatly strengthenedlocal sentiment against forest fires.Some 250 miles of trail, to help firecontrol, were completed during theyear.Co-operation With States.Co-operation with States in protecting forested water-sheds from firehas brought about a co-operativefield organization in fifteen States andthe same arrangemet is completedwith three others.We all like o be told what ggodfellows we are, how smart we are,and how much better than otherJ V H V .

He went to Cincinnati,and found that within aiblodc otheFederal Building the city had beeenflooded with the counterfeit notes.Mr. Donnella returned to Louisvilleand immediately sent out a warningto all Kentucky towns and cities.The new counterfeit is a $10 UnitedStates note of the recent Lewis andClarke issue, commemorative of theLewis and Clark Exposition at Portland, Oregon. It has a buffalo as acentral figure. The counterfeit is ofseries 1901, check letter "C," platenumber 634, and the bogus bills areal 1 of the same serial number, D,12449671. They purport to be signedby J. C. Napier, Register of theUnited States Treasury, and Lee McClung, Treasurer of the UnitedStates.The spurious notes are printed onordinary bond paper. The color ofthe seal and counter is a brick red,instead of carmine, as in the genuine.The silk fibers are counterfeited bypen and ink marks in red, blue andblack. Where the bills are dark,they are altogether too black andth:,s black has a glossy appearance.The counterfeit is one of the photetched variety, has a "raggy" feel,and a slightly scratchy appearance.It is usually soiled to conceal defects.
