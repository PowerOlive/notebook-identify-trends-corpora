described Â¬scribed as a dangerous man and andit it is noticed that this description comes c9mes from frommenmen who in 1896 claimed that the Hydes H Hy des the McCurdys McCurdysand and the Depews stood stoodforfor National Honor He was also thus described d scribed in 1896 and if you will re refer Â¬fer to several of o his speeches delivered in inth in that t memorable m morable campaign one can canreadilyreadily see see se that he is isa a dangerous d1ngero s Dan man not for the great reat common people but butforfor the trusts and an big thieves that th t are sapping the life life blood
