Trembling with terror his eyesno sooner got used to the gloom forit was not yet show-time and thelights were out when he perceivedthe king of bqasts glaring at him fromthe oppsite side of the cage. "Oh, oh,oh," cried he, "my poor wife! Shall Iever see Ould Oireland again? Oh,oh, don't eat me Mr. Lion, don't eatme!"Just at this moment he was astounded to hear from the interior ofthe lion a gruff voice which said:"That's all right, oocky, I'm an Irishman myself." ,BIG NAME FOR SMALL BOATBourbon LaundryDWIS & FUNK, Props.W Telephone No. 4.

Sometimes the food is taken to the burying ground to save the spirits thetrouble of moving. When a child ishorn among the islanders it takes thename of the last deceased member ofthe family, and on it devolves theduty of feeding its foster father'sspirit. The Eskimos have a horrorof being childless, because their spiritswill languish and their name be forgotten. As they say: "S'pose no mik-a-nina(children) ghost plenty hungry." Often an Eskimo will beggarhimself giving a great feast in honorof his illustrious ancestor; but hegains great renown thereby, andplaces all his visitors under life-longobligations to him.

This question probably!has occurred to nearly every one, andthe answer is given in The New YorkTelephone Review. The reason isthat the "calling party" may have anopportunity to correct the operatorif she makes an error. The operators,however, are trained 'to expect somekind of an answer. Their attentionbeing keyed up to receive a possiblecorrection in case they make a mistake, it would be of great assistance1 if they were given a polite "thankyou or some other amrmative answerin case they repeat the number correctly.$10.90The excellent tailoring perfection of fit and quality, of materials of these suits and the law price will make a grand purchasefor ysu.Call and sss tbem atios.

Itwas originally, as the name implies, across-country contest between huntingmen, who made some distant churchsteeple their winning post. The earliest recorded match of the kind wasrun in 1752, from Buttevalit church tothe spire of St-Leger church, in county Cork. But what is considered "thefirst regular steeplechase" followedthe festivity of an Irish hunt dinnerin 1803.

It is probably one of the mostexpensive films ever turned out andshows with Biblical accuracy the lifeof Jesus of Nazareth from His birthin a manger to his prucifixion upon across at Mount Calvary.A reverent motion picture story produced with painstaking care . in authentic locations in Palestine andEgypt. A film that is destined to bemore farreaching than -the Bible intelling the story of the perfect life andsupreme sacrifice of the Savior, in allcountries and to all peoples.Dr. Charles H. Parkhurst, after seeing the film, said: "I yielded myselfunreservedly to the inuence of theoccasion and came away from therepresentation with a feeling that thetransactions of Our Lord's life hasbeen passed to posterity by a faithfulrepresentation of scenes that cannothelp but have a powerful influence forgood on all who see them."The entise surroundings of the picture are in keeping with the dignityof the subject.In one scene a wonderful effect isproduced by the figure of the AllMysterious, solemnly passive Sphinx,keeping guard in the pale moonlightand Joseph lying asleep beneath.There are five reels to this greatpicture and you should see it by allmeans. The News can truthfully saythat you will never regret it.Columbia."The Pride of the South," a threereel Bison feature, will be the attraction at the Columbia Theater Saturday.COMMENCEMENT EXERCISESOf Western High School Held Wednesday Evening.u s - ."
