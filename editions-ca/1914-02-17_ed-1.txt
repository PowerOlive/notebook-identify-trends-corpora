H. Mulliken,State Game Warden George M. Hill,of this city, is exerting every effortto impress the farmers and sportsmenof this and adjoining counties withthe importance of protecting quailduring the cold weather, and especially during the period when theground is covered with snow, andwhen they have practically no foodupon which to subsist.Farmers upon whose places thereare known to be quail -are asked tosupply small grain, and scatter itabout in places where the birds areknown to frequent. This Will provea great help in prolonging the livesuntil a more favorable season whenthey will seek their own food."If this course is followed by thefarmers generally," said Mr. Hill,"there will be a bountiful crop of thebirds when the season forvhuntingopens. T he lack of interest uponthis point has been responsible forthe death of quail in large number andthe result is a short crop of birds.Reuben Henderson, a negro, wasshot and probably fatally woundedFriday shortly before midnight.Jas. J. Curtis, propiietor of a saloonnear the Louisville & Nashville depot,is charged with the shooting, and isunder bond awaiting developments inthe case of Hender&on, who is at theSt. Joseph Hospital, in Lexington.The shooting, it i& said, occurred inCurtis' saloon on Tenth street, andwas the result of a trivial difference.Henderson was employed as porter atthe place. There were several witnesses to the affair.Henderson, it is said, had gone tothe saloon with a message from Curtis' wife, which he delivered, and thisincurred the anger of the proprietor,who secured a weapon from a drawerin the counter, and fired at the man ashe was going out one of the doorsleading from the saloon.It was not thought the bullet hadstruck the negro, who continued torun, and it was not known that he hadbeen injured until some time after,when Henderson was found in theLouisville & Nashville yards a shortdistance from the sa:oon. He was ina semi-conscious condition, and wassuffering considerably from exposure.Upon examination it was found thatthe bullet had entered the back a fewinches above the hip and had passedentirely through his body.At two o'clock Saturday morninghe was taken to St. Joseph's Hospitalin an automobile, where an operationwas performed in tne hope of savinghis life. His condition is very critical and little hope is entertained for hisrecovery.A warrant was ssued Saturday forthe arrest of Curtis, and he waCs takeninto custody by Patrolman King. Hewas later released on bond.County Attorney George Battertonwent to Lexington yesterday afternoon for the purpose of taking an ante-mortem statement from the negro.A message received from Lexingtonlast night stated that Henderson's condition was very grave and he was notexpected to survive the night.N4If You Need a HatAnd want to buy one cheap,take a look ill our show window at the $3, $4 and $5 ,hats which we are selling justfor a day or so for a0$1.00Bill Come and buy one whilethey last.x"sps-8IMitchell & Blakemore,The Store for Mien's StylesParis, Kentucky'iLwumiiiimiiiaiuiiiiuiniiiiiiimiiiiNnENGINE SPLIT SWITCHAND JUMPED TRACK.Engine No. 155 drawing northboundtrain No. 34 split a switch at the Winchester street crossing yesterdaymorning and jumped the track.

To the playgoer who has heapedapplause upon attractions that havedepended upon paper,mache noses,artificial and crude devices for theirhumor, "The Firefly" proves thatbeautiful and lasting music and thatcleian and clever humor belong hand-in-handin the arrangement of an operatic attraction, that one cares tohave linger long in one's memory."The Firefly" carries the playgoerinto scenes gay witi color and merriment. It effercesces with melody inits solo numbers and in chorus ensembles its music s raptuous. Ecstatic dances and esthetic scenes effects from an appealing backgroundto lend color to a delightfully romantic story.Miss Thayer will be seen in thepleasing and effective roles first as alittle Italian street singer, then, toward the latter part of the first act,disguisiing herself as a boy, to escapefrom her cruel father.There is not a moment, when MissThayer is on the stage, that herchildlike patter dofcfl not amuse theaudience. She is graceful, coquettish, a rowdy little tomboy in turn,and she displays st much energy inacting her part that one cannot helpbut be impressed that she is more animated and fascinating than many another prima donna of greater renown.The author Otto rfauerback, hasprovided the appealing, humorous andsometimes pathetic story, aboutwhich Rudolf Friml has entwined theentrancing musical setting of "TheFirefly," which come to the Ben AliTheatre, Lexington, February, 24thand 25th, with Wednesday matinee."THE SUNSHINE GIRL."Charles Frohman will present JuliaSanderson in the triumphant musical.comeay success "The Sunshine Girl"at the Lexington Opera House for anengagement of one night, Thursday,,Feb. 19.

Withthis winsome little woman in the titlerole, tile piece ran all last season inNew 'York to capacity business andwas easily the one big musical hit ofthe Metropolitan season. The scoreis by Paul Rubens and is said to beby far the most tuneful ever importedfrom London. Charles Frohman issending the original New York castand chorus of over 100 people to Lexington.

We hadn't heardof the .death.Every woman should let her husbandhave his own way once in11 a whilesjust for a change. . . 'V VNews from Washington indicatesthat the neglect of the South in landreclamation work continues while thefar West is getting more and moregovernment aid and consideration.The national government has expended approximately $75,000,000 onthe reclamation of a little over 3,000,000 acres of land in the far West.It has spent nothing for the reclamation of the 75,000,000 acres of swampand overflowed lands of the country,the most of which are in the Southernand Central States.Secretary Lane, of the Interior Department, which has the irrigationwork in charge, favors an appropriaton of $100,000,000 for additional workbut has said nothing in favor of public appropriations to aid in work offlood protection and the reclamationof the swamp and overflowed lands ofsections in the South.With a Southern man in the President's chair, a Southern man asSpeaker of the House, and bothHouses Southern in politics and thecontrol in the hands of Southern men,it seems a crime that nothing is being done for land reclamation in theSouth and Central vest.The situation is all the more pathetic when it is recalled that the reclamation of the swamp and oveflowlands and their protection from floodsmeans much more to the whole UnitedStates than the reclaiming of a fewmillion acres from the desert. Itmeans many hundred million dollarsin annual crops, the saving of morethan a hundred million dollars a yearin flood losses, the prevention of manydeaths in floods and of many moreneedless deaths and inestimable suffering due to malaria and other diseases caused by the existence ofswamps.There is pending in Congress ameasure that would do for the Southand Central West Ml that the Reclamation or Irrigation Act has donefor the arid West. It is the bill (H.R. 8189; Senate 7134) presented inthe House by Speaker Clark and inthe Senate by Senator John SharpWilliams, of Mississippi. This isknown as the ClarK-Wdlliams floodprotection and drainage bill and issupported by the National DrainageCongress, whose nex: annual meetingis to be held at Savannah, Ga,, April22-25, 1914.The Clark-William bill is not in conflict with either the Newlands RiverRegulation of the Ransdell-Hum-phreysLevee bills, it makes immediately availabe about $30,000,000 forflood protection and drainage work,placing the expenditure of this sumin the Department af the Interior. Itis, in reality, an extension of theArid Land Irrigation Act to includedflood protection and drainage in theSouth and Central West and to putall of the country on an equal footing.The Clark-Williams bill providesthat the Secretary of the Interior shallmake surveys and plans for flood protection and drainage projects; that hemay. undertake the construction ofthework with the consent of the landowners and Stages, the cost ,to be repaid by a tax uDon the lands, assessed and collected by the State authorities; or he may turn the plans over tothe owners or States for them to carry into effect. It provides that theSecretary of the Interior may purchase the drainage bonds issued bythe State or drainage district, at par,to supply the needed funds. It provides for co-operation between two ormore States in the construction ofinterstate drainage of flood protectionprojects. It provides for co-operationbetween the Departments of War andthe Interior when the question ofnavigation is involved.In fact, the Clark-Williams bill willprovide for the systematic, comprehensive and speedy reclamation ofswamp and overflowed lands and theirprotection from disastrous floods.But this will not be done until ourSouthern Senators are Representatives awake to a realization of ourinterests and give their support toSpeaker Clark and Senator Williamsin procuring this or some similar bill.The United States ReclamationService has established every precedent needed. Although the generalopinion is that the arid lands reclaimed by this service have beengovernment owned lands this is notentirely true. Of the more than 3,000,000 acres so irrigated only aboutone third are government lands, theremainder being th; property of individuals, corproations, Indians,States and even railroads. In fact insome projects where millions havebeen spent every acre is private land,the government advancing the moneyfor the work and then doing it.Bonds to the extent of $20,000,000and bearing three per cent, interesthave been issued by the United Statesto provide additionar funds for continuing these irrigation projects, andstill more appropriations for the samepurpose are being asked for.Besides this the Interior Department has contracted with the Pacificcoast States, Oregon, Washington andCalifornia, to undertake additional irrigation projects, the States and thegovernment each to bear one half theexpense. Secretary Lane has agreedto set aside $4,000,000 from the reclamation fund to co-oprate with theState of Oregon in the construction ofmation fund to co-operate with "theState to appropriate a similar amount.The only reason wny the South isnot receiving similar aid in the reclamation of its lowlands is becausethe Southern representatives in Congress have not demanded the necessary legislation.TPfttf "Tf-KTJthspcneyfeet collect t2i IrrrfelHteJL MMC M: JLV germs of disease spreads tbeat crrermmmmmm i i T onsr la-od sag poisons qg wlUt typfcrtCT lie MOSQIIlf 0"K3i Wa i jects iafei i mi iii imiiMii ilium n rnr veins Mt-aTTA1A7E ARE all exposed to such dangers our or.Iy armor is good rWblood!

Mrs. Huntwas about thirty-five years of age andhad been married five times.Her first husband was the late General Cassius Marcellus Clay, the pioneer abolition leader, who in his oldage retired to his estate, "WhiteHall," in Madison county, and wasnoted for his many eccentricities.One of the things that completedthe estrangement between GeneralClay and his near relatives was hismarriage to Dora Brock, when shewas a mere slip of a girl. She livedat White Hall with him for a fewmonths, and then separated from himto marry a farm hand who lived in'the same neighborhood.$$iS iTUESDAY,February 24para'de; ofREX10 a. m., andComus Parade, At Nightt' POING THEI.R DUTY. ,Scores of Paris Readers are Learningthe Duty of the Kidneys.vTo filter the blood is the kidneys'luty.When they faiL to do this the kidneys are weak.

'Many new shirt waists are beingshown in the shops. The favoriteone seems to be of -white chiffoncloth, a transparent fabric considerably heavier than chiffon, but with itssoft and clinging qualities. The waistis made large and blousy, and the fullness at the neck is gathered upon alarge -silk cord, which ties loosely inthe front. The sleeves are long andhave turn-back cuffs. The tiny buttons are of black jet.Two thicknesses of net make another charming waist, which is fastened with pearl buttons as large asa twenty-five cent piece. The turnover cuffs are fastened with two ofthese buttons, used as links, joined together with a tiny silk cord.White serge skirts are worn withhomespun jackets of brilliant andvaried hues. Little soft hats of thesame material in approyed styles adddistinction to this costume, so suitable to the health and vitality of ouryoung women.A noticeable feature of the springstyles is the tendency toward the circlar rippling effect or godet flounces.Circular tunics are short in front, cutthat they may ripple down the fulllength. The lining is almost as muchin evidence as any outside portion ofthe dress.Short coats have these godetflounces, graduated from front toback, so full that the wastline is entirely lost in the undulations of theruffle.While the craze for narrow skirtswas at its height, Redfern launchedpleats. People looked, and, exceptfor a few devoted clients turned theirbacks. He persisted, and this yearpleats are to be seen everywhere andin almost "every conceivable form.Do not be deluded into thinking thatthis means greater width at the hemof the skirt, for it does not. If theyare put in the lower part of the skirtthey are laid flat, and caught with arubber, or tape to keep them from being misplaced.alllfEmbroidered Net and Charmeuse Comprise This Charming Costume.For the personification of virginsimplicity one had but to look at thegirlish bride. She wore no long,white satin skirt, so fashionable adecade ago. Gone was the statelyand heavy train! The gown was oftulle, caught at the waist in frontwith a group of six organ pleats. AnAlgerian jacket of embroidered chiffon, with long sleeves and gracefuldrapery, was fastened below the bustwith a garland of orange blossoms.The trainless skirt accentuated theyouthfulness of the oride. A veil ofembroidered tulle was caught behindin a jeweled bandeaux on the head,thus leaving the face .exposed. Ashower bouquet of liles-of-the-valleycompleted the costume.The little dress which is pictured inthe second illustration was shown ina window of a prominent Fifth Avenue shop as a suggestion for a bride'smaid's dress or a debutante's frock.The simple bodice of allover lace isunadorned, except lor the dainty chiffon apple blossoms which outline theedge of the neck and front-closing.Two wide ruffles, placed diagonallyfrom above one hip to below theother, accentuates the bouffant silhouette of the apple-green crepe deChine skirt. A wide sash of appleblossom silk knots at one side, andthe end falls gracefully to the knees.On the head is worn a Castle nat orlace to match the lace of the bodice,and trimmed with the apple-blossompink-and-green ribbon.The very latest and smartest moaeof making a dressy skirt 'is to haveone made with a pannier. There areseveral lengths given to these, someloncer, some shorter. Taffeta, chiffoncloth and embroiderea scrim are anappropriate ' materials for dressesTvith this type of skirt. The panniersare draped with considerable fullnessthe hips, in order that the puffedeffect may be obtained.
