CANCER
The greatest care should be given to
ativ littl sore mmole or scratch which
-
shows no disposition to heal under ordin
ary treatment No one can tell how soon these
will develop into Cancer of the worst type
So many people die from Cancer simply be
cause they do not know just what the disease is
they naturally turn themselves over to the doctors
and are forced to submit to a cruel and dangerous
operation the only treatment which the doctors know for Cancer The disease
promptly returns however and is even more violent and destructive than
oefore Cancer is a deadly poison in the blood and an operation plaster or
other external treatment can have no effect whatever upon it The cure must
come from witliin the last vestige of poison must be eradicated
Mr Wm Walpole of Walshtown S D says A
little blotch about the 6ize of a pea came under my left
eye gradually growing larger from which shooting pains
at intervals ran in all directions I became greany aiarmu
and consulted a good doctor who pronounced it Cancer
and advised that it be cut out but this 1 could not con
sent to I read in my local paper of a cure effected by
o ana aeciuea to try it w nc
Cancer becoming at first irritated and then discnarging

what threatened to destroy my life once held full sway
Positively the only cure for Cancer is Swifts Specific
S S S FOR THE BLOOD
because it is the only remedy which can go deep enough to reach the root of
the disease and force it out of the svstem permanently A surgical operation
does not reach the blood the real seat of the disease because the blood can
not be cut away Insist upon S 8 S nothing can take its place
