As Chairman of theCommittee on Ways and Means, and asa leader in the great fight for tariffreform, he has been recieved by hisfellow Democrats in a manner befitting his station and ability. Mr..Underwood has not come to this Stateto interfere in our home affairs, or totell us how to conduct our government, or what policies are the wisestto pursue. He very properly leavethese vexed questions to the candidates.fcWhc, if elected, will be Table tocarry out the reforms promised bytheir platforms.No man in this country is bettercapacitated to bring home to thepeople the facts that lie at the base ofthe great contset which was waged atthe last Congress, and which will continue to be waged for the enfranchisement of the people from the slavery ofa protective tariff. He is not only agreat party leader but he is more thanthat, a great patriot, who has boldlystood for what he believes is rignt.It is proper that Mr. Underwoodshould come to Kentucky at this timeto oorsult with his fellow-Uemocratsand to urge upon them the importanceof this year's contest, and its influenceupon the Presidential Campaign ofnext year, when the Democracy willhave its first real opportunity in manyyears to win a national victory. Bornin Kentucky and educated here he hasbeen made to understand that he is oneof us; that his visits is a sort of homecoming that recalls old memories andeld friendships; that his advice in thiscrisis is needed; and that his masterfuldiscussion of national policies has notonly added to the people's store otknowledge, but has given them a better appreciation of the difficulties outof which such leaders as himself andChamp Clark have led us.Mr. Under wood'-s speeches havedone a world of gcod. He has earnedthe gratitude of every Democrat inKentucky. No man has a brightertuture than he, and it may soon cometo pass that his promotion will measure up to his desserts, which are of thehighest.To Manufacture Natural Leaf.Charles E. Dexter and F. M. Spiler,of Owensboro, have arranged for headquarters in Louisville ast wpek for theKentucky Farmers Tobacco Company,of Hickman.

Therehas been subscribed by residents ofHickman and West Tennessee a totalot $108,000, and much stock has beentaken lccally by persons familiar withthe products of the company. Thecompany was incorporated in July anddespite the fact that its factory atHickman has not been completed it hasorders on hand which will keep it busyfar into the winter.The plants of the company will belocated in the various tobacco-growingsections, from which the company willsecure its material. The company willprcduce eight different grades of Burley and dark tobacco at the beginningand later will add other grades of burley for both smoking and chewing.The tobacco will be presented to thepublic in the same state as when itwas taken from the field.

It is easy to take up every position he has assumed and show by therecord that his private views and actsare at variance with his public protestations. The very latest evidence against himon this score is in the matter of freepasses, and has been produced by theLexington Herald. In a spetch accepting the Republican nomination, he referred to the Constitutional provisionagainst the use of free passes by public officials, and he pledged himself, ifelected Governor, to see that a lawwas placed upon the Statute book enforcing that section. Since his nomination, he has frequently condemnedthe railroads for issuing such passes,and public men for accepting them,and has pointed to it as fruitful sourceof corruption.On the very day that Judge O'Reararose in the State Convention and condemned the use of free passes, hisfamily rode from Frankfort to Louisville on passes issued by a railroad,and it is fair to presume that theycould not, and would net have iccepted these favors from the railroad without the knowledge and consent of JudgeO'Rear.It is just as culpable for the familyof the Judge of the Court of Appealsto ride on free passes as it would befor that official himself to receive suchfavors, and it violates the spirit if notthe letter of the Constitution when hepermits ihem to put him in that embarrassing position.This charge was openly made by' theLexington Herald,and it has been substantiated by ethers. So far JudgeO'Rear has not made any explanationof how it happened that he could be sotritterly opposed to the railroads givingfree passes to public officials when hisown family profits by the practice.In his speech at Bowling Green onMonday, Judge O'Rear condemned therairloads, because, as he charged, theyhave for many years secured cun'rol of..w .wt, wuuiiuiiicc. j.l una istrue.it is most reprehensible, and c&llsfur the severest condemnation ; but solong as Judge O'Rear's family continues to be the guest of the railroadsin their journeyings Jabout the State,this criticism will be received withsuspicion and with doutas to his consistency and sincerity. rPrevented Sale of Wife.John Tower endeavored to sell hiswife, Elizabeth, at auction in Londonin June, 1817, but the authorities prevented the sale.FirstClass Barber Shop. ,Mr. H.

HESTERBeing ambitious after reading sundry detective stories to enter the profession, I went to an office and askedfor employment. It happened that aman was wanted to go among a gangof footpads and burglars disguised asone of their kind with a view to learning certain facts concerning them. Itwas so dangerous a job that no regular detective would undertake it.These men know their own sort andwould easily recognize a spy. I, beingfilled with the romance of detectivework without having had any experience, tumbled to an offer of the jobat once.About 11 o'clock at night, disguisedas a tough, I reeled into a saloonwhere my men were supposed to be.I found them there and invited themto drink. 1 treated several times andthought I was getting in with themwhen suddenly there was a hammering at the door, and the barkeepercried: "Police! Git!" The lights wentout, and we were all left in the dark,scattering like so many rats. Thedoors were broken down, and the police rushed in. When the lights wereturned on it was found that the barkeeper and I were the only captives.How the rest got away I don't know.I was taken to a station, rfnd on theway I made myself known to the copwho walked beside me He gave abroad grin and said that was the mostbeautiful device of all that were practiced in the criminal profession. Itold him he would learn more aboutthat in time. 1 slept m a filthy cellfor the rest of the night and the nextday sent word to the detective agencythat I would like to have them comeand get me out. They sent one of theemployees, who had never seen me.Of course the police officers were notgoing to discharge me on any suchevidence, or, rather, want of it, and Itold the man to go back and tell theone who had hired me to come andvouch for me.He didn't come till late in the afternoon, and when he did he didn't recognize me. I told him 1 was the manhe had sent to the saloon for information, but he looked at me contemptuously and said that the man he had senthad likely met with foul play and 1was trying to get out of a bad scrapeby personating him. He hadn't seenme made up, and my disguise was soperfect that he believed me to be averitable villain. He went away without being convinced as to my identity,and 1 was obliged to spend anothernight in a cell.A week passed, and I was still a prisoner. Then one day I was indicted asone of the men in the saloon when thepolice made the raid, who had madeaway with the detective that the agency had sent out. In other words, 1was charged with being my own murderer. Dpon inquiry 1 learned that theman who had thus been sent out on amission bad disappeared, and it wassupposed he had been dispatched bythe gang.Here was a pretty how-de-do. I called again for the man who had sentme out but be refused to come to seeme, and 1 couldn't go to see him. Idoubted if it would do any good ifhe came. He had never seen me butonce, and then but for a momentHow could he be expected to recognizeme in my rough garb, especially as inthe saloon scuffle I had been very badly mauled?I sent for a lawyer and told him mystory. He appeared to believe me,but said there would be no use in putting such a story before a jury. Itwas so palpably false that it wouldprejudice my case. He said he wouldtr,v to get up a defense that wouldseem more probable. I asked him ifthere was anything more probablethan that a man could not have murdered himself and be alive. He replied that I would have to prove myidentity, which was impossible. Hewould try to think of some method ofdefense tnatwould be easier to provethan the truth. "We lawyers don'tcare anything," he said, "for thetruth. What we want is somethingwe can prove. An alibi affords thebest chance."When I came to be tried for beingimplicated in my own murder therewas no proof against me except thatI was known to have gone to the saloon from which I had disappearedand was one of the gang of rascalswhich was raided. This was considered prima facie evidence that I, probably with others, had killed myself. Itwas evident that I would get a longtenii on general principles.My lawyer's method was very ingenious. Having entered my claim tobe another person than myself, JohnBorland, he brought John Borland'smother into court to swear that herson on the night of the supposed murder was at home and in bed. Anotherwitness, who lived In the same house,swore to the same thing Then mylawyer called upon the policeman wbohad arrested me to swear that 1 hadbeen found in and taken from the saloon. The lawyer so badgered the policeman that he was not sure of me.Thus an alibi was established.I was acquitted. But I didn't continue the detectiv.e business. 1 hadhad all of that romantic occupation 1wanted.

Eva Gaskins, 304 Madison St.,Topeka, Kan., and Mr. P. H. Gavellas, Wagoner, Okla., as well as manyothers, telling about the wonderful results they have secured in the cure oftheir stomach and liver troubles bythe use of Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin. This remedy, as all readers doubtless know, has been before the publicfor a generation and is now beingmore extensively used than any otherremedy for stomach, liver and bowelcomplaints. According to reliable testimony, it seems to be a very quickand lasting cure for constipation, indigestion and dyspepsia, liver trouble,biliousness, headaches, sour stomach, gas on the stomach, drowsinessafter eating and similar disorders. Itis a liquid with tonic effect, and somild and gentle in action that a childas well as a grown person can take it,in fact, it has no equal for children,women and old people.It arouses the flow of gastric juice,and by a peculiar action trains thestomach and bowel muscles to againdo their work naturally, and in timemedicines of all kinds can be dispensed with. A free sample bottlecan be had for trial by-sending youraddress to the doctor, for in thisway Mrs. Gaskinds, Mr. Gavellas andmany others first learned of the cure.Later, when satisfied it is the remedyyou need, do as others are doing andbuy it of your druggist at fifty centsand one dollar a bottle.For the free sample address Dr. W.B.

The one buildsand enriches the world by his industrythey say and the other, contributingnothing'in helpful effort to the civilization of which he is a part, 'lives bythe brawn and brain of his brother.One wins the big prizes of life and theoiher, inert, inapt, musclon-bound andindifferent, though alike in origin anddestiny to the other boy, is a stragglerin the procession, just so much flotsomon the sea of progress. If it were truebut it isn't-this would be a severeindictment of that vast army of hardworking, honest, sincere, whole souledand whule hearted men, who for acomparatively small pittance, worknight and day to keep us on thestraight pasB and out of Jail, and towhom we have recourse as a faithfulfriend, when we want the place thatlittle gold circlet on the finger of thegirl we love, or need some one tochristen the baby, bring cheer andcomfort to the sick and send the deadproperly accredited to Peter at thepearly gate.When the fellow with a grievanceagainst the minister's boy hies alongwith his bile, remind him that SamuelFinley Breese Morse, the inventor ofthe telegraph, which broke down thefeudal walls of the old world and madethe universe akin by bringing the mostisoalted and remote corner - of thehabitable globe into instant touchwith the centers of civilization, was aminister's son and the grandson ofJonathan Edwards, one of the greatestpreachers that ever lived. Tell himthat Grover Cleveland and ChesterAlan Arthur, two of the twenty-sevenpresidents of the United States, wereminister's sons and regarded as anasset and a help rather than a handicap. And that General Nathaniel Greene,the trusted friend and ally of Washington at the battles of Trenton, Princeton, Germantown and Brandywine,was the God fearing son of a patrioticQuaker dominee and was none the lessuseful as a citizen because he wasvalorous as jl soldier. Also JosephAddison, the njnglish author and masterword 'painter ; William Cowper, thepoet:' Charlotte Bronte and JohnFletcher, disciples of Parnassus, whosemuse and writings set the world athinking were the children of clergymen. So were the late E. H. Harriman, the genius who standardized theAmerican railroads and Bob Ingersill,who "oured by the hardships enduredby his mother, through the ficklenessof country congregations in shiftinghis father iom pillar to post in searchof a mearge living, became with Voltaire and Paine, one of the world'sgreatest free thinkers and the principal apostle of the new "show me"philosophy. K. M. Turner, the brilliant contemporary of Thomas A. Edison and Alexander Graham, in electrical research, inventor of the acoustir.on, the ditograph, the interior telephone and other useful devices thatmake for present day efficiency, laysit to his father, Parson "Jim" Turner,a quiet, thoughtful Baptist preacherof Indiana, that he is what he is. Another conspicuous son of a Baptistclergyman who credits' the helpful influence of his father with being apotential factor in hs climb to fame isj Charles Evan Hughes, former Governor oi JNew York and now AssociateJustice of the United States SupremeCour,t.So when the -fellow with the grouchon the ministers' hoy comes around,and begins to hammer, just rememberthese things. Pass 'em out to him andit'll wake nim up. If he's made of theright stuff he'll feel like a boob fortalking the way he does and maybehe'll wish that he too was a minister'sboy.Preserve for Salt Water Fish.Bermuda wili soon have a salt water fishing preserve covering an areaof about five square miles.
