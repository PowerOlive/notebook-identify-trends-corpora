HITE
Miss Mattie Hite,- aged eighty-
one, a former resident of this city,
died at two o'clock Tuesday morn
ing at the home of her niece, Mrs.
Frank W. Shackleford, in Cincinnati,
after a short illness due to paralysis
and heart trouble. A few days pre
ceding her death Miss Hite was
stricken with paralysis, and a second
stroke being sustained shortly after,
complicated with heart trouble,
caused her death.
Miss Hite was a daughter of the
late Mr. and Mrs. William Hite, Sr.,
pipneer citizens Of Paris, her father
having been deputy sheriff of Bour
bon county for two terms. At the
death of her younger sister, Mrs.
O. H. Dudley, many years ago, Miss
Hite became a member of their
household and was in all that could
go to make a home, a true and
worthy successor to her sister. She
was a sister of John W. Hite, for
many years local editor of the old
Paris True Kentuckian, then edited
by the late Col. John G. Craddock,
William O. Hite, .for almost a life
time connected with the Paris fire
department, Mrs. W. -A. Hill, Sr.,
Land Mrs. Sarah Dudley, of- Paris,
all of whom preceded her to the
grave years ago. Her only surviv
ing sister, Mrs. Charles Rieckel, re
sides in Cynthiana. Between the"
sisters and brothers there was a liv
ing bond of love and mutual help
fulness that was remarkable. About
seventeen years ago, Miss Hite went
with the family of her niece, Mrs.
Frank Shackleford, to Cincinnati,
where they have since resided.
In her death there has gone to the
other world one of those beautiful
spirits which help to make the
world a better place to live in. She
was as tender and devoted as a
mother, a loyal friend, who thought
no evil of those with whom she came
in contact, and sincerely and de
voutly a Christian. Her sympa
thetic understanding of others won
the hearts of old and young alike,
and made her passing a very keen
sorrow to those near and dear to her.
The body was brought to Paris,
Wednesday morning, and taken to
the home of her nephew, Wm. W.
Dudley, on South Main street. The
funeral was held at the' Christian
church, at two o'clock Wednesday
afternoon, with services conducted
by the pastor, Rev. W. B. Ellis, who
paid a beautiful tribute to the high
Christian character and lovely life
of Miss Hite. The burial followed in
the Paris Cemetery. The pall-bear
