National Bank to Reorganize.
The Second National Bank -of -Cincinnati,
will be re-organized. This is
the second oldest institution of the
kind in Cincinnati and is third in
deposits. Bad loans it is cliamed is the
cause of the trouble It is said, that
the depositors will receive 80 per cent
at once. Financiers declare the in
stitution is solvent It will either be
re-organized by the Cincinnati Clear
ing House or a receiver appointed by
the Comptroller of the Treasury.
The little "Duplex" Electric Vacuum
Cleaner, which is built in Newark, Ohio,
by the Ramey Mfg. Co., is surely caus
ing considerable comment from the
housekeepers in Lexington, as over 100
have been sold during the past three or
four weeks. It is said this little suction"-!
machine will do the same identical work
as the large built electric machines,
which cost $125.00 and more. Yet the
' 'Duplex' ' retails for less than one-third
that amount. It saves the housekeeper
over one-lialf her-lalor in keeping her
house nsat and clean. No dust is scat
tered in the home and as the machine is
run oy eiectncitv, mere is scarcelv no
labor connected .with running, it. .
