HOME STUFF!
"Going out again to-night, I
guess."
"I won't be long."
"You won't be long; I suppose if
you ever left the house and said you
would be long I'd never see you
agin."
"You know where I'm going,
don't you? It would be different if
I was trotting around vtown going
to places you know nothing about."
"Honestly to hear you say it you
would have me believe that when
you leave the house you clasp your
hands, look heavenward, and if af
girl as much as looked at you, you
would say, 'Go way from me woman,
I'm married.' Yes you would not."
"Why is it that every time I start
to go out you start that blamed
hinting about who I go around with?
To hear you talk you might think I
was a Mormon. By 3rour way of
talking you would think there were
no respectable men in the world."
"You're a fine one to talk about
respectable men, when I think of
that crowd you travel around with.
Why three of them are single men;
respectable, my eye."
"I don't know what to say or how
to prove that every man in this
world isn't bad."
"If you take my advice you won't
try to prove something that can't be
done. I'll admit this, though, some
are worse than others, but I'm sure
you don't go around with many
good ones. I'm not blind you know.
No man in his right mind would
rescue.
But there will be some 50-odd
thousand who came out of the fight
niore or less disfigured who may wear
no ribbons.
. They are the scar bearers, the
wounded.
Not one of them but faced death
iii all the many guises that German
ingenuity of the most devilish kind
-'could contrive. But theirs was only
the ordianary chance of war.
Theirs the misfortune of being struck
down before they had their chance.
Some will not be permanently dis
abled. But thousands will be. And
everyone that is, everyone that took
Iiis chance over there must have his
cahnce- once more over here.
Uncle Sam has worked out an elab
orate plan of rehabilitation for these
wounded heroes. If they need med
ical attention after their return they
will get it- If they need special
training to fit them for such work as
their condition will permit them to
do they will get that training.
Whatever assistance is necessary
they will haver..
And Uncle Sam will bear the ex
pense, gladly, -gratefully; for his ob
ligation is one that can never be ad
equately met.
Much of it will be devoted to mak
ing payment of the services of those
who did their best to pay the price
., of world freedom.
For them too much can not be
ae; '!'. 1im
as any home in town to go out and
play cards as much as you do. It's
not cards that keeps you out."
"What do you think does?"
"Wouldn't I be a big fool to tell
! you all I know I should say not.
All I can say is you had better be
careful for you're going to come
some night and JL won't be here."
"Give me a kiss before I go?"
"You better keep your kisses for
those who'll appreciate them,"
"You make me sick the way you
talk."
"Go ahead out, but don't forget
what I told you; if I'm not here
some night don't be surprised."
John goes out and slams the door
just like a regular husband usually
slams a door, but to save his neck he
don't know whether he's playing
pinochle or going over the top and he
gets away from the game about 10
o'clock with a sick headache, as he
says, which his other seven-eights
has calmly gone to bed and forgot
all about it.

memorial to the unfortunates who
were drowned when the Tuscania
was torpedoed by a German sub
marine. Mrs. Rogers was a guest
very recently of Mrs. Clay. The
poqm was published in the Lexing
ton Herald, of Tuesday:
THE NEW DAY.
Our soldiers sleep on Scotland's
breast
And nearby waters guard their rest
While in their ever ceaseless flow
They chant a requiem sweet and
low.
We face the future void of fears,
Yet count the dead mid bitter tears
For equal rights' on land and sea
They gave their lives to make men
, free.
When victory shall safeguard each
home
Where little children love to roam
And maidens dwell on holy ground
Then will the earth with gladness
sound.
Fight on, brave men, the monster
tear;
Leave not a fragment of his lair
For we who watch and work and
pray
Await the dawn of Freedom's Day.
JANE HARRIS ROGERS.
