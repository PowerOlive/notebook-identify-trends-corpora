How to Detect the
Alum Baking Powder
"Which are the alum baking powders;
how can I avoid them unless they are named?
asks a housekeeper.
Here is one way: take the can of a low
priced powder in your hand and read the
ingredient clause upon the back label The
law requires that if the powder contains alum
that fact must be there stated. If you find
one of the ingredients named alum, or sul
phate of aluminum, you have found an alum
baking ponder.
There is another and a better way. You
don't have to know the names of the alum
powders. Use Royal Baking Powder only;
that assures you a cream of tartar powder,
and the purest and most healthful baking
powder beyond question.
and they shall not be required to give
security.
