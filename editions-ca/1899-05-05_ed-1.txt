They have found the fieldof labor a most uncongenial one Thetwo officers were received in conference by Maj Gen E S Otis The proposals which they had to submit differed but slightly from those whichthey brought fromthe Filipino commander in the first place They desireda little time in which to summoncongress and expressed themselves asbeing- confident that the congress willdecree peace because the people desirit They represent that Aguinaldo iswithout power to surrender the armyand that the congress must decide thatquestion Incidental the Filipinosenvoys asserted that Aguinaldo hadnot yet made a fair test of his strengthagainst the American forces becauseonly one third of his army had beenassembled togetherThe envoys presented a letter fromSenor Mabini president and ministerf foreign affairs in the cabinet ofAguinaldo and who is the backbone ofthe Filipino organization The communication is personal and unofficialand seconds Maj Argueleseses arguments The envoys

Gen Luna is sincerein his overtures the negotiations aregiving the insurgents a much neededopportunity to rehabilitate their demoralized forces The truth is thatdissentions among the leaders of therebels is helping on the disorganization of the Filipino army almost asmuch as the American campaignIn the course of the conference withthe Filipino envoys Gen Otisagreed with the statement ofMaj Argueieses that the peopleof the Philippine islands wanted peaceand he added that requests for protection are pouring in on him from allparts of the country Maj Gen Lawton was engaged in hard

Public Soon -It is Satisfactory to the PresidentWashington- May 4 The presidentsat up very late Tuesday night goingover the report of the beef court of inquiry and making it ready for publication It is said that it will be givenout within the next 36 hours Thepresident is entirely pleased with theverdict of the court and not only because its findings are satisfactory butbecause the report itself is so strongand convincing in its language as wellas exhaustive in its character that beyond doubt justifies its findingsThe president also believes that thereport by its convincing proof willfor the first time set the vexed question before the public in its rightlight In the first place the presidentsubmitted 20 propositions to the courtthese questions being the g uidancein the inquiry The court hasbrought in its findings in theshape of categorical and explicit answers to each question This has allowed the court to not only show howJen Miles has been wrong and hischarges unfounded but it is enabledto place before the public in a mostconvincing manner the exact conditions and truth in regard to the beefused by the army The following examples give some idea about the reportThe president asked Did the commanding officers in Santiago or PortoRico or the major general commanding report during the war that eitherthe refrigerated beef or canned beefwas an unfit ration fThe court replies that neither GenMiles nor any other commanding officer so reportedWhen were these reports first madeand by whomThis gave the court opportunity topoint out that Gen Miles made no report and never called attention to thematter until months after the warclosed when he made his alienationsbefore the commission on investigation of the war and in the newspapersThe story vf the false scare by DrDaly is set forMi in detail and withscathing criticismIf the allegations from the generalcommanding are established I want thecourt to find the cause and fix the responsibility for the fact that the guiltymay be properly punished the president commandedThe report replies that the allegations have not been established inany degree Gen Miles and otherswho have shared in theorigin and circulation of theseunsustained charges are not sparedTheir conduct is made to appear in itstrue light The president believes thecomplete exposure of this conduct tothe public ought to be sufficient punishment But he will insist that GenMiles and the other officers censuredshall submit to the findings The controversy must end nowSEVERE WISCONSIN STORMSHailstones an Inch in Diameter Fell atBlack River Falls

put off theyse a figure dangling from the yard armwhom they suppose is Capt Selling ring the buccaneer our three friendsf nd themselves in the hands of their oldmate Pradey He treats them kindly andoffers to do them no harm if they will butremain quiet concerning the mutiny heheaded The men consider thir proposition and finally conclude to suggest acompromise viz Agree to cover the villainy till the end of the expeditionCEAPTEE XL ContinuedThe fellow heard it with contractedbrows and a lowering1 look Instead ofanswerinsrat once lie took a turn acrossthe deck stopping- i moment at theother rail and bowing his head as inthought Presently he returned hislook less harsh and the lines of hissunken mouth relaxedNow here is a shrewd trick of bargaining-he began How you musthave overhauled your brains to compass it You would make a compactto last to a dot as long as your necksare in danger Well well it may beall that T could have expected of youand I will not balk at it Let us fetchthe matter to a head then You willswear to me to impart nothing whatever of the matters concerning themutiny neither to Morgan nor to anyperson till such a time as you shalltake ship for England In return Ishall do you no harm and shall recommend you for places in Morgans company or some other Is this as youwould have itWhy yes said Mr Tym who lookedlittle surprised at the ease of the victory You ratify this friendsMac Ivrach and I promptly assentedAnd you swear accordingly wenton PradeyWe do the three of us repliedAs do L for my part he said witha satisfied nod You are row safeand I am free of my complicationsThus all ends wellHe smiled blandly and I supposedthe interview was over but Mr Tym itseemed would have a questionWhat is our present destinationtie inquiredChagre replied Pradey promptlybut first I will run a bit to the eastward he added hoping to fall inwith a homeward bound SpaniardSuch a one might deem it a favorabletime to si ip Out of some Cuban portMr Tym thanked hi for the information and we returned to our ownparts of the shipIt is clear said I as soon as we hadwithdrawn a little and could exchangea word in private that Pradey haifetched around we guessed Hetied our tongues for the present andbefor tisev shall be loosed again-U -3 --aa foreverAye tis so iudeed replied MrTym and we must henceforth be onour guard He is dangerous to thelimit of his abilityIt was now well into the eveningand as we had settled our plans andwere weary we gave over further discussion and went belowWe awoke the next morning muchrefreshed and likewise in improvedspirits Our mates of the steeragewere all on deck and we had an opportunity for a little comforting talkTaking everything into account ourprospects were not after all so verybad The main question was how tooutwit the treacherous and dangerousPradeyWhen we reached the deck we foundthe ship making but a small headwaythe wind having much declined Indeed it soon fell to a calm We lookedvainly for the Pilanca for she hadclean dropped us nor was any other bitof canvas in sight Well to the souththe seaboard was broken for there wemade out what must be land and oninquiry were told it was one of thenorthernmost of the Windwardislands Our course was now due westand Lieut Pliibbert told us we were tocontinue till we raised Cuba If wefell in with no prize by that time hesaid we should stand directly forChagreWe had an easy voyage across theCaribbean and finally made the hindfall of the isthmus All was now stirand excitement for we could not sayhow matters had gone nor whetherMorgan and his fleet were here beforeus It was approaching nightfall aswe drew in and it would be a hard matter to determine much without standing dangerously near but Pradey didnot flinch The wind was almost fromthe north but he coolly held hiscourse taking a desperados chance ofgetting out again and so the BlackEagle drove down till we were withinrange of the glassMy companions and I now allarmed and each furnished with aserviceable cuirass stood near thbreak of the epiarter deck andwatched with eagerness the motionsof the lookouts One fellow was ashigh as the fore topgallant yard andanother a little below The first had aglasyPresently this fellow hailed the deckWhat do you see bawled PradeyThere are seven or eight shipswas the answer and all lying well inby the castleArc they bigIt might be that half are of the sizeof this and the rest lessDo you make out much of the castleand the surroundings inquired PradeyIt looks like a strong place answered the sailor It tops the hilland there is some other work at thefootPradey talked a little with PliibbertPresently he went up to see for himself At the masthead he stopped andleveled his glassThere springs up a light I saidpointing to the now fast rising crestof the hillAs I spoke two or three more glimmers appeared but lower down Theshort tropic sunset was now over andcomparative drrkneas was at handWe stirred not tack nor sheet butheld sturdily on and at last the outlines cf the castle were clear to the unassisted eyeFirst Pradey and then the lookoutscame down and Pliibbert went aftand he and the captain talked brieflytogether The wind now abated a little as the light failed and our speedproport ionally slackenedI fear he stands fair to fall into atrap said I uneasily to my companions Will he still hold onI think not much farther said MrTym but he spoke with no great toneof confidenceA half mile it might be more andthen Pradey called Pliibbert and gavean orderThe lieutenant leaped upon a gunHeady at the braces he roaredThe men rushed to obey The captain then signed to the helmsman andas soon as he had shouted Helmsa lee the lieutenant followed withthe other orders and the ship rodegracefully round At the right moment the yard were ordered andspeedily we were sawing up and downvery comfortably hove toAh look yoaner exclaimed MacIvrach suddenly He pointed to a spota little to the east of the hill Therein a kind of clear space brought out bya glinting streak of the failing night Isaw a small boat It was moving seaward and was already nearly abreastof the shipWe should tell the captain 1 saidMaybe that will be what he seeksVera weel answered the cookHe stepped toward the poop accordingly but at that moment Pradey himself made the discoveryPout he sang out wheeling sharply round Master Phibbert get wavon the shipA fisher said an old buccaneernear me It is the very chanee thecaptain was tarrying forIt seemed so indeed and again I began to think I had underrated Pradeys sagacity In a moment the shipwas readv to come aboutTHE BOURBON NEWS PA1US KYYes senor answered the samevoiceAs the ship came into the wind theboat approached the quarterWhat news ashore asked PradeyhurriedlyWhy senor the English have takenthe castle answered the manAt this we all broke into a greatshoutThe governor and many soldierswere killed went on the man and allof us poor people terribly frightenedEnough cried Pradey impatiently To the braces men Master Phibbert lay our course for the castleAt last Pradey gave the word andonce more the Black Eagle was fetchedinto the wind A cable had been prepared to slip and one of the anchorswas immediately let go Sail wasclewed up but not furled and when ammunition had been served out to themen and all the cannon prepared forinstant use we were in case cither tofight or to fly We were near enoughto the castle by this time so that ashot from one of its heavy guns mightreach us but otherwise there was nopresent riskEverything1 had been managed asquietly as possible and there was nohint from any sign on shore that wehad been perceivedPradey spoke to the first lieutenantand one of the quarter boats was loweredTake her lieutenant pick two menfor a crew and see what you canlearn said Pradey brieflyAye aye sir answered Phibbertlf all is well fire two successive pistol shots if we have been cheatedone pursued PradeyPhibbert again assented and hastilypicked out his men and got away Wewatched them anxiously as long as wecould see them which was only a fewmoments as they speedily entered theshadows of the rivers mouth and under the dark fool of the mountain Itwas again a time of trained waitingbut not for long as much before T wasexpecting anything a sharp reportand then another came out of the obscurityThe men broke into a tremendouscheer and instantly the decks awoketo life The question was settled Thecastle was oursCHAPTEB XIIOF THINGS ASHOREEvery one was speedily in theshrouds or hanging over the bulwarksso eager were all to get the first wordof the newsA light came lifting and sinkingtoward us and we perceived that Phibbert had set off a lanthorn Pradeythereupon hung two answering lightsover the stern In a moment we madeout the dusky shape of the boat andthe indistinct swaying figures of themen at the oars Then the light shotup and we saw Phibbert on his feetholding itA 11 s well he cried as the boatbroke out into our light he eastleis oursThen the men thundered out into another cheer and several excitable onescut two or three steps of a dancePhibbert and hisboatmen came gavlvtip the side and were immediatelybeset with a multitude of qtiestionsNow sir said Phibbert turning toPradey and touching his headpiece Io3 jpHe took another turn across the deckhave the honor to report aptBrodely with 300 men holds tin castleThe governor and most of hi command are dead and we have capturedabove 50 cannon six or eight pipes ofmuskets the value of 4000 or A 5000in treasure and a goodly store of provisionsExcellent cried Pradey in highgood humor And St CatherineSince Brodely is here I trow the chiefremained there which is to sav hetook itHe did indeed sir answered Phibbert but he is not in a way to remaintherelong Brodely had dispatched thenews to him and he must soon comeThis happy conclusion of the matterrelieved Mr Tym Mae Ivrach and mequite as much as it did the rest of theships company The fact is our personal aims were not only therebyfurthered but we felt some little patriotic pride as well Lastly we couldnot forget that it was cowardly Spanish hands that had run poor Capt Sellinger to the yardarmWe did not wait for light the nextThe head sheets were let go the morning but a little past three hastilybraces were handled in their turn andthe forward yards came roundThe other orders were quickly completed The ships head rode gallantly round and she was laid fairly forthe chase The wind was too light formuch speed and as the boat had a goodstart and her haven was near the result must at first be doubtfulIll have her if I ground the shipgrowled Pradey He hung over therail as he spoKe and pulled a piutolfrom his beltdressed and came on deck The windhad hauled round blowing very gentlynow from the shore and we caught thefaint land scents sweet after the longvoyage and were well pleased to partfor a little with the suit briny tangPresently the east yellowed ivi thesea began to glitter and as we turnedlandward a light fcg or vapor splitaway and the embattled top of vhemountain broke throughThe morning watch began to washj down the decks as usual bu withBoat ahoy shouted Pradey He many delays and long looks at thespoke in SpanishBoard the ship bawled back oneof the menshore and while thev were still at workfirst one and then another of iewatch below appeared Pradey andI am going to luff Fetch pbyme I Phibbert soon came out and by theMAT 5 1899I time the sun had his rim fairli borthe water three fourths of the wholecompany were on deckNot to dwell needlesslv on detailswe brought safely in towing with abarge after one tack ad soon anchored iii a little rearward cove Whilewe were fetching by the castle menran out to look at us and the newssoon spreading the ranparts werepresently shining with armored figures who gave us a hearty cheer ofwelcome We found other ships in theberth lying just in the river edge of itand their decks were also speedilymanned and a volley of questions andcongratulations poured outPradey answered all briefly but goodnaturedly but meanwhile gave hischief attention to one Capt De Bouvard from whom he was learning thechief facts of the siege and taking ofthe eastle It seemed that the placewas defended by above 300 Spaniardsnot counting servants and slaves andthat a most stubborn fight was madeCapt Brodely began the attack with aforce of 400 but at noon on the thirdday when the corps du gard was finally carried his available commandnumbered only 30 The Spaniardswere nearly all killed the resolute oldgovernor with the rest and the unhurtremnant managed to descend on thesteep landward side and escape Thewounded and the greater part of thewomen were left behind This was allconcluded about noon two days sinceand word had forthwith been sent toMorganAs soon as we were at our berth andall put in order Pradey called for thegig and was set ashoreHe was gone somewhat less than anhour and when he returned lejoicedus all with the news that we couldhave shore leave Secure as the shipwas it was deemed unnecessary to reserve a guard so that Pradey himselfwith the steward were the onhy onesfinally left behindIt was a gladsome sensation widen Ifinally stepped out upon the solid cuayand I think that Mr Tym and Ma- Ivrach were in accord with me Themorning was not yet far advanced ndit was but moderately warm the airwas pure and the sky nearly cloudlessand before us was the dark strongmountain almost fetching the eye toa little giddiness and yet pleasantlysteadfast while breaking away to theright was the refreshing green of theforestWe made no talk for a bit the othersof the crew pushing speedily on andleaving us and it was only when thelast of them were disappearing in thegateway of the lower forts that wefinally started onTO BE CONTINUEDBURIED PIRATE TREASUREStories of Hidden Hit lies Along theCoasts of Xew Jersey andLong IslandIn almost any rural settlement alongthe coast of Xew Jersey or LongIsland old resident would probably point out to us the blackened andweather beaten ribs of a great shipwhich had been wrecked on the sandbar oft the coast during a terriblestorm long ago he would show uswhere the bathing was pleasant andsafe he would tell us of the best placefor fishing and perhaps show us thehigh bluff a little bnk from the beachfrom which the Indian maiden leapedto escape the tomahawk of her enemyand then he would be almost sure totell us of the secluded spot where itwas said Capt Kidd and his piratesoree buried a lot of treasureIf we should ask why this treasurehad not been dug up he would probably say that if anybody did find itthey never said any tiling about it andit was his opinion that if Capt Kiddever put any gold or silver or preciousstones under the ground on that partof the coast that these treasures wereall there yet Many extensive excavations have been made along the coastsof our northern slates and even inquiet

Maltaaccused her of having violated treatiesand ended by flourishing a cane dangerously near the face of the English embassadorLord Whitworth put his hand on thehilt of his swordWhat would you have done it tireemperor had struck you he was afterward askedI would have felled him to theground was the quiet answerPerhaps the best story told of him isone showing how his quick wit disposedof a rival

important man thisM AdairNot ao very madame replied LordWhitworth although his father was agrand saigneur a remark which readers of French will recognize as a verygood pun for the word as used by

verycurious facts about cats Many personsincluding some of our greatest natrirali6ts believe that our English domesticcat U descended from the Egyptian domestic cat Yet all records go to provethat the cats of Egypt lived in droveswere cared for in droves were fed indroves and worshiped in droves withthe result that Egyptian cats never gotdomesticated or became half as intelligent as oursThe like trnth is suggested from India where monkeyB are worshipedThese are allowed to become nuisancesThey are fed and thefy have any amountof liberty and what is the consequenceThey never lose their innate savageryThe method of caring for them has beenwrong All the devotion and care expended en them are practically wastedand if we treated our cats in the samefashion as the Indians do these monkeysthey would become just as wild and undomesticated Cassells MagazineA Prince as a Railway GuardPrince Chilkow the Russian ministerfor railways commenced his career bymaking a tour of the world in order
