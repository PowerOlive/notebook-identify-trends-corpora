"SJHCHEASED " TAXATION NECESSARY.
"Secretary McAdoo's position rela-
&ffc to taxation for the coming year
-was frankly and positively stated in
Tins letter to Majority Leader Kitchin
mt the House of Representatives. He
-frote in part:
We can not afford to rely upon
-4,000.000,000 only for taxation, be-
tiufii? we shall then have to rely on
freeing $20,000,000,000 by loans.
''SFhls would be a surrender to the
rpollcy of high-interest rates and in
, 2qn, with all their evil conse--vjuences.
"IT we are to preserve the financial
-strength of the Nation we must do
- 'sound and safe things, no matter
-whether they hurt our pockets or in-
- "aolve sacrifices sacrifices of a rela
Vfcively insignificant sort compared
"with those our soldiers and sailors
are making to save the life of the
JNatioh.
""The sound thing to do unquestion-
s?ably is to increase taxation, and the
t increases should be determined upon
-rprampGy and made effective at the
??!srliest-possible moment."
' v Tlie Secretary's recommendations
-TvJjiaefly are that one-third (estimated
-.stSOoO.OOO.OOO) of the cash ex-
- Teaditures to be made during the
:fcsc&l year ending June 30, 1919, be
provided for by taxation, a real war-
. profits' tax at a high rate upon all
yawar profits, a substantial increase in
f&Ei& -amount of norjmal income tax
-opoa all so-called unearned incomes,
,-.. 3Qk3 heavy taxation upon all luxuries.

V-TMSPTNITY AND EYEGLASSES
Curbstone law is that rule of con--""
duct prescribed, practiced and be-
- ' "Sieved in by nine-tenths of the in-
Tuibitants of these States, writes Jos.
"".:L. -"Hooper in Case and Comment. It
- is the quintessence of the common
Tf law the com,monest common law. It
' tr Tests purely on tradition: It has only
-tke sanction of its votaries; but it is
a. legal system, as certainly as the
-iUodo Napoleon.
Curbstone law forbids one man to
'vstrJke another who is wearing eye
jgiasses To.- hit a man wearing
passes is a felony, punishable by im
prisonment for a long term of years.
&. least a hundred times in my prac
lice 3. have heard the unwritten law
expounded. No matter what the
provocation, no matter if he of the
-.eyeglasses is the aggressor, curbstone
llaw-gteps in and says in thunder
'Ucracs: "You dare not swat him! Let
"him alone, or State's prison stares
, , you in the face!"
". ifois immunity has saved many a
'i --man from punishment, whether mer-
Xu4 or not. I have known of only
,-cme iastance where this law was cir-
wciarreated. A man and his wife had
-r.um"altercation with an eyeglass-
'Heteing "boarder, who broadly in-
'sultad the lady. Her husband was
about to, "beat the boarder upon the
"!id when his spouse interposed, say-
?ing: "DonH hit him! He wears
glasses!" Whereupon her husband
-plttcked'the legal talisman fropi the
kxwfler's nose, laid it carefully on a
bjauCaad smote his unglassed op-
gjdmk, "aoee, hip and thigh.

BURN WOOD AND SAVE COAL!
Look the situation squarely in the
face; these are war times and our
country is short of coal 50,000,000
tons short. We mined 50,000,000
extra tons last year but it was all
used in (manufacturing ammunition
and war supplies and in firing bat
tleships and transports. We are still
short 'of coal. The railroads can't
possibly haul as much as we need.
And we are facing another shortage
next winter.
Part of this shortage must be made
up by the use of wood instead of
coal. There is plenty of wood in the
Eastern and Northern States, millions
of cords pf it uncut, ready to be
chopped. But it is practicable only
for the use of farmers and villagers.
Munitions plants cannot burn wood,
warships cannot burn it, nor, be
cause of the transportation problem,
can people living in cities. It would
not help matters, to try to ship wood
by rail. It is too bulky and cars
cannot be spared for carrying it.
Youwho live in rural communities
should cut wood for your next year's
fuel. This is your job. You can
save huge quantities of coal if you
will cut wood, arrange your heating
system to burn it, and make it your
business to see that your community
is awake and doing its bit. The
far,mer who drives an empty wagon to
town and drives back with a load of
coal is driving in the wrong direc
tion. He is a slacker. We don't need
that kind.
The man who would like to burn
coal because it's easier and handier,
but who thinks enough of his coun
try and the boys "over there," so
that he shoulders his axe, spurns the
winter wind and goes out to cut
wood in order to save coal, is helping
to fight the war.
Rural schools and churches, as well
as homes, should restore the old wood
pile and makes themselves sure of
warmth next winter.
This country has lots of wood and
lots of brawn and muscle with which
to handle it. Don't allow this year's
neglect to result in next year's suffer
ing, when a little forethought and a
little added energy will mean comfort
in your home and in that of your
neighbor.
Start the movement. Tell the peo
ple about it. The progressive, patri
otic men in each com,munity must stir
things up. Go to work now and see
that enough wood is ready and sea
soning for next year's use to take
care of the community's wants.
This isn't a time to think of profits,
yet wood can be handledat a very
attractive margin. You know your
own local conditions better than any
one else. But whether you make a
wood-cutting bee or go at it as a
business enterprise cut wood, don't
fail to cut wood!
Save coal to fight the war! ,
Save coal to back our boys!
Cut wood!
Saw wood!
Burn wood!
Lay up wood for next winter!

6 YEARS OLD; TYPES 85 WORDS
A MINUTE.
There is a wonderful story about
a girl 6 years old. Her father has
taught her typewriting since she was
4. She now can do eighty-five words
a minute. The writer of the article
says :
"The Champion Child Typist of the
World is the title Grace Ruth Byers
6-year-old San Francisco tot, has
earned by her record of more than
eighty words a minute on the ma
chine. By the end of the summer
her father, Fred F. Byers, head of a
San Francisco commercial school, ex
pects her to do at least 100 words a
minute. The present world's record
is 143 Avords a minute.
"When she was a little past 4 Mr.
Beyers began practical typewriting
lessons; at first (merely finger exer
cises. She practiced these in twenty
minute periods four times a day. If
her fingers were cold she would dip
them into lukewarm water and then
massage them with cold cream. She
specialized on the most difficult exer
cises, such as keeping the third finger
from the thumb extended while the
others were clinched. She memorized
the different parts of the typewriter,
carriage keys, spacer, shift key, shift
lock, ribbon winder, tabulator and so
on. And she becane familiar with
fvery modern machine.
"When she was 5 years old her
father began taking speed tests of
the child. One of the first results
of these was that she could do thirty
words a minute, coppying from any
material. Since then speed tests have
been taken every day. In June, 1917,
when the child was 5 years old,
she did sixtywords a minute, all per
fect. Although she does now eighty
perfect words a minutes, aid occa
sionally eighty-five, her father be
lieves he could teach her to do 100
words a minute within two weeks."

REVENUE FOR ROADS
If we will only pause for a moment
and observe, it will be apparent to
everyone that the roads in practically
all of the counties are getting worse
each year. There is a reason for
everything, and in this case the prin
cipal reason is the lack of revenue
to maintain the thoroughfares, under
the change in traffic conditions and
increased price of everything that
enters into road work.
The counties jmust have more rev
enue immediately, because if the
matter is very much longer delayed
the entire road system of the various
counties will have to be rebuilt en
tailing an expenditure in most in
stances in each county of several
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The people are not contented with
out roads. They will have roads no
matter what they cost, and when
their entire highway system has been
destroyed they will perhaps wake up,
but it would seem to be very much
better if the people would only take
warning and provide extra revenue

enable the authorities to preserve the
roads while they are in; condition to
be saved.
It is certainly patriotic to main
tain roads at this time,, so as to haul
the products of the farm to .market
as cheaply as possible, and also to re
lieve the congestion of the railroads.
A careful study has been made of
the road conditions in the entire
State and it's known beyond a doubt
that the various counties have not
half enough funds for road purposes.
Other States have increased their
