Modern Awnings
Scarcely any object is more conspic
uous in the summer season than the
awning said Mr BifBeton In none
is our progress in civilization more ap
parent Awning stripes are made now
adays ia a great variety of styles and in
various colors and shades of color It is
quite possible to get an awning to match
a building or one that shall contrast
with it agreeably I have seen lately
a large brownstone building equipped
with awnings having alternate stripes
in two shades of brown shading admi
rably with the stone the whole produc
ing a massive harmonious and pleasing
effect I have seen buildings of light
colored bricks with light stone or terra
cotta trimmings equipped with awnings
in stripes of darker colors and of some
what fanciful design as to the width
and grouping of the stripes giving an
effeec somewhat Etriking perhaps but
decidedly picturesque
The fact is that in the hands of a
competent person the awning may now
easily be made a great embellishment of
the building and properly put up as
indeed most of them are nowadays it
becomes a thingof beauty and a -joy if
not forever at least for the summer
months Exchange
The process of scouring needles bright
takes about a week They are mixed
with oil soft soap and empty pewder
wrapped in loose canvas and placed in
a kind of mangle worked by mechanical
power This scouring process done the
needles are Svashed in hot water and
dried in sawdust

When a new vessel is ready to be fitted now
out with her cushions she is measured gllts special prices -
for them not as a church would be for Special prices on our Ladies and Childrens Shoes and
a certain number of cushions of a spec- blippers in Ian and Black
ified size to supply a certain number of
pews but every space in which a cush
ion is to be placed separately On a
large vessel there might be a number of i
cushions of the same dimensions but
marine architecture is such that cush
ions may be required on the same vessel
in a great variety of forms and of vary
ing dimensions even within given lines
narrower at one end for instance than
at the other And cushions are madeto
fit around masts and around the roundjl
ed ends of cabins and in other spaces
where they must be made in the form
of an arc of a circle and ship Cushions
r are made V shaped and inother shapes
to fit into various nooks and jogs
All cushions are made with a vertical
front edge and most of them are made
with a vertical rear edge but ship
cushions are often made with a rounded
or beveled rear edge to fit handsomely
against the side of the vessel which
serves as a back to the seat but may
slope away at a sharper angle than seat
backs commonly do
Practically every boat that is set
afloat whatever she may be big or lit
tle is individually measured through
out for her cushions The same matpri
als for stuffing cushions that are used
on land are used on the water hair
moss cotton and so on and ship cush
ions are sometimes stuffed with cork
clippings for their buoyant properties
The materials most commonly used in
covering church cushions are damasks
and reps the damasks more generally
The material most commonly used in
covering ship cushions is mohair plush
which is made in various colors and
qualities Leather is also used in cover
ing ship cushions especially in smok
ing rooms and chartrooms and aboard
yachts and it costs little if any more
than a fine quality of mohair plush
