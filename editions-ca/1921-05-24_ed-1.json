was awarded '-to -Cadet

first year of its organization. It was
not until late in the summer, owing
to certain controversies that a fac
ulty was gotten togetner, ana me
school achieved during this first year
far more than it expected. A good
interesting musical program was also
rendered. At the close of the exer
cises Prof. Lancaster read the honors
of 'the year andProf. Jones awarded
the medals. This closed one of the
most brilliant commencements ever

in view of the fact that Miss Haw
kins is suffering from throat
trouble, which calls for an opera
tion as soon as her school work is
completed. On Saturday evening at
the same tipie and place, the young
ladies of the college gave a beautiful
operetta, which was well rendered,
and in many respects was difficult as
well as beautiful. Sunday at 10:30
a. m. Dr. Jones Paul, Vice-President
of Asbury College, at Wilmore,
preached the haccalaurate sermon,
after a well-rendered musical pro
gram, to the fourteen graduates.
His sermon was along the line of ed
ucation and he paid a glowing trib
ute to all schools, who were doing
pure educational work, especially
those who were conducting Christian
education. The High School, the
State Universities and Christian col
leges, were all doing good work and
were necessary, as neither of them
were big enough tnd broad enough
to take care of all the people. Sun
day at 8:00 p. m., Dr. Paul preached
the sermon to the College Missionary
Society, which was exceptionally
good and logical, with no reference
to statistics. It was one of the best
senmons of its kind ever delivered in
Millersburg. '
