as "Honest" Tom Smith in "Beating
the Game," his newest Goldwin
picture at the Alamo and Grand this
afternoon and night, found a way
to open the purse strings of a hesi
tating populace. He also devised a
"Trade at Home" scheme that built
up a town. For his honesty and
earnest efforts, he was elected
Mayor.
Just one year previous, he was an
expert safe cracksman and a fugi
tive from justice.
Western speed is the speediest
speed there is. 'And "Western
Speed," a Fox picture, with Charles
Jones as star, is coming to the Al

production of strength and Ameri
can red-bloodedness, and presents an
unusually absorbing story of love,
flight and adventure.
Agnes Ayres, popular Paramount
star, will be seen at the Alamo and
Grand, Monday afternoon and night
in "The Ordeal," said to be a pow
erful dramatic Paramount picture.
The production was directed by Paul

moments in the action. Conrad

GNADINGER
A message from Chicago to
friends in this city told of the
death in that city of John Gnadin
ger, for many years a resident of
Paris, and well-known to many of
the older generation here. Mr.
Gnadinger had been in declining
health for some time, caused by
hardening of the arteries and a
complication of troubles, though his
family were not aware that his
condition was critical.
Mr. Gnadinger was a son of the
late John Gnadinger, who for many
years conducted a bakery and con
fectionery in the room on Main
street at present occupied by the
Cahal barber shop. He was educat
ed in the public schools of Paris,
and afterward attended 'school in
Lexington and at other points. On
his return from college he assisted
his father in conducting his busi
ness in this city, and was for several
terms in the revenue service as
guager and storekeeper. He was a
young man of many superior at
tainments, and was genial and com
panionable, with a large circle of
friends who regret his passing.
Mr. Gnadinger was a nephew of
Mr. 'A. Gnadinger, of Cynthiana.
His parents, who preceded him to
the grave many years ago, during
their residence in Paris, built the
home on Duncan avenue, at present
occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Wm.. G.
Talbott. After leaving Paris Mr.
Gnadinger moved to Chicago, where
he was engaged in a mercantile
business that brought him financial
success.
Mr. Gnadinger is survived by his
widow, whom he married during his
residence in Chicago. Several
brothers and sisters have died in the
past several years. Mr. Gnadinger
was the eldest of the boys whom
the Paris people will remember
well.
