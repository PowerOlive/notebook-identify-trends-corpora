to ride directly through the enemys fire butmade the passage safely4 Meanwhile Gen Aldave landed 1500mdre men on the farther side andGen Pando with a large force at thistime made a feint upon the upperford Gen Garcia deceived by Pandos movement decided that he couldspare only a small reinforcement to CoLRios and sent Col Carlos Garcia withonly 200 mounted men down the riverThis reinforcement small as it wasrenewed the Hopes of the defenders ofthe Yacta and they charged the Spanish with bayonetsThe Cubans however were so heavily outnumbered that they were forcedto give way Carlos Garcias

upholds the attorneygeneral in all the claims he makes inbehalf of the lawThe fight between the chief of policeand the civil service commission aroseover the fact that when the presentmunicipal administration came intopower the chief of police made his appointments without consulting thecommission and claimed he had a rightto do so The attorney general at oncebrought an action to compel ChiefKipley to abide by the list of the civilservice commission and this he mustnow doThe decision also settles the questionof what constitutes heads of departments by stating that the heau of anydepartment is the man in charge ofthat department He is declared to beexempt from the operation of the lawbut this exemption does not extend tohis subordinates Hereafter the mayoris privileged to appoint the head ofeach citj department and the civilservice commission will control the remainder of the officesAll the appointments which MayorHarrison and Chief of Police Kipleyhave made since they entered theirpresent positions are with the exception of the heads of departments appointed by the mayor now under thisdecision rendered illegal and thechances are that the commission willin a short

Joe Blackburn of Kentuckyis a sturdy admirer of the runninghorse as was his father and a number of ancestors before him A fewevenings ago he related some anecdotes of that good son of LexingtonTom Bowling As everyone knowsBowling was a maneater of the worsttype he being only excelled in thatrespect by Balls Florizel an ancestorDoubtless cruel grooms had much todo with Bowlings bad temper Hekilled and maimed a number of groomsbefore he died The senator said whenBowling was about to be raced it wasworth the price of admission to thetrack to see his trainer and jockeylabor to get him from his stall to thetrack To saddle him was the firsttask which consumed upwards of halfan hour During that period he bitstruck with his front feet and lashedout savagely with his hind onesFinally when all was ready thejockey was thrown on his back Ropeswere attached to each side of his bitand in this condition and with muchback jumping and like antics he wasled to the track When on the trackprevious to the fall of the flag Bowling would spend his time in tryingto get rid of his rider If he failed todislodge him with his teeth he ouldtry to crush his legs against the fenceBowling rarely ever got off with hisfield Usually when the flag fell hewas turned the wrong way of the trackbut when he saw the field was reallyoff the chestnut rogue would whirland follow He was so fleet that hewould give an ordinary field a distance and catch it without seriouslystretching his neck and only the verybest horses of his time could give himany kind of a race When he becamein turf parlance aged although infact young as far as 3rears are countedhe was retired to the stud MarcusDaly of Montana finally purchasedhim and after using him in the studfor some time where he was kept likea caged tiger he was sent back to Kentucky and sold for a mere pittanceBowling kept his savage temper up tothe time of his death which occurreda few months agoLexington the sire of Bowling wasa fair tempered horse as racing thoroughbreds go and yet he was no angelIn the latter years of his life he wassuffered to run in a paddock He seemedto know instinctively when a strangerencroached upon his preserves although his sight had been gone eversince his great victory over Lacompteat 2sTew Orleans At the scund of footsteps he would turn his sightless eyesin the direction from whence theycame and laying back his ears makefor the intruders with his mouth wideopen St Louis RepublicWOMEN AS HUMORISTSThey Can See aJoke But They MakeOne ExceptionThe question has often been propounded Has wotfian as thorough asense of humor as man Does she enjoy the ludicrous as fully This question is never asked by a man- who hasfallen down on the ica in close proximity to a party of ladies It is moregenerally asked by a crusty old bachelor or a person who wants to fill upa page of manuscript For as far asdepth of enjoyment is concerned dailyobservation must convince any impartial observer that a woman does enjoya fine point or a wrhimsical image quiteas much as a manLaughter except that growing outof exuberance of pure joy is apt tobe iconoclastic in its nature It isoften prompted entirely by agents ofdestruction instead of the quieter forcesof harmony A great deal of the merTiuient of the world is produced hysatire Some of this which is the mostamusing is the most abusive andhardest to bear for the individual orsociety at which it is aimed The dubbing of a man or a number of individuals with a name which sadly detracts from their dignity or credit mayfor the moment force a laugh but whenwe think of this name sticking to itsrecipient throughout life it should certainly give us pain With the pleasurable emotions arising from such methodsof provoking laughter it may be acknowledged woman is not as highlyaffected as man But this is not because of her failure to see the ludicrous but rather because of the difficulty she finds in taking pleasure inwhat she knows gives pain to othersHer disinclination to this species ofhumor is not accidental It is notthe characteristic of any one womanJt is partaken of to a very large extent by the whole sex Her actionsprove this She has shone in everyother kind of writing but there neverwas a great woman satirist ChicagoTimes HeraldA Coolc Who EnniM 10000 n YearThere is a celebrate cook in London jabout whom it is said

this fall And remember thatit is not necessary that the ice be verythick in order to keep Ice an inchthick will keep as well as that six inchesthick if one only gets enough of itThe cheapest ice house and for farmuses the best is simply a hole in theground in some location where theearth at the bottom is porous enoughto permit the absorption of the waterfrom the ice as it melts A hole 16 feetsquare at top and 20 feet deep will holdabout 100 two horse wagon loads ofice and it would suffice for the needsof a family through the longest andt hottest summer Anything -that willturn water will do for

the age of sheep At abouta year old two large teeth appear inthe front part of the lower jaw thisindicates a jearling The Englishccurt of law has decided that the appearance of these two teeth marks thechange from a lamb into a sheep Atabout two years old a sheep has fourlarge teeth in the middle part of thflower jaw these however frequentlyappear at 20 months old and occasionally a two-year-old will show ajearling mouth and a yearling a two-year-oldmouth this is natural andreasonable for nature seems to takeaccount of development rather thanage and a sheep that has been pushedto early maturity may reasonably beexpected to show the development inthe teeth At 30 nionths old thereare six large permanent incisorsand at 40 months eight which indicates a iull mouth or a four-year-oldsheep Extreme age is indicated bythe teeth looking like shoe pegs thatis round and long and by a brokenmouth that the sheep has begun losiifg its teeth Dont buy that sheepProf Shaw writes I am satisfiedthat no other line of ordinary farmingat the present time will pay betterthan sheep husbandry provided it isproperly managed Please bear inmind that properly managed maymean very much It ma 3 mean thedifference between failure and a goodprofit and just here lies the difficultyigetting a good man who understandshis business to handle them Sheephusbandr3 is going to extend greattyin the northwest and in the nearfuture man3 will go into the businessand fail because of a deficiency ofknowledge in caring for sheep otherswill succeed A goodly number ofthose who fail at first however willsucceed later if they persevere I seeno reason WI13 250 sheep could not bemaintained on 1C0 acres of good landThis is true of Minnesota soils but Iam not so well acquainted with thescils of other
