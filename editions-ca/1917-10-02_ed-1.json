Under the above heading the
Georgetown News pays the following
deserved tribute to Mr. Gus Margo
len," who was in business in Paris
for several years:
"Twenty-three years ago Mr. Gus
Margolen, the well-known grocery
man, came id this city from Paris
and engaged in the' staple and fancy
grocery business. By industry, hon
esty, hard work and saving procliv
ities, he has become one of George
town's most substantial citizens,- as
well as one ofw its most popular ones.
This week he sold his grocery busi
ness out and and his legion of friends
regret his going ou of business, but
wish for him and his excellent fam
ily all the good things that can come
to them. " .
"Before coming in this city, he
was in business at Paris for ten years
and there he succeeded, as well as
he has done here. Genial hearted
Gus Magrolen deserves a good long
and may he fully enjoy it and al
ways remember wherever he may go
(and let's' hope he don't leave us)
that the latchstring is alwayson the
outside- to him and his family,"
Whereas, Our beloved National
Government is entering a war upon
the outcome of which depends the
preservation of the sancity of wo
manhood and that keystone of civili
zation, the home, as well as the pres
ervation of human liberty and de
mocracy and all the Kentiickians
and Amerioans hold most dear;
And Whereas, Our fathers, sons7
husbands and brothers will soon go
to the battlefront, braving shot and
shell, facing deprivation and suffer--ing
and daunting death that the wo
manhood of Kentucky and America
may never be called upon to face the
horrors' that have been visited upon
the womanhoo'd .of bleeding Belgium
and afflicted France;
And Whereas, T?he world's pro-,
duction of food has been decreased
and its needs increased by the de
mands Of War and unless there be
sacrificial ec6K6my in the home in
American homes and Kentucky
homes our loved ones' atid their
Allies on the battleline and those
for whom they fight at home, may en
dure hunger and even starvation and
the holy crusade for liberty, democ
racy and the sanctity of womanhood
may be in vain;
And Whereas, Our Government,
seeking to avert such ja, catastrophe
for civilisation, is planning a cam-,
paigri througtiut the Nation during
rthe week beginning Oct. 21, 197,
to secure pledges from American fam
ilies' tJ nelp humanity in this war by
co-operation with the Government
in th? conservation of our food sup
Ply; . . '.- .
And Whereas, Mr Fred M. Sackett,
National Food Administrator in Ken
tucky, will' n'eexl the. aid of thousands
of women in our State" in making
the campaign so thorough that no
one who can help in the Old Ken
