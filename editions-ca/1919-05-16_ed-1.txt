The causes which make greater revenuenecessary are due to the new conditions and the new price levels introduced by the war and are entirely beyond the controlof the United States Telegraph and Telephone Administration orof the Telephone Company.More than two years ago the Company foresaw that the telephone system would be operated at a loss unless the ratescould be adjusted to meet the increasing costs of all elementsentering into the production of service. A similar rate adjustment would have been unavoidable under private controland the new rate schedule is practically the same we would havesought in 1918 if the government had not taken possession ofour property.As stated by the Postmaster General, the owners of the telephone system do not benefit in any way from rates changes.Practically all of the increased operating expenses which require this additional revenue are due to increased wages paidto employes to enable them to meet the new conditions of life inthe present day.It is neither practicable nor desirable to reduce wages, and sofar as wages are concerned we believe that portion of the increased operating expenses to be permanent.Th,e new rate schedule is fair and reasonable and the percentage of increased revenue, which it will produce is much lower than the increased cost of other services and commodities ofComplete detailed information about the new rates may beobtained at the manager's office. We are making every effortto change our records promptly, and your courteous consideration will be appreciated.CUMBERLAND TELEPHONEAN TELEGRAPH COMPANY.
