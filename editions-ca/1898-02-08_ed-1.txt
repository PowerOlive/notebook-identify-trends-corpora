credited asreliable The wheat market has turnedlargely upon the operation of a Chicagospeculator but the fact remains thatthe price depends largely upon foreignneeds and upon the comparative scarcity of the American supply The outgo of corn continues heavy37987S6 bushels against 3343400for the same week last yearand the excess over last yearwhen exports were much the greatestever known indicates a

Disposed of First PresidentDole Leaves WashingtonWashington Feb tf The attentiontion of the senate this week will in allprobability be divided between theHawaiian annexation treaty appropriation bills and the right of HonH W Corbett to a seat in the senatefrom Oregon The treaty will probably occupy the great share of attention Monday but after that time thecommittee on appropriations willclaim the time of the senate forthe Indian appropriation which itis expected will be reportedearly in the week This billwill v provoke considerable debateand by the time it is disposed of thecommittee on appropriations hopeto have the fortifications bill beforethe senate Senator Hoar will at the Isame time press the Corbett matter upon the attention of the senate as a matter of the highest privilege and several speeches will be made upon it Itdoes not appear probable howeverthat a vote will be reached during theweek on the Corbett resolutionIt is probable that the programme ofthe house which has been confined almost exclusively this session to theconsideration of appropriation billswill be varied this week with the consideration of a contested election caseIt is the purpose of the house leadersto keep the appropriation bills to thefront in order to obtain an early finaladjournment or as the alternativethrow the responsibility for delays onthe senateBut after the fortifications bill isdisposed of only one other appropriation bill is on the calendar at presentthe military academy and it shouldnot consume more than a few hoursIt is the intention of the leaders therefore to fiU the hiatus this week withthe consideration of the Aldrich-Plow-mancontested election case from theFourth Alabama district The elections committee have divided on thiscase on partjr lines and the indications are therefore that the house willdo the same thing and Mr Bowmanwill be unseated The members onboth sides of the house have been usingthe latitude allowed in debate on appropriation bills to make campaign speeches to be used more or less extensivelyin the impending congressional campaign this fall and these are likely tocontinue indefinitely All the membersare keenly alive to opportunities tomake political capital for themselvesor their party and this fact may at anytime upset prearranged programmesby plunging the house into rancorous aud acrimonious political discussion

the hope that Mary would accept him In his slow honest deliberate way he went all over the situationin his own mind He knew Dons worthand he had felt as had everybody whohad come in contact with him the attraction of the young fishermanssweet kind careless nature He knewall that with no jealousy or bitternesswith only a sober kindly acceptance ofthe fact He admitted the loyalty ofMarys heart and I like her all thebetter he said to himself stoutly Heeven realized in an exact reasoningway the force of Marys ideal of Donand the longer she waits the moreshell care for him he thought soberly He must not lose any time thatwas clear So he tried a dozen lovingartifices he called not too often Hecarried fruit to Mrs Hayes he sentbooks to Mary anJ after awhile toput her at ease he talked to her aboutDon and showed the affection whichhe had always felt for himIt all seemed so natural to Mary thatshe began to feel as he meant that sheshould that he was a friendHes forgotten all that nonsenseshe told herself and grew to depend onhis friendship She was quite unembarrassed when she chanced to be alonewith him if he met her as she waswalking honse from school or if hefound her sitting alone on the beachher hands locked about her knees hereyes on the far line of the horizon behind which Dons sails had dimmedand dipped and disappeared foreverAnother year passed in this wayDick never spoke but he went on loving When at last he tried to speakher perfect friendliness closed his lipsId better get shipwrecked he toldhimself with a little bitterness whichwas foreign to his patient nature if Iwas dead shed think more of me Hedid not give up hope but he was discouraged He hardly knew himselfhow deeply so for he was surprised tofind himself half sick and by and byaltogether sick down with a feverhis man said when he came to bring apair of chickens to Mrs Hayes doorand explain that Mr Wheeler couldntcome himselfPoor boy cried Mrs Hayes anxiously and not a wife nor a mother totake care of him Well there Mary itis too bad Mary looked sorry and thenext day she went to inquire about himWell hes worse said the hiredman laconically Mary took the newsback to Dons mother and was very silentBout time to be concerned oldMrs Hayes thought severely but thatas only for a moment Poor childshe said to herself shes worried aboutbira There now Mary cheer upJfrf DCOPYRIGHTEDCHAPTER II ContinuedMarys face was still flushed whenshe came into the kitchen and foundMrs Hayes trotting- about making- biscuits for tea The little old womanlooked at her keenly for a moment shehad her suspicions and her hopesDick Wheeler had stepped in earlier inthe afternoon to ask how she did topass the time of day Mrs Hayessaid and in a casual way had askedwhen Mary would be in He wants tomeet her and walk home with hershe chuckled to herself well wellthats right Thats how it ought be Ihope the child will take himThere was a curious inconsistencyabout Dons mother She loved Maryfor her faithfulness to Don but whyshould the girl lose a good chanceShe had no small fears of any discomfort to herself any neglect she knewMary So with the best will in theworld she tried to further Dicks suitShe talked about him a good deal hismoney his providence his good heartand the fine bow window he had builtin his dining roomDick hes all for use and comfortand his wife she reminded Mary withvast significance will be more comfortable than most folks She wonthave to carry water in from the wellthe way you do here hes got it run-ning in the kitchenThere are worse things than carrying in the water from the well Marysaid decidedly and Mrs Hayes said totshe said altJudvery bad4I guess it aint nothinI dont know Mary answered Ihope not But Im afraid it is Andthen later in the evening when theyhad been talking of something else shesaid suddenly He hasnt a soul tolook after him except thatJ stupidJacobMrs Hayes looked at her inquiringlyI just wish said Mary tremulouslythat you and I couldWhy bless your heart cried theold woman we will I know whatyoure going to say well go right upthere to morrow I dont know why Ididnt think of it first 0Good nursing is well enough in itsway but when added to good nursingthe invalid hears a voice that he lovestalking outside his door to his littleold kind nurse or is told that Marymade that gruel or watches dreamily through feverish eyes Mary moving about his room or even feels hertouch upon his forehead why he cannot help get well At least that waswhat Dick Wheeler said first to himself and afterwards shyly and awkwardly when he was better and wassitting up to Mary But poor fellowMarys blank look almost landed himback in his bed again He began torealize in a slow pathetic way that ifshe had been less kind he might havehad more hope And Don dead sevenyears he told himself as he satpropped up with pillows in a big blackwooden rocking chair that had rosespainted on the head rest and gay calico sleeves tied over its stiff armsIt was a soft spring afternoon hewas much better Mrs Hayes andMary had gone home and only came infor an hour or two each day to see thathe was comfortable It was MrsHayes who had packed him snugly intothe big chair in the south window andput a footstool under his feet anddrawn a little table with his medicineand a glass of water close to his sideJacobll help you back to bed Dickyas soon as you feel tired now minddont sit up a minute longer than youfeel like it And Ill come in to morrowmorning and bring some beef teaMarys great on making beef teaWhen she went away Dick sat therein the sunshine looking out of the window He made up his mind that hemust get over thinking about Marythere was no use it only worried herMand it kills me he thought simplyHe wondered if he could always feel sodully indifferent to everything just because he couldnt have Mary The sunwas warm on the grassy slope in frontof the house a big vessel coming slowlyup the river with the tide leaned andher white topsails swelled and gleamedand flapped loose again the trees atthe foot of the garden showed a faintmist of green a pigeon- wheeled andfluttered down to the doorstep and satpreening itself and puffing out its whitebreast The feeling of spring and joyand promise was in the airgroaned to himself Well Ive got toget over this Ill go away Ill get outof it Mary shant know why Ill let Jher think Ive never thought of hersince the last time I spoke Good Lordit was two or three years ago andIve not gained an inch with her Andthen he opened his eyes and saw Marycoming up the path she was on herway home from school and stopped toknow how he was getting alongLook at you you careless fellowshe scolded youve dropped thatshawl off your knees what wouldMother Hayes sayOh Mary he said and somehowthe tears stood in his eyes he was soweak I Ive got to go awayMarys instant look of concern andlight touch upon his wrist showedwhat she thought of such crazy wordsand poor Dick gulped and tried to getback to his resolution not to tell herI dont know why I said that I didntmean to he told herYou are tired she said soothingly youve been sitting up too longNothing of the sort Dick answered crossly I am only tired ofthis business Good Lord Mary thereI cant help it will you take me I didntmean to ask again I was just saying ISITTING AXONR ON THE BEACHwouldnt when you came up the pathMary will you take ine If you wontIm going off Ive stood this just aslong as Im going toPoor Mary turned red and whitewith pity Oh Dick she saidYou know hes dead and goneyoure only

spring dusk her eyes blurringand smarting She did not want Donsmother to know she had been cryingTso left the path and sat down under alittle pine tree that clutched at therocks and stretched its starved leanbranches out over the tumbling foambelow She and Don had often sathere and listened to the steady beat ofthe waves on the broken rocks Thelight paled and faded and the seagrew gray and coldj far off a sailleaned like a wing against the sky andcaught a sudden flush from the glow mthe west How often she had watchedDons bpat beating inv when the twilight was settling over the lonely shoreHe used to know without seeing herthat she was there under the pineShe wondered if he knew that Dickhad asked her to marry him The seawas quite dark except where a faintwreath of white came and went wherathe waves broke on the rocks Howdear and kind Don had been how fullof laughter how simple and trustinghow careless and good natured she remembered this or that drollery this orthat dear unreasonableness a hundredtendernesses No wonder she lovedhim to love such a man was enoughfor one girls life she thought Andyet Dick Wheeler had thought shemight marry himBut Ive been true she protestedto herself as if in excuse Then sheturned back to the path and went onto the little gray house Don thoughtit wasnt as nice as Dicks shethought half smiling well you seeIve chosen it anyhow she said halfaloud as though he were beside herShe saw the kitchen door open andshut and heard a burst of laughterWhy who is here at this time ofnight jhe thought And then shesaw that there were people in the dooryard and two figures at the gate suddenly saw her and came runningtowards herMary hes back Mary DonshomeMary stood still at the gate she wasperfectly silent Eager hands clutchedher

second time to day His firstvisit was in 1867 when the westernterminus of the Kock Island roadlanded passengers a little west of DesMoines la and the old Concord stagewas the only means of passage on toOmaha To be sure the old HannibalSt Joe road in connection with the iriver boats between St Joseph andOmaha afforded an easier means ofreaching the Nebraska metropolisThere was then no railroad bridge atOmaha and the incoming passengershad to be ferried across the river Thegreat transcontinental line the UnionPacific was then under constructionIts material and rolling stock had to betransported on barges up the riverWhen President Lincoln designatedOmaha as the eastern terminus of theUnion Pacific line he fixed the destinyof this city And I remember that thepeople here were exultant and confident that this act of Old Abe consummated after a personal inspection of thetopography of competing sites alongthe river would put Omaha on thehigh road to fortune and make it ultimately the largest city between Chicago and San Francisco This prediction has been realized Three bridgesnow span the river at this point and 14railways enter the gates of OmahaWhen I first saw Omaha the populationwas estimated at 15000 To day tentimes that number is claimed while thepopulation of Nebraska has grown toa million and a quarterAt that time Omaha was an cutpostof the frontier To day there are 15000000 people west of the river Nebraska had been admitted to statehooda few months prior to my visit andwith the exception cf Kansas Texasdesign of buildings and the scheme oicolor I

upon my mind What will thisvast display of architecture cost andhow is it possible that funds sufficientto complete the work laid out can beraised in a section of country which buttwo 3ears ago I was told down easthad suffered immeasurably fromdrought and business depression no lessdisastrous to the west than to the eastI was not prepared to believe that anexposition planned on a scale so gigantic could be pushed to a successfulissue under conditions which to mymind were far from favorable Seeking information on this point I wastold by one of the chief officials that thetotal cost of construction may notreach a sum exceeding a million and ahalf and that nearly 1000000 is insight to say nothing of the revenuesifroni concessionaires gate receipts andappropriations from the various stateswhich will participate The people ofOmaha alone subscribed over half a milliondollars to this enterprise and I amtold that a bankers committee scannedthe subscription list and adjudged it95 per

termfrontier has become a misnomer andthe arts and industries of civilization Jhave pushed out to the Rockies and beyondThere has been no fit illustration ofthe marvelous progress made by thestates west of the Mississippi river during the past 25 years True the Columbian fair gave evidence in slight measure of western development but manyof the states and territories were represented there only by buildings for theentertainment of visitors from the several states and an inadequate representation of the wealth products itsources and civilization of the vast ngion west of the Mississippi has yeto be madeI had been told that the Trans-MississippiInternational exposition whichis billed to open its gates at Omahanext June promises to be second onlyto the Worlds fair but I must confess I was somewhat skeptical on thispoint I took a trolley car to thegrounds which are about iy2 milesnorth of the center of the city butwithin the corporate limits I foundsome of the large buildings nearingcompletion They are ranged east andwest along either side of a basinnearly half a mile long and about 150feet wide At the west end thisbasin spreads out into a three lcbedlake facing which is the United Statesgovernment building which the contractor is rearing with all possible dispatch the winter weather being favorable This building by the way isto be 500 feet long and the height topinnacle will be 178 feet Its cost isestimated at 50000 At the east endof the basin there is an immense hemioycle stairway leading to a viaductacross Sh erman avenue which dividesthe main tract of the exposition froma beautiful plat of about 60 acreswherein are being erected the variousState buildings the horticulture apiaryand other buildings of lesser degreeThis tract overlooks the river and being high and sightly affords a magnificent view of the river and the Iowabluffs beyond At the northern extremity begins the section devoted to amusements of concessionaires and over to thewet being

holding of this expositionHow about the attendance This isa vital point When I was told thatthe estimated figure is 2500000 of admissions I could not see it EdwardRosewater manager of the departmentof publicity and promotion told me thatas a matter of course the bulk of theattendance isxpeeted from the territory within a radius of 300 to 500miles and that the census populationof Nebraska and states touching itsborders is something like 9000000From the railroad people I learri thatall signs point to an enormous attendance Agents of the exposition in everypart of the country send reports of thisnature The people out here think thatif business conditions continue to improve the question of a large attendance throughout the five months of theexposition will never vex the management Jw B

work inaccordance with the principles of another art and at last they have succeeded in convincing the more open mindedf us that what is of prime importuncein a picture is the way in which it ispainted and that its merely literarymerit is quite secondary They are notunreasonable when they insist that thechief duty of a picture is to represent avisible world and not to point a moralor adorn a tale and that in the apprerciation of a picture we must first weighall of its pictorial beauty Nor are thesculptors asking too much when in astatue they want us to consider chieflyits plastic beautyNow the orator and the dramatistask for themselves what has been granted the painter and the sculptor theyrequest that an oration or a dramashall be judged not as literature onlybut in accordance with the principlesof its own art And here the literarycritic is even less willing to yield Hemay acknowledge his own ignorancfcof perspective and of pigments of composition and of modeling he may con-fpBC Vf Tiotp Vio TvoiTi hnT a nr rf Viav x 5sculptor have him at a disadvantagebut he is not ready to admit that he -5s not to apply his own standards to theworks of the orator and of the dramatist On tho contrary he maintainsthat the speech and the play if they belong to literature at all are by that veryfact absolutely within the province ofthe literary critie He cannot see whythat which the orator and dramatistmay write is not to be read and criticised exactly as that which is writtenby the novelist and the essayist and thepoet Indeed it is almost a misrepresentation of the literary critics attitude to suggest that he has need tomaintain this position for it is rarelyeven hinted to him that he is not fullyjustified in employing the same tests inevery department of literatureYet nothing ought to be clearer thanthe distinction between the writtenword and the spofcen between thaliterature which is addressed to the feye alone and that which is intendedprimarily for the ear and only second- karily for the eye It is the differencebetween words written once for all andwords first spoken and then writtenor at least written so that they may bespoken When this distinction is seizedit follows that oral discourse- is notnecessarily to be measured on the samescale as written discourse It followsalso that the speech and the play maybe very good indeed each in its kindalthough they may fail to attain thestandard of strictly literary meritwhich we should demand in an essaya story or a poem Prof Brander Matihews in ForumHorse Hair from SiberiaThree hundred

roadside at Blue Springs not farfrom the geographical and iniquitouscenter of the county And why iniquitous center with a church atnand The egg of much devilmenthad been laid and hatched in that oldchurch at the dead of night while thelaw abiding citizen of the county wassound asleep with his pistol under hislead One night a rough dance wasgiven therein It was mastered bythe Lighthorn boys and the law wasafraid to open its mouth in objectionthough it was a disgrace and an outrage upon those who believed in theLord The dance was at its heightand Abe Lighthorn was cutting highcapers with Beity Sowers when instepped old man Dagley deacon of thechurch In his arms he carried abundle of split wood and - a wisp ofhay He put his burden into a cornerand began to pile bench legs and piecesof

convincing boxer andiis pistol shooting had beena performance of wonderfulBut he had put asde these proTfane practices and it must be acknowledged that he was sincere The belief that he could accomplish a greatgood by preaching had become a partof his nature and was therefore strongAnd it was Sir Tony whom the deacon found The old man made no effortto give a smooth picture of a

Requirements That Will BeFound IndispensableThe universal article of diet in thatcountry depended upon and indispensable is bread or biscuit And tomakethebread and biscuit either in the camp orupon the trail yeast cannot be used itmust be baking powder and the powder manufactured by the processes ofthe Eoyal Baking Powder Companyminers and prospectors have learnedis the only one which will stand in thatpeculiar climate of cold and dampnessand raise the bread and biscuit satisfactorilyThese facts are very important forevery one proposing to go to Alaska andthe Yukon country to know for shouldhe be persuaded by some outfitter totake one of the cheap brands of bakingpowder it will cost just as much totransport it and then when he opens itfor use after all his labor in packing itover the long and difficult route he willfind a solid caked mass or a lot of spoiledpowder with no strength and uselessSuch a mistake might lead to the mostserious results Alaska is no place inwhich to experiment in food or try toeconomize with your stomach For usein such a climate and under the tryingand fatiguing conditions of life andlabor in that country everything mustbe the best and most useful and aboveall it is imperative that all food suppliesshall have perfect keeping qualities Itis absurd to convey over such difficultand expensive routes an article thatwill deteriorate in transit or that willbe found when required for use to havelost a great part of its valueThere is no better guide to followin these matters than the ad vice of thosewho have gone through similar experience Mr McQuesten who iscalledthefather of Alaska after an experienceof years upon the trail in the camp andin the use of every kind of supply saysWe find in Alaska that the importanceof a proper kind of baking powder cannot be overestimated A miner with acan of bad baking powder is almosthelpless in Alaska We have tried allsorts and have been obliged to settledown to use nothing but Eoyal Itis stronger and carries further butabove all things it is the only powderthat will endure the severe climaticchanges of the Arctic regionIt is for the same reasons that the US Government in its relief expeditionsand Peary the famous Arctic travelerhave carried the Eoyal Baking PowderexclusivelyThe Eoyal Baking Powder will notcake nor lose its strength either onboard ship or in damp climates and isthe most hightly concentrated and efficient of leavening agents Hence it isindispensable to every Alaskan outfitIt can be had of any of the trading companies in Alaska but should the minerprocure his supplies before leaving heshould resist every attempt of the outfitter to palm off upon him any of theother brands of baking powder for theywill spoil and prove the cause of greatdisappointment

flock for 20000 The other andbiggest half of the flock fed the birdsof the arctic zone This is how it happenedHe drove the sheep in over the Dalton trail Some time before Dawsonwas reached cold weather came on andCollins decided to kill his sheep Hekilled and sold 300 and received nearly20000 for themThen he concluded to hold the remainder for a better market He killedthe remaining 400 in a sort of secludedplace off the line of travel and suspended the carcasses on poles far enoughabove the ground to be out of the reachof bears wolves or other wild animalsHe left two young men to watch themutton and proceeded to look for amining section Having found one helocated a claim and proceeded to testit After he had dug out a few thousand dollars worth of gold he thoughthe would as the French say returnto his muttonsHis stay had been so prolonged thatthe young men had become weary ofholding a wake over the sheep andimagining Dawson to be only a fewmiles away had started for that cityto enjoy some of the pleasures a metropolitan city can afford It proved tobe about 100 miles to Dawson so theirabsence was more extended than theyhad inended and when Collins reachedthe place where he had left the carcasses of 400 sheep he foumd only 400bleaching skeletonsThe eagles ravens crows kiteshawks and other birds of prey whichinhabit that region had been feastingon mutton Where the carcass isthere will the eagles be gathered isa proverb which applies to other birdsof prey Collins had left so many carcasses that invitations had been sentout and a general round up of all thevultures amd things in that region fromBehring sea to the Mackenzie river hadtaken place Whether the claim Collins secured will make good the lossof the mutton or not remains to be seenbut when he drives in his next band ofcheep the birds of prey will not getso large a percentage of them Portland OreijonianvA Town Rides in This ElevatorProbably the only elevator in theworld that is used to
