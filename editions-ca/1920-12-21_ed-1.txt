DAVIS ANSWERSDEATH ANGEL'S SUMMONSEarth Gives Bck To Heaven AChristiaii's SoulThe final debt to Nature, the summons to the Great Beyond, as a. fitting reward for a long and usefullife, came at ten o'clock Saturdaynight to George W. Davis, Paris'grand old man, pioneer businesaman and Christian erentleman.known and revered by every man,woman and child in .Parte. Mr.Davis had been an invalid for thepast two years,, being unable toleave his home. Doath came as theresult of the burden of years, hehaving passed the ninety-third milestone in a life journey filled wirh'ares, sorrowsand trials, yet whichhad ifs ilver ln-ing, a life illuminedwith the bright sun of a Christian'sfaith. .The funeral was held at thePresbyterian church, yesteiday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock, with services conducted by Rev. Theodore y.Smylie, pastor, assisted by Rev.Frank J. Cheek, of Danville, a lifelong friend of Mr. Davis. The inlerment followed on the family lot inthe Pari- Cemetery, where the commitment services ar. the grave wereconducted by members of BourbonLodge, No. 26, I. O. O. F., the lodgeattending in a body. The pall-bearerswere elders in the Presbyterianchurch, R. P. Dow. Dr. J. T. Vansant, James Dodge, Robert Meteer,James D. McCIintock, Sam Wiilisand Wallace W. Mitchell.George W. Davis was born SnParis on February 6, 1827. He wasa son of George M. Davis, one of thepioneer residents of Bourbon county,J who settled in Ruddles Mills at anearly period in its history. He rceived his early training in theschools of his day. In 1843 be wasapprenticed to J. P. Kern to learntho cabinet rcraking business, atwhich he continued until he hadfinished his apprenticeship. In 1848ho went into business for himself,being compelled to do so by the factthat his employer went out of business and left no opening for a youngcabinet moker, such as Mr. Daviswas.When he first began there were norailroads in this section and practically all the furniture used in Bour inon and srfnie of the surroundingfountfcs was manufactured by Air.Djavis. Mr. Davis had a number ofapprentices learning the trade,among them John T. Hinton, afterward one of the wealthiest and mostinfluential business men of Paris.Air. Davis continued in the furnitureand undertaking business until forced to 'retire because of advancing1age and ill-health, the business beingconducted in his name by his sens,George R. Davte and RudolphDavis. He was a devoted memberof the Presbyterian church, for years3uperintendent of the Sunhtdschool and for almost the full periodof hislcng life ai elder in thechurch. He was the oldest livingmqmber of Bourbon Lodge I. O. O.P., of Paris.In 1851 he was married to HelenaMiller, daughter of Jacob and JuliaMiller. To this union eight children were born, three of whom areliving, George R. Davis, Owen LDavis and Rudolph Davis, all ot tinsMr. Davis was a man of generousimpulses, and h's was a heart ofgold. He never forgot the dues ofhospitality. He was at homo by thebedside of the sick and delighted inall kinds of neighborly offices. Hehad borne adversity bravely andenjoyed prosperity, quietly. He hadfilled the various relations of life,as son, father, husband, brother andfriend and had filled them well.There was a daily beauty about hislife which won every heart. Iptemperament he was mild, conciliatory and candid, and yet had an uneomprojmising fiimress. He gainedconfidence when and where he seemed least to seek it. He believed i?tthe fatherhoood of God and thebrotherhood of man. He believedthat the man 'or woman who let intothe dark places of life the sunshineof human sympathy and human happiness, was following in the footstepsof his Master, and he practiced thisin his daily life. He at all times andunder all circumstances walked inthe well-beaten path of, righteousness. In the last moments the brightfaith that had sustained him through'life grew brighter and brighter ashe approached the Infinite, and thefinal . gloom ot eath wasdissoyedbefore the radiance of that faith.Could we all live the just and upright life, Mr. Davis lived, and diedin his trusting faith, death could 'nolonsrer be called "The Kingf of Terrors." fr he inspired no terrorihereHis death has brought the bittercup of Forrow to the lips of friends;nd relatives. But behind the clouds-j God's farewell to the day, smilingalways lurks the sunshine. Dark- ; with all the well-repnembered graceness precedes the da-wning and out I of his manhood, love and devotion,of the blackness of night comes theand saying to us:sunshine ar.d joy of the day.

It was diuvgerons and dirty work. One day thedam broke. A number of workmenwere caught and sucked under by theInrush of water. They all came to thesurface and were rescued but one.This poor chap disappeared and theywere unable to find his body, althoughdiligent search was made.After the cofferdam was repairedthe water, pumped out the bodyof the missing man was found burledin the muddy bottom.The reason, he did not rise to thesurface with the rest was that he hadfastened about his waist a belt containing $1,250 in gold.His money belt was his bank and Intrying to save 'his money he lost hislife, Charles Aubrey Eaton writes inLeslie's.Around the Pittsburgh district theyget their building sand by dredging theriver bottoms. Not long ago a workman on one of the dredging scowsfound in the sand brought up by thedredge, a leather pocketbook containing $1,700. He reported his find to theboss and the company advertised forthe owner of the money. 'A Hungarian laborer from one of thebig manufacturing plants answered theadvertisement and claimed the money.The story told by this man was extraordinary. He had made the pocketbook himself at home out of a piece ofleather uhich he had bought for thepurpose. He produced the remnant ofthe original piece of leather as partof his proof of ownership. One dayho had accidentally dropped his pocketbook down a manhole into a streetsewer. He went to the spot where thesewer empties into the river and without food or drink watched for threedays and nights, in the hope that thepocketbook would come through to theriver. At last he gave up in despairand it was more than a year later thatthe workman on the dredge fished thething up out of the river bottom.A foreign-born workman was hurt ina western Pennsylvania mine. Whenhe was brought to the surface fortreatmeut they found that he had fastened under his left arm an oiled skinsilk bag containing $4."0.One day during the war I spoke toa 'crowd of fi.000 workmen In an east"ifern shipyard. After the meeting anItalian laborer came to me and askedhe could speak to me in private.We retired behind a pile of lumber andhe produced $500 worth of libertybonds which he had been carrying ina belt next to his body and whichwere becoming soiled and discolored.He wanted to know where he couldput his bonds for safekeeping, as hewas afraid they would be stolen if hecarried them around him at his work.I took him to the president of thecompany and suggested that his dutywas only half done when he had educated the workers to Invest in government securities. He ought then togo on and show the men how to takecare of their securities by depositingthem in some good bank.Jefferson in Misfortune.When Thomas Jefferson retired fromthe presidency and returned to Monticello he was much in debt, though atthe time the fact was not know tomost of his friends. He emulated theexample of Washington by trying tobe a farmer, but was so far unsuccessful that each year he ran more behindfinancially. In the meantime he waskeeping open houe. entertaining lavishly and sometimes having as manyas Ofty guests.At length his affairs got into suchbad -shape that he was compelled toak congress to buy his library andhistorical papers, which were thereupon sold to the nation for $2S,000.These books and papers now form oneof the most valuable possessions ofthe library of congress. The moneytided Jefferson over for a while, buthe was bankrupt when he died, 37years after his departure from theWhite House. To the day of his- deathhe took an active interest in publicaffairs. He established the University of Virginia, -serving as its tirstprovost, and personally superintendedthe erection of its buildings.Roman Villas Found in Switzerland.Archaeologists have discovered inthe wood of Enge, near Berne Switzerland,, two Roman villas which appearto have been constructed In the firstcentury, B.
