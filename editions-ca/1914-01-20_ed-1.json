"A Man and A Woman," (Reliance)
This is a remarkably powerful
story of the "red blood" type, which
deals in a surprising way with the fet
ters of convention. It is well acted by
Seigmann as "The Ivlan" and Irene
Hunt as "The Woman."
The woman is a society girl, and
the man is a stoker on a steamer.
They are washed ashore on a small
island in the Pacific when their ves
sel is wrecked, and are the only hu
man beings there. The girl at first
fears the man, because she realizes
that she is absolutely in his power,
but gradually she 'changes her atti
tude. Freed of the trammeling con
ventions of human society she falls
in love with the man. When they
are resqued after several months the
man tells the girl tnathewill go back
to the stoke hole and she will be
hailed as a heroine. It turns out as
he says, and the picture closes with
the woman in her palatial home,
thinking wistfully of the happy days
on the tropic island, and hoping that
the man will make good as he prom
ised and some day come to her.
"The Occult," (American) Featur
ing Sydney Ayer. An intense drama
replete with mystery. Another fun
ny Keystone will be shown today, en
titled "Our Children."
(adv)
"Within the Law." at Paris Grand.
Local theatre-goers are certain to
manifest great interest in the an
nouncement that Bayard Veiller's ex
citing new play of modern American
life, "Within the Law," which Is the
reigning dramatic sensation of New
York and Chicago, will be given its
first presentation here, under the
managerial direction of the American
Play Co., at the Paris Grand, on Mon
day, January 26.
In this gripping drama of thrills
there is adopted for the first time for
use on the stage smokeless powder
and a Maxim sileucer, such as the ac
complices of the McNamara dynamit
ers are alleged to have employed to
rid themselves of persons who might
hamper their plans. These ingenious
instruments 'of death add consider
ably to the mystery the police are
called upon to solve in the play a
mystery they might never have fath
omed but for the sacrifice of a pro
fesional criminal who takes the blame
upon himself and goes willingly to
his punishment out of unselfish devo
tion to a young woman who stood by
him when he was in peril before. As
a background for this story is the so
cial problem of the person who is
convicted of a crime, goes to prison
and serves his sentence in full, only
to be persecuted by the police and
hounded away from the endeavor to .
earn a .reputable livelihood.
"Within the Law" exercises an al-1
most irresistable human appeal on all
classes of theatre-goers, and is said !
to be one of the most exciting theat
rical offerings of many years. An
admirably fine cast appears, while the
ornate scenic embellishment afforded
"Within the Law" by the American
Play Company is ns elaborate as
might he expected from the produc
ers whose standard of aitistic excel
lence is so well-known.
