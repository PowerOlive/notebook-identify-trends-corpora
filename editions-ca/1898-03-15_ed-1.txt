CaptPeral president of the Spanish navalcourt of inquiry into the cause of theMaine disaster granted an interviewto a correspondent who he authorizedto say that it was the first and only interview he had given to anj newspaper on the subject of the inquiryCapt Peral saidOur divers are hard at work examining thehull of the Maine Great difficulty is experienced owing to the deep mud in which the hullis buried and the condition of the wreck forward of amidships The whole forward partof the ship is a mass of iron and steel debrisWe have hoisted up much of it but in the mudit is not always possible to tell what parts ofthe ships armor decks beams or stanchionsare found the explosion so changed their positionWe think we have located the ram or prowbut not in the position supposed The forwardturret mounting two large guns was blownclear of the hull into the water on the starboardWe shall continue our work and try to examine the hull forward down to the keel It ispossible that we may propose to the Americanauthorities to raise the hull by means of thefloating dock brought from England and nowin Havana harborWe can no i believe there was an externalexplosion of a torpedo for the following reasonsA torpedo following the line of least resistance must have blown a great hole in themud at the bottom of the harbor No suchhole was foundA torpedo must have thrown a large massof water into the air if exploded at a depth ofonly 25 feet or so or at least have produced awave reaching the other ships and the shore ofthe harbor We have examined every one onshipboard or shore who saw the explosion hutno one can be found who remarked any upheaval of the water or a big wave A torpedoexplosion always kills fish in the vicinity Nofish were killed by the Maine disaster as fishermen who have known the harbor for manyyears testify To produce the effects noted inthe wreck a torpedo would have to be of enormous size fully 150 or 200 kilosI am therefore of opinion that the explosion occurred within the ship I know and respect Capt Sigsbee and I believe the American regulations affecting naval conduct whichI have read and found admirable were carefully observed But some things which cannot be foreseen are bound to happen in anynavyIt should be borne in mind that thisis the first and only interview he hasgiven any one Capt Peral requestedthis correspondent to make it knownthat he had granted the interview inhis unofficial capacity and not as president of the Spanish court of inquirywhich the law forbids him to doPASSED AWAYGen IV S Rosecrans Dies at His HomeNear

14 There is noprepared programme for the senatefor the present week If SenatorBacon is prepared to speak on theHawaiian annexation treaty it will betaken up promptly as indeed it willbe if any senator is prepared to go onwith the debate It is not expectedhowever that there will be muchfurther discussion on this subject inexecutive session and it is the intention of Senator Davis chairman of thesenate com mittee on foreign relationsat a very early day to move tolay Senator Bacons plebesciteamendment upon the table Itis upon this motion thatthe managers of the treaty hope tosecure a test vote and Senator Davissaid Sunday that he was hopeful thatthis vote might be reached during thepresent week Senator Pettigrew isanxious and expects to get his five percent land bill before the senate earlyin the week and Senator Vest willmake an effort to secure consideration of the quarantine billThere is also a possibility thatthe census bill may be pressedfor consideration An entirelynew census bill probably will be offered providing for the immediate establishment of the census machinery instead of making preliminary arrangements for it as the bill first prepareddid The committee on appropriationsis hopeful of being able to report theSundry civil bill during the week andif it should be successful this measurewill be pressed upon the attention ofthe senate to the exclusion of everything elseThe programme of the house thisweek as mapped out would be completely changed if any move is made inconnection with the Spanish crisis involving legislative action But as atpresent arranged it includes simplythe consideration of the post office appropriation bill and the Virginia contested election case of Thorp vs Eppeswith the possibility that the naval appropriation bill

Thegood soul seemed to have a constantfear that each time she saw me wouldbe the lastCan you let me have a saw a chiseland a hammer I askedAch yes Bud vhat for NelI am going to find out what is in thatcellar I answeredHow you ged inBy cutting through the floorDat will be hard work Nel De timber under de floor is awf ul thickI know that But I have plenty oftime and so will be able eventually toget throughThe tools were produced and I started homeward Sarah sending after mean earnest appeal for carefulness andthe avoidance of dangerI intended to commence the task ofgetting into the sealed apartment immediately upon my arrival home Thethought that danger of some kindmight lurk in the cellar would not determe And the pistol shot I had heard thelast night seemed to indicate that theremight be a degree of peril in the workI did not like the idea of the dankmusty odors ascending into my sleeping apartment but I could easily remove to one of the spacious chambersupstairs and thus escape themOn arriving at the house I took thetools into my room I looked over thefloor and after quite a time debatingwhere the hole should be made determined to begin over in one corner Before I had time to commence operations a loud knock sounded on thefront doorHastily shoving the tools under thebed I went out through the hall andopened the door My visitor was MrSonntagCHAPTER XI ushered the old lawyer into theroom After a few commonplace remarks he said That walling up ofthose cellar doorways has made quitean impression on me Suppose wehave a look at themI was very willing Together we descended the stairs to the storeroomMr Sonntag examined the placewhere the door had been minutelyas though he expected to find in thestones of the wall some intimation ofwhat was on the inside He even wentso far as to scratch off patches of thewhitewashIt is rather dark here he finallysaid glancing aroundPerhaps the door can be opened IsuggestedI have the key with me but maybeIt would be best not to use it Give mex- few matchesI handed him all I had with me andhe by the light afforded examinedcosely the places where he hadscratched off the whitewashWhile watching him the thoughtagain occurred to me that I had seen ormet him previous to my arrival at NelsonvilleDo you know it seems as though Ihad seen you before I saidYes so you remarked during yourvisit to my office yesterday Sonntagreplied as he stepped back to where Iwas standingThere is no doubt of that being asolid wall he went on so if theroom behind it is being used for somepurpose entrance is not gained fromhere See what pains have been takento hide the work The whole wall hasbeen newly whitewashed If that hadnot been done the new mason workwould be glaringly perceptible Let usgo into the house cellar and have alook at the dividing wall thereIt needed but a glance to see that thiswall had not been tampered with Thewhitewash was old and there was no- spot where it had been renewedI have already examined the outside place the old lawyer remarked-as we ascended the stairway -That was not whitewashed and ifI remember rightly the stones usedlooked old and worn like the rest of thefoundation I saidYes the stones used in both thedoorways were old ones But they aref a different kind of stone he remarked with a shrewd smileDifferent kind What significancethat haveAll the stone quarried about here islimestone You will find the foundations and walls under your house arebuilt with this kind If any other kindwas used it would have to be broughtfrom a distance Sandstone was usedfor the two doorwaysAnd was therefore brought from adistance I askedPerhaps not in this caseBut you said there is nothing butlimestone quarried about here I suggestedAnd that is true The stones usedin the doorways had been used beforefor they are old and weatherbeatenDo you remember a small stone building up at the mountain which yearsago was used as a schoolhouse mylawyer askedOh yes It was known as theMountain school I repliedWell it is fast going to ruincontinued has not been used foryears I am told The point is hereThat old schoolhouse was built ofsandstone Where the builders got thestone I of course cannot say but evidently not around here It is my belief the stones in the two doorwayswere taken from the old tumble downschoolhouseAnd supposing your surmise is acorrect one does it furnish you with aclew to the person or persons who didthe job I askedPerhaps he replied shortlyAs he raised his head to answer recollection flashed upon me Ah Iexclaimed I have been cudgeling mybrain in the endeavor to rememberwhere I had seen you beforeHe quickly turned toward me with ahalf smile on his face but offered noreplyI have seen you in Philadelphia IcontinuedPossibly I used to live there beforecoming to Twineburgh he remarkedindifferentlyYou have been in Twineburgh butsix months I went onYesAnd I saw you for the first timeabout a year ago I almost knocked3ou over as I was coming out of thepresidents office in the Safety securitybank You were just going- in and Iran into youAh possibly I have had businessdealings with that concern the oldlawyer repliedAnd you knew Mr Perry the presidentYes slightlyThen why did you ask me at thetime if I was the president I askedSonntag gave a twitch of the shoulder and his shrewd sharp eyestwinkledDid I ask you that he queriedDo you not rememberCant say that I do herepliedIt seems strange you should leavethe city to engage in the practice oflaw m a small town like TwineburghI said musinglyWhy strange was his curt questionOh well you are quite advanced in3 cars and with your long experienceought to have commanded a larger andmore lucrative practice in a large placelike Philadelphia than in a small country townHe did not reply for a few momentsbut stood with a whimsical look on hisface with his eyes turned toward thefloorI became tired of city life he finallysaid I have no family depending uponme and so am at liberty to follow outany whim which happens to take pos-Ml1Mr Sonntag examined the place minutelysession of me There is enough businesshere to enable a single man to live wellbesides allowing him more leisure Iwas looking for such a business andand found it in TwineburghWell you certainly are an odd fellow if you will excuse me for sayingso I remarked with a laughYes I am rather oddWhen we reentered my bedroomSonntags quick eye caught sight of thetools under my bedGoing to cut through the floor heaskedThat is what I intended to do Imgoing to know what is down there Ireplied decidedlyThen I told him about the noises Ihad heard which had seemed to comefrom beneath the slamming of thedoor and the pistol shot I also toldof the voices I had heard both in theattic and in my room and all I had observed regarding themThe old lawyer listened intently andv hen I had finished walked to the windowDo you suppose that the sound of thevoices could in some way have comefrom the telephone wire I finallyaskedNot being- an electrical expert I cannot say answered turningfrom the windowIt seems impossible the voices couldbe heard without the aid of a receiverI remarkedPerhaps there is a receiver both ihj our room- and upstairs not like theones we are accustomed to of coursebut one formed by nature Certainlythere are possibilities in electric forcewhich we have not yet discovered Yousay the sounds occurred only when awind was blowing which caused thewire to swing- against the lightningrodThat was surmise for I have had noopportunity to watch when the windblew But it seemed the most naturalexplanation of the rappingsAnd you had no way of ascertainingwhether the sounds in your room hereand in the attic were produced by thesame voice and at the same time orwhether there were two voices independent of each otherWhy you know it was impossible forme to be in the attic and in my roomtoo I answeredPerhaps we may be given an opportunity to find out something- about thevoices Sonntag said with a gesture toward the windowHow do you mean I askedThere is a thunderstorm coming upIt will undoubtedly be preceded by awind the old lawyer saidYes yes How fortunate it is thatyou are here I exclaimed excitedlyfor I comprehended his meaningNow you remain here and I will go upto the attic I went on Each of usmust note the exact time the sound isheard We had better compare watchesso that there shall be no difference ineach ones estimate of the timeI pulled out my watch and approachedSonntag His hand went up to his vestpocket and he was about to follow myexample when upon our hearing camethat small soft high pitched voiceWe stood gazing into each otherseyes for a moment then I made a rushfor the doorThe lawyer detained me and in greatimpatience I waitedTake paper and pencil with you hesaid Jot down the words and indicatethe raps in the exact order that theycome I will do the same with thewords and pauses Now goI went up the two stairways on thejump The wind was coming up strongand the heavy thunder rolled in the distance Near the small window whereI had heard the voice I took my standThe raps from above were louder nowand besides in the daytime lost a greatdeal of the uncanniness which thegloom and solitude of night had giventhemThe voice was sounding though notas distinctly as before which was probably on account of the loud moaningand whistling- of the high windM3 paper and pencil were ready andI listened with strained attention tocatch the wordsThis is what my paper showedNever will rap rap rap consentunder existing rap rap a gratingnoise probably caused by the wire being held against the lightning rod bythe force of the wind the property removed raps place to bring you rapshid where raps never find raps talkwisdom I shall raps night and takeraps dollar will you evefRight here the garret was flpodedyjya blinding glare and immediately followed crash on crash close above meStunned by the noise and too dazedfor the moment to realize that thethreatening storm had burst I feeblytottered toward the stairs and sankdown upon the top stepThe rain was coming down in torrents and the roar on the roof seemedbut an echo of the thnnder I was soonable to arouse myself from my dazedcondition and remembering the obiect of mv errand went back to thespot where I had stood to recover thepaper and pencil which had fallenfrom my hands There was no desire tocontinue investigations while the stormlasted so picking- up the paper Ihastened downstairs to my room-I noticed a strange odor as I wentthrough the doorway and saw Sonntagstanding in the middle of the room ina strange attitude The pencil he hadused was still in his hand but the paperhad fluttered to the floorThe old lawyer not seeming to noticemy approach I tapped him on the armHe gazed around at me with wide staring eyes then drew a long- breathWhat was it that happened hefinally askedOh did you catch it too Nothingbut a little demonstration of electricalforce I replied It was quite closeto us The house must have been struckby the bolt or perhaps the lightningrod saved itIt was awful the old fellow exclaimed There was a stream of firereached half way across the room Itcame from the wall there right nearthe chimney Well its over and-neitherof us hurt The old fellow shookhimself together After this no moreexperimenting- in electricity for me especially duringl a thunderstorm Illstick to to the law he said with aflash of his bright eyes which told mehe had recovered from the effects ofthe shockThen you did not take any note ofthe voice I remarkedYes yes Here

largelumber of rapid fire guns for seacoastlefenses This action is taken without waiting for the allotment amonghe various bureaus of the war andaavy departments of the 50000000roted for the national defense Thesecretary felt that there was noreason for further delaying the necessary steps for the procurementDf these guns as it was feltihere would be no trouble in arrivingit an equitable adjustment of the money available Ever since the battleship Maine was wrecked in HavanaHarbor the ordnance department hasbeen hastening the delivery of gunsalready finished and making arrangements for the supply of such a numberof additional ones as the officials feltwarranted in ordering without the additional funds which have since beenput at their disposal The ordnancebureau will take all these rapid fireEfuns that can be procured within a reasonable time and they will be shippedto the seacoast fortifications as rapidly as possible They constitutewhat is known as the auxiliary defensefor the fortifications and are a material assistance to the big guns whichnecessarily are slower of movementand firing They also would be of invaluable assistance in keeping the enemys ships from the vicinity of submarine mines and other obscux edworks of defense by maintaining aconstant fire over such places Contracts for the delivery of carriages forthese rapid fire guns have also beenauthorized and will be shipped to thefortifications as soon as completedThe carriages can be made anddelivered much quicker than theguns so that expedition in the manufacture of the latter is what theofficials of the ordnance bureau areurging Quite a number of establishments throughout the United Stateshave responded to the departmentsinquiries as to whether they can assistin making these guns They includethe Army gun factory the Bethlehemiron works the Driggs Ordnance Coand the American Ordnance Co Theguns are mounted without much trouble so that haste in their manufactureis the essential in the present crisisIt is now admitted by theordnance officials that directionshave been given to the variousarsenals and armories controlled bythe government to increase the working force to the fullest practical extent with a view to hurrying the completion of existing projects Likewiseall firms having contracts to supplythe government with ordnance havebeen requested to work their men nightand day in order

for fruit this seasonPubs The Bourbon NewsComplying with your request towrite something abont the fruit prospect of 98 for The Bourbon News itgoes without saying that to this datenothing is injured and every chance themodt favoring Last Fall was very dryand as always under these circumstances every fruit and forest tree willbloom profusely giving the initial condition of full yieldThe apple is the great staple fruit ofthe rarm ana as we nave naa no cropsince 95 there is now no reason whythe phenomenal yield of that year maynot be repeated this The stone fiuitsbear full year after year but of courseafter failure or scant crop the capabilitity of the trees is increasedIf the present prospect be not blightedby untimely frost or cold rains at thetime of blooming we may expectabundance and fine quality in peachesplums and cherriesLast Fall especially favorrd thegtape and of these we are comparatively certainThe use of small fruits has woud rfully increased in Kentucky anri fewcountry homes but have straw b rriesraspberries blackberries currants andgooseberries Now the prospect forthese is not good The blossom of thestrawberry is formed in the Fall and athing conceived and nurtured in poverty and distress has not the inherentvigor of that born of favoring conditions These plants all showed distressunder the glinting heat and draught oflast Fall and it was perfectly evidentthen that save uuder the most fosteringSpring conditions the berry crop of 98would not be as that of 97The opinion is confidently venturedthat the coming year will becornucopian in the larger fruits anddisappointing in the smaller onesPresent weather conditions do notfavor and the fruit crop of 1894 was atotal loss by reason of the severe frostsbeginning on March 25th after threeweeks ot charming weather just as thisShould present weather long continuemany elements of danger are addedaffecting fruits both large and smallIn the Spring of 1869 peach tiees werein full bloom about March 20th and thecrop that year was exceptionally finebut an early Spring is rarely advantageous to the fruit crop of KentuckyH F HillenmeyerWe are the peoples friends We repair your linen and put neck bands onfree

fair to seeAnd in a measure it Is dear to meBut oh the dear old timesNow when winds wail and snow is fallingfastAs at no other time from out the pastyouth rings sweet memory chimesI see the brown old house upon the hillThe coasting- hill so smooth and white themillWhere father earned our breadAgain I haste from school at close of dayWith empty pail along the snowy wayIn cap and mittens redAnd when at length in weary hungryplightI reached my mothers kitchen warm andbrightA senge of peace and restFilled all my boyish being for I knewThe best of all love mother love so trueMade that place rich and blestI see the table set with homely careNo costly service nor attendance thereBut oh my mothers foodAnd fathers face across the bounteousboardWho always on our food Gods grace imploredBeamed gently kind and goodThen came the happy hours I loved thebestWhen weary father took his well earnedrestAnd mother too as wellSometimes the blue eyed girl across thewayCame in and joined in homely treat or playWorking her binding spellWhich held me even then through childhoods daysAnd holds me still while walking manhoods waysAnd so it always willOh time of dawning love of joy and mirthIn mothers kitchen round the dear oldhearthI seem to live there stillI almost taste the tempting nuts so brownAnd corn so snowy white and light asdownAnd apples crisp and redThen came a blessed time wherein I traceThe soft sweet outline of my mothers faceAbove my dream strewn bedFiercer yet fiercer rage the wailing windsThe snow beats ceaselessly against theblindsAh how the picture glowsAnd can it be that

evening- andas she seemed disinclined to ventureout I offered to go for them We wereall alone in the house for father andmother had gone to the country fora few days and Tom of course wasaway at the ofiiceWhen I opened the door to go out Ifound Ah Sin our Chinese washerman standing on the door mat Hecould speak no English so I did notwaste any words on him but just motioned him to go upstairs he wouldfind Nellie there I thought and shecould give him the clothes I did notwant the bother of going back I didnot call out to tell Nellie he was goingup I did not think it necessary1 must have been gone about threequarters of an hour for the little dairywhere we got the fresh eggs was fourlong blocks away and I stayed awhiletalking to the young girl who waitedon me It was getting dusk when Ireached our door and I remember being surprised when I looked up at thetransom to see that the hall lamp wasunlighted Nellie had such a horror ofdarkness I was even more surprisedwhen I opened the door to see Ah Sindisappear down the passage and enterthe kitchen the kitchen dining roomand Toms room are the only roomson the first floor Did I only imagineit or was there something furtive inthe Mongolians movementsBah how fanciful I am getting Ithought Nellie has told him to go iiithere to get the soiled kitchen towelsI lighted the hall lamp left the eggson the table and ran up the stairsWhen I reached the landing I sawsomething which made me so faint thatI had to lean against the banister forsupportSo that 3ou will quite understand theposition in which I found myself I will Jdescribe our upper hall and the situation of the rooms oppositethe landing- was a window overlookingthe back yard the bedroom Nellie andI occupied together was on the leftside the door opening near the headof the stairs mothers room and theXiJirlor -were in the front a passageleading to them from the head of thestairs The hall was floored with whitemarble a curious fancy of my fathersIn front of each door was a thickwoolly red mat Now all the roomswere closed and trickling from undertlie doors of our room was a thin redstream which formed a great pool andwhich though it had seemed so darkdownstairs was here qurte discerniblein the half light which came from thehall windowIn a Hash I saw it all The Chinamanhad killed my sister it was her lifeWood which trickled from the door andlay in that ghastly pool on the whitemarble I gathered my skirts to stepover it and enter our room and verifyiny awful fears when I heard astealthy muffled footfall on the stairsIn the horror of my discovery I hadforgotten that the Chinaman was stilliii the house In a moment he wouldle upon me and I would share theterrible fate of my sister who mustibe dead for who could lose all thatIblood and live Being sure then thatsshe was beyond my aid I felt that Imust try if possible to save my ownr But how Outside of the hallwindow was a wide stone shelf on whichwe keptpot plants near it was a stanrtionary ladder which the workmen usedto ascend when the roof needed repairingI sprang lightly over the horriblepool ran noiselessly across the halland was on the window sill gettingout when the Mongolians head appeared above the stairs He saw meuttered an inarticulate guttural soundand swiftly followed me I made aspring reached the ladder and climbedto the roof I would not descend tothe yard the chances of escape wereless that way for the wooden fenceround the yard was very high andas the houses on either side were unoccupied it would be quite possible forme to be murdered without any neighbors hearing my cries If once I couldreach the flat roof of our house Ithought I would be safe for the roofsof the houses in our block were aswell known to me as the street Iwas something of a tomboy and onevenings when the cats made the nightair hideous with their concerts Tomand I used often to go on the roofs andhunt them sometimes chasing themthe whole block he clad in his pajamasand I in my cycling suitIt was therefore an easy matter forme to climb the ladder but just as Ihad crossed the roof and was aboutto drop myself on the next which waslower than ours the dreaded celestialhead again appeared this time justabove the last rung of the ladder Ohif only I had the power to hurl himdown before he reached the roof Itore at the bricks in the chimney butnot one would loosen There was nothing to be done but to run and to screamin the hope of attracting the attentionof some passer by on the street below but when I opened my mouth tocry out no sound would come from myparched throat My gymnastic training-stood me in good stead Iran dropped to the lower roofsclimbed to the higher ones withthe agility of a monkey But still Iwould have had no advantage over mypursuer had it not been for my superiorknowledge of the roofs The Chinamanfollowed me swiftly Though I darednot look back I could hear his quickbreathing not far behindWhen we got near the end of theblock I dodged my pursuer and doubledon my tracks Eor a moment he seemedpuzzled I seized the opportunityslipped quickly behind him grasped hispigtail jerked him backward he losthis balance and fell on his back ThenI ran to the edge of the roof overlooking the street and screamed to my surprise my voice had come back and myscream was heard by a man passing onthe opposite side of the street Hestopped and looked around bewilderedI screamed again and guided by thesound he looked up and saw me themoon was just rising behind the houseand my form was clearly outlinedagainst the light the moon threw beforeit But my shouting had also shown theChinaman my whereabouts he had recoverd himself and was again after meI could hear his quick animal pantingjust behind me I ran on he followingbut hope now gave added speed to mysteps help would soon be mine fora crowd had gathered on the streetand seemed clearly to realize my danger Men ran to and fro or eagerly consulted together and presently a number of workmen came along dragging afiremans ladder This they placedagainst one of the houses menswarmed up like flies and in less timethan it takes me to tell it the Chinaman-was secured strangely enough hemade no resistance and did not appearto be armed and we were both takendownWhen the crowd heard what the Mongolian had done they declared theywould lynch him then and there Theytore him from the policeman who hadhim in charge dragged him to the nearest tree which was not far for ourstreet was planted with trees a ropewas brought from somewhere and despite the wretched mans pleadings inimpassioned Chinese for mercy wasslipped around the branches At thatmoment a broad shouldered man brokethrough the crowd and demanded thecause of the uproar It was Tom Themob paused to explain I ran to naybrother clung to his arm and betweenmy incoherent words and their explanations he at last gathered the meaning we wished to convey but still helooked puzzledNellie Did I understand you to sayDora that it was Nellie this man murderedYesWhy I have come straight from thehouse and Nellie was there as well asshe ever was in her life only anxiousat your long absence and curious toknow the cause of the disturbance inthe streetThere must be some mistake I answered I saw her blood streamingfrom under our bedroom door Perhaps it was her spirit you sawA pretty substantial spirit then Imust say and one that can enjoy mutton chops and fresh eggs as well as amortal Come right along boys turning to the crowd and see for yourselves that my sister is all right ComeDoraHe drew my arm within his own andturned toward home themiob following with the Chinaman the rope stillaround his neck When we reachedour house there was Nellie safe andsound standing on the steps Beforewe could say a word she cried outWhat are they doing to Ah Sin Ohwhat a shame to treat a poor Chinamanso and impulsively she ran downand while the Mongolian made volubleexplanation pulled the rope from hisneckSpeak a little slower Ah Sin then Ishall be able to follow you nicely saidNellie kindly I forgot to tell you thatNeilie can speak Chinese she used toteach in the Chinese mission schoolWhat does he say I asked AndTell us what the heathen is saringyoung lady cried the menNellie asked the Chinaman a fewquestions which he answered withTHE BOURBON NEWS4 TUESDAY MARCH 15 1898much gesticulation for he was moreexcited than I have seen a Chinamaneither before or since as well he mightbe then she turned to usI think I can explain Ah Sins partin this adventure When he broughtthe clothes this afternoon I found some-were missing I sent him back to getthem telling him I would not pay forthe washing until he brought everything He went away and came backwith the missing clothes in about halfan hour I then paid him and sent himdown to the kitchen for some things forthe wash I had left there He got themand was about to go out when he remembered that he had not asked mewhen he was to call again Just as hereached the head of the stairs he sawDora getting out of the -window jumpedto the conclusion that she was a thiefand followed her I must tell youaddressing the crowd that he does notknow Dora she is usually away atwork when he comes for the clothesIt just happened that she got oflearly to day and he saw her for thefirst time this afternoon when she lethim in so his mistake was not an unnatural one He did not dream that ayoung lady of the house would do sucha thing as climb out of a windowthough if he knew Dora he would notbe in the least surprised Here Nellielaughed That is Ah Sins story andit seems to me a reasonable one Ofcourse when he followed Dora shethought he meant to kill her but Icannot undersand what she wanted onthe roof at that hour What was itDoraThen I explained telling her aboutthe pool of blood which I was now beginning to think existed only in my imaginationOh that and an annoyed perturbed expression crossed her faceYou recollect the quart bottle of redink father brought home the evening before he went to the country andwhich Tom was to take down to theoffice He forgot it every day and y o 11Dora took it into our room the day youneeded some you carelessly left it nearthe door and when I went in to get themoney for Ah Sin I must have knockedit over with my skirt I did not notice itat the time but when I went into ourroom later on I found the bottle lyingon its side the cork out and that greatpool in the hall Oh again directlyaddressing the crowd if there is anyone here who can tell how to get redink stains out of white marble I shall beso grateful My father will be crazy ifhe comes back and finds the hall floorstainedA janitor of one of the large citybuildings came forward and the twoheld a conversation When I thoughtthey had talked long enough I interrupted them to ask NellieHow was it you did not hear mewhen I came upstairsI was in the front parlor readingWhen Ah Sin left me I did not hear asound until Tom came homeWell I guess everything is clearnow remarked Tom There is nothing to be done but thank these gentlemen for their promptitude in comingto Doras assistance arid to soothe theChinamans wounded feelingsWith that he slipped something intoAh Sins hand which made the Celestialsmile Then Nellie and I handed in ourlittle contributions and Ah Sin and myrescuers departedBut unfortunately that was by nomeans the end of it I had to face theridicule of my

of manufacturing it bya freezing instead of a heating process as carried out at Cattaraugas NY is important and interesting Thefirst treatment consists in placing themilk in a vacuum chamber to rid it ofanimal gases and atmospheric air dissolved in the milk which appears atthe surface in bubbles and thus escapes This reduces the volume of the -milkabout one tenth The milk leavesthis chamber at the proper temperature for the removal of the fatty contents by means of a cream separatorwhich is set to run heavy cream During this process any foreign mattersuch as solid particles which are always in evidence are removed and thecream is added subsequently to the finished productFrom the separator the fat free milkis run over a bank of copper pipesthrough which ice water circulates reducing the temperature of the milkfrom 80 degrees After passing overthese cooling coils it is placed in refrigerating chambers and constantlystirred In about nine hours the wholebulk of milk is converted into a massof icy crystals and milk sufficientlythick to form into hummocks This isagain placed in a centrifugal andthe milk reduced in volume about onehalf An average sample of the icewhich looks very much like snow giveson analysis only about two tenths ofone per cent of solid matter Thenew thick milk is returned to the freezing closet and in about seven hoursmore it is reduced to a dense mass ofcrystals which after centrifugaltreatment measures only one quarterof the original bulk A third freezingof 4 hours and a centrifugal extraction reduces the bulk of the milk toabout 13 per cent of its original volumeThe final step of the process is the ad-mixture of the heavy cream in proportion to the fat free milk This finalproduct or condensed milk is a fairrepresentation of milk minus the bulkjof its water Moreover it is free from 1foreign flavors and has an aroma whichis true to the milk from which it iaprepared It mixes readily with waterforming milk from which cream willseparate as from untreated milk Toshow the great concentration of themilk it may be stated that taking 10Ogallons of milk as a unit quantity thiswould reduce to 13 gallons in the endIn other words the 87 gallons of water1In the milk are formed into ice leav -ing an unfrozen balance of very thickmilk which represents milk sugarcasein and inorganic salts fully ninefgallons of solids The fat equivalentadded by the heavy cream removed injthe first operation is adjusted in thefinal treatment to represent a dilution with water three parts and condensed milk one part a proportion ofthree and sixteenths per cent of milkfat which is the normal proportion inthe average milk It is stated thatcondensed milk prepared in this manner will keep indefinitely as the micro-organismsproducing fermentationare destroyed Philadelphia RecordNegroes and CottonThe negroes of the south had the bestof training in varied fields of labor under skillful and intelligent managersIn those regions where a diversity ofcrops was planted they became expertfarmers It is a gross error into whichmany of our northern friends havefallen in thinking that the negroes axepoor laborers They may be wantingin skill but it is to be doubted whetherany other laboring population on earthever produced results from agricultureso large so constant so magnificentand so remunerative And this is trueof the negroes in the south to dayWhen we reflect that upon their laborin the cotton fields- millions of operatives in the old world are absolutely dependent for employment andance their value as laborers becomes atonce apparent and

Afflicted witli ItOne of the causes of dysentery as thewinter bee disease is usually termed isdisturbing them in cold weather Infact it is often the case that disturbingthem in very cold weather is the mostdisastrous thing that could be doneas it causes dysentery to appear amongthe bees in its worst form For thisreason no one should be allowed to goamong the hives in very cold weatherany more than is strictly necessary toproperly look after them Xor shouldstock be allowed to run among themduring the winter for fear of disturbingtbemThe disease may also appear whenthe bees are closely confined for a longtime or when they are compelled to liveupon impure honey Many good beekeepers claim that honey from cidermills decayed fruit and honey dew isnot healthy foodIf the winter is an open one so thatthe bees can fly out often they will liveon this kind of honey without injuryBut if the weather is so cold and stormythat the bees are kept closely confinedthe poor food tells and dysentery is tilmost certain to make its appearanceamong them and a colony badly afflicted will often be hard to cureOne of the best things that can bedone in fact about the only thing thatwill be of any benefit is to give thema purifying flight Let them have achance for a flight the first bright warmday that comesFeeding candy is to some extentbeneficial But the best and safectplan is to prevent Give
