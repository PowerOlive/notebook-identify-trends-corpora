Colonel Asa K. Martin, widely
"known weather prognosticator of
Central Kentucky, for years a resi
dent of Lexington, but who is now
- making his home with his daughter
in Louisville, makes the prediction
iat the coming winter in Kentucky
would be one of the severest since
the cold winter of 1888-'89.
He says in his prognostication
that there will be twenty-one snows,
tie first falling on October 13, and
the last on May 2, 1922. During
the winter he says there will b
aerenteen zero days and three ice
spells, when ice from three to
twelve inches thick will be harvest
ed. He also makes provision for
tferee sleet storms. The first frost
jfe this latitude he says is due to
arrire 5n September 10.
Colonel Martin says the severe
winter ahead will cause much suf
fering throughout the country, and
warns the public to "take time
Tftr the fore top" and prepare id ad
mnce for it. Colonel Martin has

The publication date on Jamps
Oliver Curwood's new noyel titled
"The Flaming Forest" was advanc
ed from August 24 to August 10, J
according to an announcement just
made by nis publisher. '
This story, by the author, whose
last two novels sold well over a hun
dred thousand copies each, is the
third of his trilogy of tales of the
Three-River Country, and wholesale
book dealers have reported so many
advanced orders for the book that
its -first edition of more than a hun
dred thousand copies enough books
to reach twelve miles, end to end
is already practically subscribed for.
The previous two stories of Cur
wood's trilogy were "The Rivers
End" and MThe Vally of Silent
Men," and each was listed as one of
the best sellers for nearly a year.
They were stories tense with ad
venture, mystery, romance and the
glamour of the North Woods, a re
gion, incidentally, of which Cur
wood has a great deal of first-hand
knowledge, having spent much of his
time on extended hunting trips in
British Columbia and among the na
tives of the Canadian Northwest.
