steamer of the 10th for homethe officials are not discouragedat the outlook knowing that thedelay in the proceedings of thecommission admits of a reasonableexplanation at some points Forinstance there has been some difficulty in reaching an agreement as tothe disposition of the public propertyin the Philippines including war material guns and stores It seems however likely now that the commissionerswill agree to adopt a plan for the disposition of these claims based upon theprocedure that governed in the case ofthe Spanish properties in Porto RicoIt will not be necessary it is hoped tosend a joint evacuation commission toManila as was done in the evacuationof Porto Rico but simply to adopt theplan laid down by the Porto RicancommissionParis Dec 5 The United Statesand Spanish

CourtThat calls to mind a queer experience ofwho had listened tomy own said a lawyerthe story Some years ago I defended afellow for murder in a little southern townand the worst witness we had against us wasan old German who was a stackbuilder bytrade A stack by the way is merely anotherThe old fellow wasname for a big chimneyperfectly honest and gave his evidence insuch a clear straightforward manner that 1felt my client was doomed unless I couldthink of some way to break him down WhileI was cudgeling my brains a friend whisperedto me to ask him how high he could build astack What do you mean I asked in surprise Never mind said my friend justslip in that question and see So at the tailend of the cross examination I paused asif struck by an afterthought and said Youare a stackbuilder I believe Yes sir re-plied the witness Well sir I continuedrabout how high could you build I nevergot any further A swift inscrutable changeflashed over the Germans face and he roseexcitedly from his chair As high as dersky he roared So high dose angels comearound it like birds In five seconds he wasraving You see the man was a monomaniac sane on every subject but one andmy friend happened to know his weak spotIt is hardly necessary to say that his evidence in regard to the homicide was prompt-ly ruled out by the judge and as there was noother witness of importance my man wascleared The rascal should have been hangedand would have been but for the lucky reference to the stack N 0 Times-DemocratExpert and Able to Speak IntelligentlyExpert Stephen Little who has just returned from an extended

always appropriate is this yearof primary importance in view of the momeutoub issues which have arisen demanding inone instance the ultimate determination byarms and involving far reaching consequencesivhich will require the earnest attention of thecongressIn my last annual message very full consideration was given to the question of the dutyof the government of the United States towardSpain and the Cuban insurrection as being byfar the most important problem with whichvc were then called upon to deal The considerations ad vanccd and the exposition of theviews therein expressed disclosed my sense ofthe gravity of the situation Setting aside aslogically unfounded or practically inadmissible the recognition of the Cuban insurgents asbelligerents the recognition of the independence of Cuba neutral intervention to end thewar by imposing a rational compromise between the contestants intervention in favorof one or the other party and forcible annexation of the island I concluded it was honestly due to our friendly relations with Spainthat she should be given a reasonable chancetofealize her expectations of reform to whichshe had become irrevocably committed Within a few weeks previously she had announcedcomprehensive plans which it was confidentlyasserted Avould be cmcucious to remedy theevils so deeply our own country soinjurious to the true inteicsts of the mothercountry as well as to those or Cuba und so repugnant to the universal sentiment of humanityThe ensuing month brought little sign of realprogress toward the pacification of Cuba Theautonomous administrations set up in the capital and some of the principal cities appearednot to gain the favor of the inhabitants nor tobe able to extend their influence to the largeextent of territory held by the insurgentswhile the military arm obviously unable tocope with still active rebellion continued many of the most objectionable and offensive policies ofthe government that had preceded it Notangible relief was afforded the vastof unhappy rcconcentrados despite tue reiterated professions made in that regard and theamount appropropriated by Spain to that endThe proffered expedient of zones of cultivation proved illusory indeed no less practicalnor more delusive promises of succor couldwell have been tendered to the exhausted anddestitute people stripped of all that made lifeand home dear and herded in a strange regionamong unsympathetic strangers hardly lessnecesitous than themselvesBy the endof Dacember the mortality amongthem had frightfully increased Conservativeestimates from Spanish sources placed thedeaths among thee distressed people at over40 per cent from the time Gen Weylcrs decree of reconcentration was enforeed Withthe acqiescence of the Spanish authorities ascheme was adopted for relieT by charitablecontributions raised in this country and distributed under the direction of the consulgeneral and the several consuls by noble andearnest individual effort through the organizedagencies of the American Red Cross Thousands of lives Avere thus saved but manythousands more were inaccessible to suchforms of aidThe Avar continued

present insurrection from its start No alternative savephysical exhaustion of either combatant andtherewithal the practic il ruin of the islandlay in sight but how far distant no one couldventure to conjectureTHE DESTRUCTION OF THE MAINEAt this juncture on the 15th of Februarylast occurred the destruction of the battleship Maine Avhile rightfully lying in the harbor of Havana on a mission of internationalcourtesy and good will a catastrophe the suspicious nature and horror of which stirred thenations heart profoundly It is a strikingevidence of the poise and sturdy good sensedistinguishing our national character that thisshocking blow falling upon a generous peoplealready deeply touched by pieceding events inCuba did not move them to an instant desperate resolve to tolerate no longer the existence of a condition of danger and disorder atour doors that made possible such a deed bywhomsoever Avrought Yet the instinct of justice prevailed and the nation anxiously awaited the result of the searching investigation atonce set on foot The finding of the navalboard of inquiry established that the origin ofthe explosion Avas external by a submarinemine and only halted through lack cf positivetestimony to fix the responsibility of its authorshipAll these things carried conviction to themost thoughtful even before the finding of thenaval court that a crisis in our relations withSpain and toward Cuba Avas at hand Sostrong Avas this belief that it needed but a briefexecutive suggestion to the congress to receiveimmediate answer to the duty of making instant provision for the possible and perhapsspeedily probable emergency of war and theremarkable almost unique spectacle Avas presented of a unanimous vote of both houses onthe 9th of March appropriating

sudden attack fromthe navy of Spain Avhich comprised modernvessels of the highest type of constructiontalperfection Our army also required enlargement of men and munitions It is sufficient tosay that the outbreak of Avar when it didcome found our nation not unprepared tomeet the conflictNor Avas the apprehension of coming strifeconfined to our OAvn country It Avas felt bythe continental poAvers

negotiations Avould lead to anagreement Avhich Avhile securing the maintenance of peace Avould afford all necessaryguarantees for the re establishment oforder in Cuba In responding to thatrepresentation I said I shared thehope the envoys had expressed thatpeace might be preserved in a manner to terminate the chronic condition of disturbancesin Cuba so injurious and menacing to our interests and tranquility as Avell as shocking toour sentiments of humanityNEGOTIATIONS AVITH SPAINStill animated by the hope of a peaceful solution and obeying the dictates of duty no effort Avas relaxed to bring about a speedy ending of the Cuban struggle Negotiations tothis object continued actively Avith the government of Spain looking to the immediateconclusion of a six months armistice in CubaAvith a view to effect the recognitionof her peoples right to independence Besides this the instantrevocation of the order of reconcentration Avas asked so that the sufferers returning to their homes and aided by United American and Spanish effort might be put in a Avayto support themselves and by orderly resumption of the Avell nigh destroyed productive energies of the island contribute to therestoration of its tranquility and Avell beingNegotiations continued for some little time atMadrid resulting in offers by the Spanishgovernment Avhich could not but be regardedas inadequateGrieved and disappointed at this barren outcome of my sincere endeavors to reach a practicable solution I felt it my duty to remit theAvhole question to congress and did so in mymessage of April 11 1898In view of all this the congress Avas asked toauthorize and empower the president to takemeasures to secure a full and final terminationof hostilities betAveen Spain and the people ofCuba and to secure in the island the establishment of a stable goAcrnment capableorder and observing its internationalobligations insuring peace and tranquilityand the security of its citizens as Avell as ourown and for

Avhichthe energy of our citizens and the necessity ofour staple productions for Chinese uses hasbuilt up in those regions may not be prejudiced through any exclusive treatment by theneAv occupants has obviated the need of ourcountry becoming an actor in the sceneOur position among nations Having a largePacific coast and a constantly expanding direct trado Avith the farther Orient giAesustheequi

the HaAvaiianislands should reeeiAe new exeqaters from thisgOAsrnmentThe attention of congress is called to the factthat our consular offices having ceased to existin HaAvaii and being about to cease in othercountries coming under the soAereignty of theUnited States the provisions for the relief andtransportation of destitute American seamenin those countries under our consular regulations will in consequence terminate It isproper therefore that neAv legislation shouldbe enacted upon this subject in order to meetthe changed conditionsThe message recommends some amendmentsto our extradition

a conference of representatives of thetreasury departments of the United States andMexico to consider the subject of concurrentlegislation of the tAvo countries looking to theprotection of the revenues by harmoniousmeasures operating legally on either side ofthe boundaryOUR RELATIONS AVITH PERUThe goAcrnment of Peru has giAen the prescribed notification of its intention to abrogatethe treaty of friendship commerce and navigation concluded Avith this country August 311887 As that treaty contains many importantprovisions necessary to the maintenance ofcommerce and good relations Avhich couldAvith difficulty be replaced by the nominationof reneAved provisions within the brief twelvemonths intervening before the treaty terminates I have invited suggestions by Peru rsto the particular provisions it is desired to annul in the hope of reaching an arrangementwhereby the remaining articles may be proAisionally savedTHE CZARS PEACE PROPOSALThe president calls attention to the proposalof the czar of Russia to reduce the military establishments of the different nations and expresses the hope that the contemplated conference will accomplish such a desirable reformOTHER FOREIGN MATTERSr The claims of OAvners of American sealingvessels for seizure by Russian cruisers in Behrlng sea arc being pressed to a settlement Theequity of the cases justifies the expectation thata measure of reparation Avill eventually be accorded in harmony Avith precedent and in thelight of proven factsImmediately upon the outbreak of the Avarwith Spain the Swiss government proposed tothe United States and Spain that they shouldseverally recognize and carry into executionas a modus Vivendi during the continuance ofhostilities the additional articles proposed tothe International Red Cross conference ofGeneA a October 20 1858 extending the effectsof the existing Red Cross convetion of 1864to the conduct cf naval war The SavIss proposal was promptly and cordially accepted byus

especially charged to press our claimsfor indemnity by reason of the destruction orthe property -of American missionaries resident in that country during the Armeniantroubles of 1895 as well as for the recognitioaof older claims of equal justnessTHE ISSUING OF COMMERCIAL REPORTSDuring the past year the important Avork ofcollecting information of practical benefit toAmerican industries and trade through thoagency of the diplomatic and consular officershas been steadily advanced and in order to laysuch data before the public with theleast delay the practice was begun in January1898 of issuing the commercial reports fronrday to day as they are received by the department of state It is believed that forpromptitude as Avell as fullness or information the service thus supplied to our merchantsand manufacturers will be found to show sensible improvement and to merit the liberalsupport of congressSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY REPORTThe secretary of the treasury reports thatthe receipts of the government from all sourcesduring the fiscal year ended June 30 1893 in-eluding 584751223 received from sale of Pacific-railroadsamounted to 5405321335 and itsexpenditures to 443368582 There

presented for redemption in gold and areredeemed in gold such notes shall be kept andset apart and only paid out in exchange forgold This is an obvious duty If the holderof the United States note prefers the gold andgets it from the government he shouldnot reeeiAe back from the gOAernment a United States notepaying gold in exchange for it There son forthis is made all the more apparent Avhen thegovernment issues an interest bearing debt toprovide gold for the redemption of UnitedStates notes a non interest bearing debtSurely it should not pay them out again except on demand and for gold

of Lincolns ShootingA highly interesting story is told toaccount for the fact that almost everywooden clock in America has its handspainted to indicate the hour of 18 minutes past 8 It is related that most suchwatchmakers signs were originallymade by one man who was at first inthe habit of painting the hands to indicate any old or young hour that struckhis fancy when he came to that part ofthe job But when President Lincolnwas assassinated he conceived the ideaof commemorating the event by recording the hour and minute thereof uponall his wooden timepieces a customever since perpetuated There is something striking and dramatio about thisnotion of time standing still foreverafter an event of such tragic significance There is no doubt about the factthat nearly all the wooden clocks do indicate the hour of 18 minutes past 8You can see that for yourself But if theclockmaker thought he was thereby recording the hour of the assassinationhis intelligence was as wooden as hiswares for President Lincoln was shotnot at 18 minutes past 8 but at about15 minutes past 10 New York PostA Timely EventThe bell at the parsonage wentand as the dominie was in hisstudy and his wife getting the

which marked the graves ofthose who fought and died there Itwas autumn now and as I well andstrong again walked down the longavenue of beeches that led to the parkgates of Bidache I let my memory runback to the days in the hospital of SteGenevievewhither I was borne from thefield and above all to the tall slightblack robed figure that came to see medailjT and for whose coming I used tolong with an infinite desire Who orwhat she wTas I cared not and recklessy abandoned myself to the feelingsthat were aroused in my heart I shallnot forget what happened one afternoon A long gallery in the convent ofSte Genevieve had been turned into award and here the wounded lay on pallets with a walking space between Owing to madames kindness I was comfortably quartered at the end of the gallery and a screen had been set betweenme and the other patients I was gaining strength daily and at the momentI speak of was in a state between sleeping and waking when I hetird a laughand the sound of footsteps and sawthrough the partly open wing of thescreen that my lady had come to makeher daily rounds not attended as usualonly by her women but by a gaylydressed cavalier as well and ii was hislaugh that I had heard In thin persondressed in the extreme of fashion Imade out M dAyen the same whohad so kindly suggested that I shouldbe left to die on the field He batteredalong holding a kerchief edged withgoldagainlace to his nose and ever andwaving it in the air whilst hespoke in a loud tone regardless of thelooks cast at him by the sisters in attendance on the wounded They cameslowly toward me for madame stayedconstant to speak to some maimedwretch and I saw her slip money intothe hand of some and there were kindwords for all I felt a strange pleasurein watching her whilst at the sametime I thought of my past and how unfit I was even to nurse such a dream asmy love for her When within a yard orso of the screen madame bent over asufferer and dAyen exclaimed in hisbiting voiceMorbleu Madame But you are thePrincess of Charity Let us hasten toyour interesting patient however Hismajesty is most anxious to hear ofhimHis majesty has never done me thehonor to

youand begs me to add that he is of a temper that can brook no rival in war orlove Let me on my own accountthat it would be well if M le Chevalierwould take a change of airI looked from one to another

meeting atried friend Later on Jacques informed me that after the rout he hadmade the best of his way back to the oldrock and stayed there hoping for newsof me At last it came with orders forhim to hurr3r to Bidache and he did sobearing- with him such things as hethought T needed as well as a hundredpistoles of rents As for the sword ithad been given to him on his arrival bymadames orders to
