EPISCOPAL CHUBCH NEEDS
MOEE MINISTERS -
The Episcopal church in the Unit
ed States faces a real problem
through the steady decrease in the
number of recruits for the minis
try, a commission appointed to in
vestigate the subject, declared a re
port made public recently. This sit
uation, the commission stated, "is
more grave than seems to be the
case with other religious bodies."
In the dioc6se of New York where
4n the fifties there was one min
ister for every 491 communicants,
the commission found that to-day
there was only one minister for
every 2,523'. This proportion is
maintained throughout the country,
the commission reported, adding:
"The seriousness of our case is
heightened by the interplay of two
facts; that our membership is in
creasing more rapidly than the aver
age, while at the same time our
ministry is increasing much less
rapidly than the average. It means
that we are pressing more quickJy
toward the critical moment when
there will be so few ministers that
our -whole growth and work will-be
menaced."
