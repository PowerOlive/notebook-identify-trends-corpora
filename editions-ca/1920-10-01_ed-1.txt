Notonly that it will .become a Statein which "the servants have becomethe masters, for the negro womenintend to register and to vote. True,the soft pedal is being put on thatfact by the "Republican politiciansbut it is a fact neverthless that themost complete and systematic plansfor the regisration and voting ofthe entire adult negro population ofKentucky have been made by theprofessional politicians who usednegro vote of Kentucky to suchgood effect last fall.The questions naturally arisesJiave the white women of Kentuckyless conception of public duty, lessresponsibility to their new citizenship, than the negro servants? Ifthat questions is answered in afiirpnative U means that a terrible mistake was made in giving women theright of suffrage. Somehow, we donot feel it even possible that Kentucky's fine white women can for aminute shirk the duty citizenshipbrings to them. Somehow we feelthat when registration day comesno white woman will have to beurged or coaxed to go and registeror when November 2 comes will shehave to be coaxed to go and vote.There are some things that no Southern State will stand and one of thesejs domination by the negio race.Louisville, according toj a formerchief of police of that city. Col. J.H. Haager, is already suffering fromthe political alliance between theRepublican party and the criminalnegro.Ex-Chief Haager told the womenof Louisville at a public meetingthat the negroes who belonged to thesporting element were being coddledby the city administration and allowed to loaf and gamble to thenheart's content.o-"UNCLE BILL" LIGHTS IN NEWSPAPERDOM AGAINVerily "Uncle Bill" Schooler,versatile newspaper man, must bepossessed by a wanderlust.

THE NEWS man wasan eye-witness in all three cases,and can personally testify to an astonishing recklessness displayed byall the drivers.A big truck belonging to a Parismercantile firm and a machine driven by a Bourbon county womancollided near the corner of Tenthand Pleasant streets. Both weregoing at a high rate of speed. Thetruck came up Pleasant street, thewoman's machine from Tenth street.Not a honk from either betrayedtheir presence. Woman's machinesustained broken fender. Truckuninjured. Pure thoughtlessness.Two big touring cars, one goingup High street, the other comingout Seventh street, almost met at thecorner of High and Seventh. Onlyfour inches of space between whenthey stopped. Neither sounded theirauto horns. Both going unusuallyhigh speed. Both drivers used profanity, but used poor judgment inracing corners. No damage done.Two machines, one driven by anexpert driver, a man who has beenin the auto business for years, theother engineered by an amateur, metnot by any prearranged plan, nearFourth and Main, Wednesday afternoon. Both plunging aicng ax ahigh-rate of speed. Neither took thetrouble to sound their horn. One onwrong side of street.
