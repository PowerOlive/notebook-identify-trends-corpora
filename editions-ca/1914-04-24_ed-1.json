CHIEF OF POLICE ORDERS
WAR ON NEGRO VAGRANTS
Chief of Police Fred Link has 'de
clared war on all vagrants in the city,
and orders have been issued to the
members of the police department to
take into custody all negroes, both
male and female, who are to be found
without a visible means of support.
With the-approach of the busy sea
son in the country and numerous po
sitions that are open to household la
bor, there should not be a negro with
out employment. Constant complaints
of farmers being unable to secure
help in the busy season, and of the ina
bility to retain household help in the
city, has aroused the police to action.
Hereafter, according to Chief of
Police Link, the vagrant law will be
enforced to the letter. Negroes who
are found idle will be given a chance
to secure employment and if they fail
to heed the warning, they will be ar
rested, tried under the vagrant law
and if convicted will be forced to
work out their fines on the streets.
