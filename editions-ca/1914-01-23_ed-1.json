Veiller's thrilling new
drama,. "Within the Law," ,of which
locaL theatre-goers jflave heard"1 and
read a great deal because of the sen
satipnal success scored by this play in
New York, 1 and Chicago, in both of
which -cities' it was labelled by the
I critics as the "real dramatic triumph
of the year."
"Within the Law," which exerts an
almost irresistable appeal, is aptly de
scribed as a drama or daring in which
the heroine is forced to begin war
fare upon the kvw to protect herself
from its machinations. Mary Turner,
the central character. Is falsely ac
cused of the theft of gpods'from the
establishment in which she is employ
ed, and sente4ced to three years' im
prisonment. She serves her time,
tries to support herself honestly aft
erward, but the police harass and
"hound" her. When they have
' forced her 'out of several places by
recalling her imprisonment, the girl,
in desperation, defies them, and pro
claims' that as they have compelled
her to a career of crime she will beat
them, and stay "witnin the law," too.
Then retribution begins to shape
itself. She becomes the leader of a
band of crooks. Any scheme that
can be profitably handled without
overstepping the legal boundaries
she takes up beats a sharp, un
scrupulous swindler at his own game,
steers skillfully between blackmail
and perfectly proper 'compromise, ex
plaining that it's all a matter of hav
ing a lawyer to make anything safe
through the queer ethics X)f his pro
fession. Meanwhile she avenges
herself on the canting hypocrite who
sent, her to prison by marrying his
son'. Then one of her associates, an
ex-burglar, is tempted against her
command iato robbing the residence
of the father of the man she had
wedded. A "stool pigeon" (meaning,
a police spy, in the vernacular) has
arranged it. The girl "tries to save
them, even after .they have entered
the house, liut It is too late. In the
rush the informer ' is killed. And
when the police break in, husband
and wife are chatting together nerv
ously to stave off disaster.
Then - comes the big thrill "the
third degree examination of all par
ties by a police inspector made to get
the murdexer. In an intense scene
the guilty man finally confesses, part
ly because of nervous strain and part
ly because of his lore for the girl.
From thia joint the play in a series
of artful aad tinewy tcenes, reaches
a climax that ! fairly nerve-gripping
in its .dramatic intensity.

"The Madcap Duchess" at Lexington
A real comic opera, .with real mnsic
and a real story with a singing act
ress "in the title role are only a few of
the many reasons why Miss Ann
Swinburne in Victor Herbert's latest
opera, "Tha Madcap Duchess," has
been 'received with such pronounced
success in New York.. Miss Swin
burne comes here direct from the
Globe Theatre in New York, where
she. has been appearing successfully
since early last fall. The Lexington
engagement is limited to one per
formance, Wednesday night, January
28,, at the Lexington Opera House.
"The Madcap Duchess" is an exquis
ite light opera and in the long history
of light opera in this country there
has never been a more delightful
work than this Victor Herbert's lat
est offering. Every melody has been
written lovingly, and in harmonizing
the accompaniments and working out
the esemble, the composer has pro
duced some of the most delicate ef
fects. "Love is a Story That's Old'
"Do You Kow," the Madrigal and the
Shepherd's Dance are numbers that
are sure to charm one. While Miss
Swinburne has not 'been seen in Lex
ingto in over three years she has
made wonderful progress during that
time and she stands today at the
head of prima donnas associated with
light operain this country. Messrs
David Stevens and Justin HuntlyMc
Carty have supplied her with a role
that fits her like a glove. Dainty and
winsome at ali times she interpets
the music that falls to her lot with
freshness and vigor born of a tru& art
ist. Not in many, many years has
there been an opera mounted so
sumptuously. There is a wealth of
color on the stage and yet it is a.11
in good teste, credit for which must
go to Mr. Fred Latham,- who staged
the piece.
The piece is in two acts, with the
locale is and near Paris, Prance, and
concerns a capricious young Duchess
of Buaaurac. whose escapades after
eluding her guardian, lead her into
many adventures, and eventually a
pretty love affair with Renand, Prince
of St. Pol. The company carries its
own orchestra of twenty men under
the direction 'of Robt. Hood Bowers.
Orders for seats sent to Manager
Scott will receive prompt attention if
accompanied by remittance and a self
