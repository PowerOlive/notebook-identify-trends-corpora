One Girl's
Luck
Surely Seemed Like It.
Bobby had endeavored to remove a
glass of jam from the closet-shelr.
The glass had slipped from his fin
gers and crashed to the floor, making
a sad muss. "Oh, myj" said JBobby,
when the speech of which horror bad
deprived him hac returned. "O my!
Some one's been monkey'n with that
jam!"
Speak Kindly.
If in our speech we would only con-,
eider how our words will affect those
to whom they are spoken if we would
try to hear them with their ears and
consider how they affect hearts, there
would not be much passionate or un
advised speech; certainly there would
be few spirits wounded or lives em
bittered by the words of our lips.-rr

"It's funny how we never appreciate
our own good luck," said the .little
stenographer as she pinned tissue-paper
around 'her clean, stiff cuffs pre
paratory to attacking the day's work.
"Well?" The 'bookkeeper's tone
called for particulars. Then he asked:
"What special luck has befallen you?"
"Oh, It's just the glory-of being able
to work," she declared. "Think of
earning one's own living! Think of
being a business woman, free from
all the cares and tribulations of home
life nothing to do but earn a nice
little salary that I'm sure of getting
each week!
"I'm much to be envied by my sis
ters in society, the poor butterflies
who are forced to stay, up late night
after night, while I'm renewing my
beauty such as it is in sleep. The
worn, ennuied, ambitionless girls
who drag out a wretched existence
trying to have a good time how I
pity them! The "
"Here, here!" exclaimed the book
keeper, excitedly. "Stop before you're
all run down. You're overworking
yourself, child. I'm afraid you're go
ing to be ill."
The little stenographer smiled.
"And he thought I meant it!" she ex
claimed, under her breath.
"No, but listen to me!" she insist
ed, 'aloud. "Think of it! Here I get
up at six o'clock mornings, well rested
after a good, long sleep, having gone
to bed at ten no social engagements
having kept me up and I dress in five
or ten minutes, having things all my
own way, being bothered by no maid,
and knowing exactly where my things
are, having put them in certain places
myself the night before. I know ex
actly -what to wear, so I don't have
to worry for an hour to decide which
dress will be most becoming. I just
put on my working dress on work
days and my Sunday dress on Sun
days, and that's all there is to it. Why,
it's beautifully simple. Think of the
joy of having no worry on that score;
then think of the trials of society
belles.
"Then, too, I know exactly where
I'm going every day and just what I'm
going to do. I don't have to worry
and fret over whether I'm insulting
or pleasing by accepting or rejecting
invitations. I don't have to attend
long receptions and meet illustrious
folk and feel alarm lest I won't be
smart enough to talk with them. I
just calmly take a nice, convenient
street car to my daily work. After I
get there I find my day all arranged
for by the firm ho worry whatever
on my part. Shouldn't I appreciate all
that?
"I never. have to face emergencies,
being never called suddenly to some
important social affair in New York or
San Francisco or to Europe. Think of
the popr girls, no older than I, who
suddenly face the dire necessity of
getting twenty or thirty new frocks
and the sundries to attend them!
Think of having to let modistes fit you
to dress after dress, and having to suf
fer in silence, so that the fit of each
may be perfect! For, being in the
public eye, the society girl can't stick
a pin in anywhere to hide a wrinkle
and then stand so that side of her
won't be noticed. She must be abso
lutely perfect all over.
"Think of her troubles, and then
think of me! I can devote any noon
hour to shopping merely by going
without lunch. I can pick up bargains
at any sale. Then in not more than
two or three weeks, by working eve
nings and Saturday afternoons, I can
have a new dress made exactly as I
want it. I don't have to take just
what some dressmaker tells- me I
must have. I can have a low waisted
dress if I want it and that kind is
easier to make when every one is
wearing high waists and on one can
stop me.
"Think, too, of the poor society
girl's having to take along a chaperon
wherever she goes! Why, I can
work nights until ten or eleven any
time the firm wants me to and then
take my five-mile trip home alone, andH
no one says a wrord. I have such per
fect freedom! I can go to a theater '
with just another girl, if I want to,
and, sitting high up, no opera glass
es are turned on me to note with
whom I'm sitting. From my comfort
able chair I can see the poor rich
girl, in tight clothes and a stiff, un
comfortable position for she can't
slouch down and be comfortable try
ing to look unconscious of the opera
glasses turned on her. I can enjoy the
play, but she must be constantly think
ing of herself.
"Say, honestly," declared, the little
stenographer, looking half seriously
at the bookkeeper for an instant, "do
you know, after all, I don't know but
that I'm half right in what I say. I
didn't mean it at all when I said it,
but I've just about convinced myself
that it's a pretty good thing to be me.
"I don't know that I could ever live
up to the requirements of a society
Md," she confessed, "and it's sort of
comforting to know that I can be nat- I
ural once in a while and tell my trou- !
bles to a friend who likes me, not 'my
money.
Then she turned to her typewriter,
humming a' little tune. Chicago Daily
