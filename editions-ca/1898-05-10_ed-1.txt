momentary expectation of cable advices from Commodore Dewey the town was throwninto the wildest excitement at breakfast time Saturday morning by the issue of extra papers announcing- thearrival of the McCulloch at Hong Kongwith dispatches for the governmentfrom Commodore Dewey The publication of newspaper dispatches tellingof terrible mortality among the Spanish and the escape of the Americanforces men and ships from serious injury added to the excitement and tothe intense satisfaction with which thelong expected news was receivedVICE ADMIRAL MONTEJOThe Spanish Commander Who SufferedDefeat at ManilaThere was an instant rush of newspaper men to the navy department tosecure further information from official sources and perhaps dismayed bythe number and impetuosity of thenewspaper contingent the officials ofthe navigation bureau where cipherdispatches are transcribed and translated promptly closed and locked theirdoors against invasion One of the officers of the bureau had been on dutyevery moment of the 2 i hours for several iveeks past waiting to receive ca-blegiains of importance- Secretary Long at 1030 oclock readthe following to newspaper men asDeweys dispatchManila May 1 The squadron arrived at Manila at daybreak this morning Immediately engaged the enemyand destroyed the following Spanishvessels Reina Christina Castilla Ulloa Isle de Cuba General Lezo theDuero Correo Velasco Mindanao onetransport and the water battery atCavite The squadron is aminjuredand only a few men were slightlywounded The only means of telegraphing is to the American consul atHonjr Kong I shall communicate withhim DeweyIt is said at the navy departmentth advices also show that Deweysforces were not sufficient to make alanding but that this in no way interfered with the complete control he exercises over the city and its fortificationsShortly before noon Secretary Longleft the navy department for the whitehouse and an official confirmation wasmade that a second dispatch from Cornmore Dewey had been received Thesecretary carried this with him tothe white house and pending theconference with the president therewas intense eagerness among thewaiting crowd to learn the contentsof the second dispatch Senatorswho saw the president securedbrief intimation that Deweys victorywas overwhelming and that he had alarge number of Spanish prisoners inhis possession At 1230 SecretaryLong came from the presidents private room carrying the copy of thesecond message from Dewey but inorder to give equal facilities to thegreat crowd of people waiting to gaininformation he held it until he reachedhis private office Then his secretaryMr Finney brought the message tothe large reception room where adred or more anxious newspaper correspondents and curious observerstook the dispatch as Mr Finney readit It was as followsCavite Mav 4 1S9SLong Secretary Navy 1 have taken possession of the naval station atCavite Philippine islands and destroyed its fortifications - Haye destroyed

9 Secretary Longafter reading the dispatch from Commodore Dewey said It was a mostwonderful naval achievement and reflects the greatest credit on our officersand men The fire from our shipsmust have been so effective that theSpanish were in a manner stunnedThey could not recover themselves until the battle was lostSecretary Alger said after the cabinet meeting that he hoped to send10000 trcops to Manila to sail fromSan Francisco in a few daysGen Miles says that he can send ashigh as 10000 men if so many areneeded to Commodore Dewe3r if thetransports are ready at that timeTroops will be sent as soon as theycan be gotten transportWashington May 9 The department is almost bewildered by the completeness of Commodore Deweys vieto The officials until they got theofficial dispatches could not conceivethe possibility of our not suffering theloss of any men It seemed an impossibility The official report is perfectly clear however Commodore Deweysaying that only a few of his men werehurtNot less remarkable than this wasthe fact that our vessels escaped injury Our fleet smashed into the Spanish so quickly and with such impetuosity that he smothered the Spanishfire and had them in a bewildered andhelpless condition before they could dohis fleet damage He is in possessionof the island and is secure but needsmore menLondon May 9 The Hong Kongcorrespondent of the Daily Mail givesthe

the boat but our gunswere turned on her and tore her topieces She went to the bottom withall on board Several vessels close inshore behaved in the same way andshared her fateThe Spaniards had fought to theirlast gasp and now surrendered Theyhad been annonncing that the Americans would kill every one in Caviteand when we landed a long processionof priests and sisters of mercy met theboat from the Petrel and beggedour men not to injure the woundedin the hospitals As a matter offact the Americans rescued some 300Spaniards andVsent them ashore Allthe Spanish vessels are destroyed with2000 men

Ingenuity However Got Them OutKey West Fla May 9 Only poormarksmanship on the part of theSpanish gunners saved the Vicksburgand the cutter Morrill from destructionoff Havana Saturday morning Forover half an hour they were under thefire of the guns of the Santa Clarawater batteries but both escaped without material injury although shrapnel shells from eight inch guns exploded all about them and both nowshow the pitted scars of the SpanishbulletsThe wily Spaniards had arranged atrap to send a couple of our ships tothe bottom They baited it as a manwould bait a trap A small schoonerwas sent out from Havana harborshortly before daylight Saturday morning to draw some of the Americans into the ambuscade The ruse workedlike a charm TheVicksburg and theMorrill in the heat of the chase and intheir contempt for Spanish gunnerywalked into the trap that had been setfor them Had the Spaniards possessedtheir souls in patience but five minuteslonger not even the bad gun practicewould have saved our ships and Sunday morning two more of our vessels would lie at the bottom withintwo lengths of the wreck of the illstarred MaineFriday evening the Vicksburg andthe Morrill cruising to the west of JMorro Castle were fired upon by thebig guns of the Cojimar batteries Twoshots were fired at the Vicksburg andone at the Morrill Both fell shortand both vessels without returningthe fire steamed out of range Itwould have been folly to have doneotherwise But Saturday morning theSpaniards had better luck Theschooner they had sent out before daylight ran off to the eastward huggingthe shqre with the wind on her starboard quarter About three miles eastof the entrance of the harbor she cameover on the port tack A light hazefringed the horizon and she was notdiscovered until three miles off shorewhen the Mayflower made her out andsignalled the Morrill and VicksburgCapt Smith of the Morrill and Commander Lilly of the Vicksburg immediately slapped on all steam and started in pursuitThe schooner instantly put aboutand ran for Morro Castle before thewind On doing so she would according to the well conceived Spanish plotlead the two American war ships directly under the guns of the SantaClara batteries These works are ashort mile east of Morro and are apart of the defense of the harborThere are two batteries one at theshore nvhich has been orecentlythrown up of sand and mortar withkvi dbvembrasu resil 6rieisrHtrinchri sruu sand tne - other on the erest ofthe rocky eminence which juts out intothe water of the gulf at the pointThe upper battery mounts modern 10inch and 12 inch Krupp guns behind asix foot stone parapet in front of whichare 20 feet of earthwork and a beltingof railroad iron This battery is considered the most formidable of Havanas defenses except Morro castleIt is masked and has not been absolutely located by the American warships It is probably due to the factthat the Spaniards did not desire toexpose the position that the Vicksburgand Morrill are now afloat The Morrill and Vicksburg were G miles from theschooner when the chase began Theysteamer at her full speed the Morrillleading until within a mile and a halfof the Santa Clara batteries Commander Smith of the Vicksburg wasthe first to realize the danger intowhich the reckless pursuit had ledthem He concluded it was time tohaul off and sent a shot across thebow of the schooner The Spanishskipper instantly brought his vesselabout but while she was still rollingin the trough of the sea with her sailsflapping an eight inch shrapnel shellcame hurling through the air fromthe water battery a mile and ahalf away It passsed over theMorrill between the pilot house andthe smoke stack and exploded less than50 feet on the port quarter The smallshot rattled against her sides It wasa close call Two more shots followedin quick succession both ShrapnelOne burst close under the star boardquarter filling the engine room withthe smoke of the explosion of theshell and the other like thefirst passed over and exploded just beyond The Spanishgunners had the range and their timefuses were accurately set The crewsof both ships were at their gunsLieut Craig who was in charge of thebow four inch rapid fire gun of theMorrill asked for and obtained permission to return the fire At the firstshot the Vicksburg which was in thewake of the Morrill slightly inshoresheered off and

Good HousekeepingROBERT LOUtS STEVEfisbn fPART ICHAPTER III ContinuedThe poor captain raised his eyes andai one look the rum went out of himand left him staring sober The expression of his face was not so much of terror as of mortal sickness He made amovement to rise but I do not believehe had enough force left in his bodyNow Bill sit where you are saidthe beggar If I cant see I can hear alinger stirring Business is businessHold out your left hand Boy take hisleft hand by the wrist and bring itnear my rightWe both obeyed him to the letter andI saw him pass something from thehollow of the hand that held his stickinto the palm of the captains whichclosed upon it instantlyAnd now thats done said the blindman and at the words he suddenlyleft hold of me and with incredibleaccuracy and nimbleness skipped outof the parlor and into the road whereas 1 stood motionless I could hear hisstick go tap-tap-tapping into the distanceIt was some time before either I orthecaptainseemed to gather our sensesbut at length and about the same moment I released his wrist which I wasstill holding and he drew in his handand looked sharply into the palmTen oclock he cried Six hoursWell do them yet and he sprung to hisfeetEven as he did so he reeled put hishand to his throat stood swaying fora momenti and then with a peculiarsoundf ell from his whole height faceforemtfsJthflQpi oI -ran to- him at onceY calling inymother But haste was all in vainThe captain had been struck dead bythundering apoplexy It is a curiousthing to understand for I had certainly never liked the man though of lateI had begun to pity him but as soonas I saw that he was dead I burst intoa flood of tears It was the seconddeath I had known and the sorrow ofthe first was still fresh in my heartCHAPTER IVTHE SEA CHESTI lost no time of course in tellingniy mother all that I knew and perhapsshould have told her long before andwe saw ourselves at once in a difficultand dangerous position Some of themans money if he had any was certainly due to us but it was not likelythat our captains shipmates above allthe two specimens seen by me BlackBog and the blind beggar would beinclined to give up their booty in payment of the dead mans debts The-captains order to mount at once andride for Dr Livesey would have left inymother alone and tinprotected whichwas not to be thought of Indeed itseemed impossible for either of us toremain much longer in the house thefall of coals in the kitchen grate thevery ticking of the clock filled us withalarmsThe neighborhood to our earsseemed haunted by approaching footsteps and what between the dead bodyof the captain on the parlor floor andthe thought of that detestable blindbeggar hovering near at hand and2eady to return there were momentswhen as the saying goes I jumped inmy skin for terror Something mustspeedily be resolved upon and it occurred to us at last to go forth toft gether and seek help in the neighboring hamlet Iosooner said than doneBare headed as we were we ran outat once in the gathering evening andi the frosty fogThe hamlet lay not many hundredyards away though out of view on theother aide o the next cove and whatreatly endouraged me it was in anopposite direction frpm that whencethe blind man had made his appearance and whither he had presumabljeturned We were not many minutesn the road though we sometimestopped to lay hold of each other andfcearken But there was no unusualound nothing but the low -wash ofhe ripple and the croaking of therows in the woodIt was already candle light when wereached the hamlet and I shall neverforget how much 1 was cheered to seethe yellow shine in doors and windowsbut that as it proved was the hostof the help we were likely to gat inthat quarter For you would havethought men would have been ashamedof themselves no soul would consentto return with us to the Admiral Benbow The more we told of our troubles the more roanwoman and childthey clung to the shelter of theirhouses The name of Capt Flintthough it was strange to me was wellenough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror Someof the men who had been to field workon the far side of the Admiral Benliow remembered besides to have seenseveral strangers on the road and taking them to be smugglers to have bolted away and one at least had seena little lugger in what we called KittsHole For that matter anjone whowas a comrade of the captains wasenough to frighten them to death Andthe short and the long of the matterwas that while we could get severalwho were willing-enough toride toDr Liveseys which lay in another direction not one would help us to defend the innThey say cowardice is infectious butthen argument is on the other handa great emboldener and so when eachhad his say my mother made them aspeech She would not she declaredlose money that belonged to her fatherless boy if none of the rest of youdare she said Jim and I dare Backwe will go the way we came and smallthanks to you big hulking chickenhearted men Well have that chestopen if we die for it And Ill thankyou for that bag Mrs Crossley to bringback our lawful money inOf course I said I would go with nrymother and of course they all criedout at our foolhardiness but even thennot a man would go along with us Allthey would do was to give me a loadedpistol lest we were attacked and topromise to have horses ready saddledin case we were pursued on our return while one lad was to ride forward to the doctors in search of armedassistanceMy heart was beating fiercely whenwe two set forth in the cold night uponthis dangerous venture A full moonwas Ibeginning to rise and peered red1y through the upper edges of the fogand this increased our haste for itwas plain before we came forth againthat all would be bright as day andour departure exposed to the eyes ofany watchers We slipped along thehedges noiseless and swift nor did weseo or hivy anything to increase ourterrors till to our Ivige relief the dooro7 the Admiral Benbow had closed behind usI slipped the bolt at once and westood and panted for a moment in thedark alone in the house with the deadcaptains body Then mother got acandle in the bar and holding eachothers hands we advanced into theparloi He lay as we had left him onhis back with his ejes open and onearm stretched outDraw down the blind Jim whispered my mother they might comeand watch outside And now saidshe when I had done so we have toget the key off that and whos to touchit I should like to know and she gavea kind of sob as she said the wordsI went down on knees at onceOn the floor close to his hand there wasa little round of paper blackened onthe one sideiXP could tfofdouTH thatthis was the black spot and taking itup I found written on the other sidein a very good clear hand this shortmessage You have till ten to nightHe had till ten mother said I andjust as I said it our old clock beganstriking This sudden noise startled usshockingly but the news was goodfor it was only six2bw Jim she said that keyI felt in his pockets one after another A few small coins a thimbleand some thread and big needles apiece of pigtail tobacco bitten away atthe end his gully with the crookedhandle a pocket compass and a tinderbox were all that they contained and Ibegan to despairPerhaps its round his neck suggested my motherOvercoming a strong repugnance Itore open his shirt at the neck andthere sure enough hanging to a bit oftarry string which I cut with his owngully we found the key At this triumph we were -filled with hope andhurried upstairs without delay to thelittle room where he had slept so longand where his box had stood since theday of his arrivalIt was like any other seamans cheston the outside the initial B burnedon the top of it with a hot iron andthe cornels -somewhat smashed andbroken as by long rough usageGive me the key said my motherand though the lock was very stiff shehad turned it and thrown back the lidin a twinklingA strong smell of tobacco and tarrose from the interior but nothingwas to be seen on the top except a suitof very good clothes brushedand folded They had never been wornmy mother said Under that the miscellany began a quadrant a tin canikin several sticks of tobacco two braceof very handsome pistols a piece ofbar silver an old Spanish watch andsome other trinkets of little value andmostly of foreign make a pair of compasses mounted with brass and five orsix curious West Indian shells It hasoften set me thinking since that heshould have carried about these shellstAvitli him in his wanderincsruiltvhunted lifeIn the meantime we had found nothing of any value but the silver and thetrinkets and neither of these were inour way Underneath there was anodboat cloak whitened with sea salt on-many a harbor bar My mother pulledit up with impatience and there laybefore us faielast things in the chesta bundle tiedup in oil cloth and looking like papers alld a canvas bag thatgave forth at a touch the jingle ofgold tIll show those rogues that Im anhonest woman said my mother Illhave my dues and not afarthing overHold Mrs Crossleys bagl And she began to count over the amount of thecaptains score from the sailors baginto the one that I waslioldingIt wasa long difficult- business forthesizes r doubloons and louis dors andguineas and pieces of eight and I knownot what besides all shaken together atrandom The guineas too were aboutthe scarcest and tit was with these onlythat ray mother knew how to make hercountWhen we were about half waythrough I suddenly put my hand uponher arm for I had heard in the silentfrosty air a sound that brought myheart into my mouth the tap tappingof the blind mans stick upon the frozenroad It drew nearer and nearerwhile we sat holding our breath Thenit struck sharp on the inn door andthen we could hear the handle beingturned and the bolt rattling as thewretched being tried to enter and thenthere was a long time of silence bothwithin and without At last the tapping recommenced and to our indescribable joy and gratitude died slowly away again until it ceased to beheardMother said I take the wholeand lets be going for I was sure thebolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornets nest about our ears though howthankful I was that I had bolted it nonecould tell who had never met this terrible blind manBut my mother frightened as shewas would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her andwas obstinately unwilling to be contentwith less It was not yet seven shesaid by a long way she knew herrights and she would have them andshe was still arguing with me when alittle low whistle sounded a good wayoff among the hills That was enoughand more than enough for both of usTil take what I have she saidjumping to her feetAnd Ill take this to square thecount said I picking up the oilskinpacketNext moment we were both groping downstairs leaving the candle bythe empty chest and the next we hadopened the door and were in full retreat We had not started a momenttoo soon The fog was rapidly dispersing already the moon shone quiteclear on the high ground on either sideand it was only in the exact bottom ofthe dell and round the cabin door thata thin veil still hung unbroken to conceal the first steps of our escape Farless than half way to the hamlet verylittle bejond the bottom of the hill wemust come forth into the moonlightNor was this all for the sound of several footsteps running came alreadyto our ears and as we looked back intheir direction a light tossing to andfro and still rapidly advancing showedthat one of the newcomers carried alanternMy dear said my mother suddenly take the money and run on I amgoing to faintThis was certainly the end of bothof us i thought How I cursed thecoins were

thevery rocks reechoed and the men cameout again one after another on theroad and declared that we were nowhere to be- found And just then thesame whistle that had alarmed mymother and myself over the dead captains money was once more clearlyaudible through the night but thistime twice repeated I had thought itto be the blind mans trumpet so tospeak summoning his crew to the assault but I now found that it was asignal from the hill side toward thehamlet and from its effect upon thebuccaneers a signal to warn them ofapproaching dangerTheres Dirk again said oneTwice Well have to budge matesBudge

howI found the strength to do it at all andI am afraid it was roughly done but Imanaged to drag her down the bankand a little way under the arch Further I could not move her for thethe bridge was too

swiftly pastThe thrsty cattle stood aghastWith frenzied eye and heated breathThen turned and fled the scene of deathAgain I saw the dreary wasteTjo Labors bands made busy hasteThe plowmans steady sturdy strideThe stone and stubble parted wideThe plowshare rent the stubborn groundWith jarring unrelenting soundUntil its quivering heart lay bareTo blind night rain and noonday glareAnon the furrows broad and deepRan straight as paths swift arrows keepAnd forth the sower came to sowWith wisely cautious step and slowHis provident Impartial handDispensing blessing oer the landAnd far and near the seed was sownBeauty for ashes bread for stoneAnd then behold a fertile fieldIn golden wealth of fruitful yieldThe plowmans pathway mercilessArrayed in shining plentousnessWhose mellow incense fed the breezeTo serve a thousand ministries-What once was dead gave life to throngsWhat once was dumb burst forth in songsO bruised broken bleeding heartBehold In this thy counterpartThe furrows

with a weaknessfor statistics has published the resultof studious investigation in registry offices and other records of womanschance of marriage The term womanis elastic She may be a maiden from15 to 75 or a widow from 21 to 80 andaccording to these cheerful statisticsstill stand a chance of drawing a matrimonial prize The best time for aspinster to marry or at least the timewhen she has the greatest number ofopportunities is the period betweenher twenty fifth and twenty ninthyears One out of eight spinsters marries at this age Next besttothisistheperiod between 20 and 24 when one in13 marries then comes from 30 to 34when one in 23 marries Between theages of 35 and 39 statistics show onlyone marriage in 28 After 40 the chancesare not encouraging although morewomen between tie ages of 40 and 50marry than do girls between the agesof 15 and 19 one in 73 being the poorshowing for the bread-and-buttermissesBut these facts are not the only onesof interest to unmated women thatstatistics show For instance so thatno time may be lost by the husbandhunting maid the statistician pointsout that it is folly for a woman to wasteher energy trying to entrap a man ofsome ages whereas if she directed herattention to another sort of man shemight find a conquest ready to herhand As an illustration of this abachelor of from 25 to 35 is worth toa woman as a marrying man 50 youngbachelors of from 15 to 19 for thechance of the older man marrying within one year is 50 times as great as thechance of one of the younger menThen a more common instance a bachelor of from 25 to 35 is worth threetimes as much to any woman as amarrying man as a bachelor from 35to 45It is encouraging to learn that the excess of spinsters is only 75 to every1000 bachelors But to offset this isthe disquieting fact that there are 230widows to every 100 widowers whichthe statistician admits does tend towork against the interest of spinsterswho wish to marry The spinster offrom 15 to 34 is more apt to marry abachelor than a widower at ages 34to 44 her chance of bachelors is stillbetter than with widowers but after45 she has to take a widower or remain single and even then her offersare not as numerous as those of thewidow The best time for a widow whowishes to wed a bachelor is from 15 to34 after 34 she has a better chanceto marry a widower The chances ofspinsters over 30 marrying

reporters given innewspapers as a rule is not entitled torespect or credence It is generallyassumed that the reporter writes chieflyor wholly to make a sensation or insome way interest readers without regard to facts while just the reverse isthe truth in all reputable newspaper establishmentsIt is safe to assume that the statements of reporters given in the leadingreputable journals of the country arequite as truthful as are the generastatements from the pulpit when theminister gets outside of strictly religious teachings and very much moretruthful than are the public expressionsof most if not all of the leading professionsWith very fewrexceptiohs thenianligement of our letid ing daily newspapers enforce truthfulness and fairnessas the supreme attributes for a newspaper writer and yet it is common forall who are displeased with any reportorial statement to say that its a merenewspaper storyNot only are the managers of ourleading newspapers entitled to greatcredit for the scrupulous care they en 1force on their reporters and correspondents to present the truth withas exact fairness as is possible but thepublic little know the ceaseless carethat is exercised in every reputablenewspaper

Provided ItIs Given Properly and Especiallyin Reasonable QuantitiesCornmeal is a good thing to feedhens if it be fed properly and in properqtiantities The writer has been verycareful not to feed either corn or cornmeal to an extent to induce a too greatamount of fat This is about the onlyobjection in feeding cornmeal to afully developed hen With growingchicks there is the added danger thatthe fowls will not get enough ash tomake iirm bones When hens are laying freely it is somewhat difficult toget them fat and at this time the feeding of cornmeal once a day seems tabe a very good thing This springwhen the hens of the writer were confined for some weeks on account of thesnow they showed that indigestionhad taken hold of them hard greendroppings appearing in numerousplaces under the roosts Knowingwell that family physicians sometimesorder the patients to eat more cornmeal food when a lax condition of thebowels is desired we made a likechange in the food of the hens Weput a small quantity in a pan and pourboiling water over it and then stir itup thoroughly The pan is then puton top of the hot stove and allowedto cook for say five minutes when itbecomes a thickened mass After being allowed to cool to a point wherethe fowls can eat it without burningtheir mouths this is fed before anyother food is given The fowls seemto enjoy this warm morning meal morethan any other of the day The resultthis spring has been that the signs oiindigestion have already disappearedand the hens are laying vigorously Oneof the hens had shown sonic smallsigns of roup and the feeding of thewarm soft meal has seemed to havean excellent effect on her about allsigns of the trouble having disappeared The philosophy of this is plainRoup is principally an affection of themucous membrane and the warm soflmeal is easy on that membrane Wedo not say that she showed somesj mptoms of it It inay have beennothing but a slight cold We wantthis understood for we do not wish tcbe tinderstood that cornmeal cookedcan be regarded in any sense as a curefor roup It might be possible that inits early stages the feeding of foodsthat are easy on the mucous membranemight have a tendency to retard theprogress of the disease to such an extent that nature would be able to bringabout normal conditions and throw offthe diseaseCornmeal so prepared is fed only inthe morning and that too only to anextent that can be eaten To balancethis whole oats are kept before thefowls for the rest of the day the onlyother food being table scraps At nightthe oat trough is taken out of reachso that the hens cannot fill upon themin the morning before the cornmealis given to them Even the water istaken out at night for the same reasonWe doubt if this will be found to beadvisable in the summer time whenthe hens have all the green grass theycan eat and are also laying fewer eggsThe rest they take in the summermakes it easy for them to lay on fatand this would be more likely to bethe case in the summer than in theearly spring We have spoken of thisbecause at this time of year many millions of birds are lost by indigestiondue entirely to improper feeding Indigestion probably kills more fowls inthe spring than any other trouble atthis time yf vear Farmers ReviewGAPES IN CHICKENSBirds Afflicted with This DiseaseShould Be Separated from Othersand Kept on Board FloorsThe presence of gapes will be
