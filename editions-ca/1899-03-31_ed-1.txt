ObtainedThe Most Amicable Relations Withthe United States Is WantedWashington March 29 SenorsJose Ft Villalon and A Hevia whowere appointed by the Cuban assemblyto present to the Washington authorities the resolutions of that body havearrived in this city Their mission inaddition to the presentation of theresolutions is to explain in detail thesituation with reference to the insurgent aimy While the assemblydid not reject the 3000000 which GenGomez arranged with Mr Robert PPorter to receive and pay off the Cubantroops they believed it to be entirelyinadequate to meet the situation Theydesire at least 10000000 and as muchmore as can be obtained They arguethat if the Cuban army is disbandedafter the distribution of but 33000 000which would give to each enlisted manabout 68 that the money so obtained would be barely sufficient forthem to procure clothes and return tctheir homes leaving them no marginupon which to enter upon the peacefulpursuits of life Without the meansof subsistence Senor Villalon saysthat disorders would almost inevitably follow and perhaps brigandageThe object both of the United Statesand of the assembl3T says M r Villalon is to secure tranquility inCuba preparatory to the settling upby the Cuban people of an independent government and he saysthat it is therefore as much tothe interests of the United States authorities as to those who immediatelyrepresent the Cuban patriots to seethat the disbanded soldiers are givenan opportunity to return tocmr pursuits The assembly represents not the Cuban peopleMr Villalon declares but only thosewho have been in arms struggling fortheir independence Had Cuba achievedher absolute independence he says therevolutionary assembly would haveraised sufficient funds to pay off thearmy in full and in as much as theUnited States now assumes and exercises the functions of a trustee for theCuban people during thement of order throughout the islandpreparatory to the establishment of astable and independent governmenthe as the representative of theassembly will urge that itis the duty of the UnitedStates to furnish ample fundsrepayable subsequently out of the Cuban revenues They desire that theWashington authorities shall fully understand the dangers which may follow if the insurgents are disbandedand sent to their homes without adequate means to begin life afresh Ifthe United States adheres to the present understanding with Gen Gomezand the army is disbanded upon the83000000 basis and disorder followsthe assembly wants its skirts clear ofresponsibilitySenor Villalon says that the assembly desires the most amicable relations with the United States thatnothing could exceed the gratitude ofthe Cubans for the aid the UnitedStates has rendered but they can nottoo strongly emphasze the belief thatthe problem of the future would begreatly simplified if enough funds aredistributed among the Cuban soldiersnow to insure their being able to return to peaceful pursuits The assembly will Senor Villalon says probably be dissolved as soon as the armyis disbanded as it represents only theCubans in arms He believes thatwithin a year a convention representing the whole Cuban people will meetand frame a constitution and be readyfor the assumption of the duties of selfgovernmentSenor Villalon and his colleague willprobably seek an audience with thepresident himself and if this is deniedthem they will see the secretary oiwar If the president receives thesegentlemen it will be as visiting citizens not in their representative capacity No such recognition will be accorded them If theydesire to present a petition or requestto this government it will have to gothrough the ordinary channels and inthis instance it will be through themilitary arm of the government Sucha petition when presented will be referred to Gen Brooke as military governor of Cuba and the one person authorized to deal with Cuban affairs Itis also probable that these Cubans willbe told that any answer to

first the step wereof wood but deeper down they were ofunhewn stonePerhaps 40 feet from the surface -ofthe earth they found themselves in along narrow cavern which woundabount like a serpents trail And whenhad gone perhaps 200 yards fromtheir starting point they found themselves stopped by a brick wall in whichwas a rustv iron door The door waslocked but a bunch of keys hung on ahook near byWe have found him said LampkinHendricks nodded as he began to trythe keys in the lock After many failures the door was finally opened andin the combined light of the lanternand a streak of daylight that came inat a tiny crack in the rock they sawcrouching in a corner a white facedcreature with walling eyes and disheveled hairWho is it came from his lips in arasping whisperFriends said HendricksGielow tried to rise but fell backwardIn Gods name water he gaspedHere drink this first said Lampkinkneeling and drawing out from hispocket a flask of brandy Gielow triedto take the bottle in his hands but hisfingers were too stiff from cold DrLampkin placed the bottle to his lipsand Gielow drankOh thank God he said Is it trueare vou friendsThU is Mr Minard Hendricks answered Lampkin with a glance at theholder of the lantern and Miss Huntington is outside in a carriage waitingto take you homeOh no really cried the prisonerand then he lowered his head to hisknees and laughed like a happy childIt seems like years since I came hereHe tried again to rise but Lampkinstopped himYou must first drink some of thisliquid food he saidAs he opened the bottle Gielow eyedit like a famished beast As he wastakiig it from a spoon from the doetors hands Hendricks peered outthrough the crackI have the solution now he remarked In cutting the new roadalong here they came within a fewfeet of chopping the end off this cavern The blasting caused the crackHe must have thrust his messagethrough itGielow nodded as he ate but he madeno commentNow that is enough for the present said Lampkin We must get youout of here and warm you up before wedo anything elseThey raised the artist to his feet andbore him slowly between them alongthe dark passage and up the darkstairs to the hall aboveWell take him

went out toJjxe The green curtain wasstill down but he saw that it was pulledaside and that the occupant was peer1ing cautiously out When she saw himcoining she opened the carriage doorand looked anxiously into his faceHendricks smiledGielow is safe he said He isweak of course but he will pull throughall rightShe seemed unable either to answeror to move The stare of her eyesseemed to indicate doubt on her part asto the verity of the news1 think you might come in if youwish added Hendricks We have puthim to bed and the doctor is preparingsomething warm for himWithout a word she got out of thecarriage and dumbly followed himA they were ascending the steps shepaused half way up the flight andlooked at Hendricks pitifully and thendown at her feet Her knees bent andshe clutched his armI I dont know whats the matterwith me she faltered I dont seemable to move Oh please pardon myweaknessIts the shock said Hendricks almost tenderly You must trj to calmyourself All the trouble is over youknow and the prisoner is in chainsI thought something serious hadhappened she said slowly recoveringI heard the crash and then as you didnot appear and the sergeant remainedI thought something was wrongPerhaps you had better go back tothe carriage and not try to go in suggested HendricksThe remark seemed to rouse her toactionOh no I must see him I can helpand releasing his arm she mounted thesteps unaidedHendricks led her to the door of theroom where they had taken GielowLampkin appeared on the thresholdHes begging to see you Miss Huntington said heHe pushed the door open and whenshe had gone in he closed it and stoodfacing Hendricks For a moment theylooked into each others eyes withoutspeaking Then Hendricks turnedaway abruptlyHe went into a little alcove off thebig reception room and glancing atDenham and the sleeping Indian herang the telephoneHe ordered from the nearest policestation a patrol wagon for the prisonerand an ambulance with all the comforts available for the transportationof an inalid Then he came aud lookeddown at Kolas faceT presume you found Gielow prettybad off remarked Denham There wassomething in his tone which showedvast respect for HendricksHendricks nodded and then hestretched his hand over Kola to theyoung officerMy boy you saved three lives thismorning and showed the sort of stuffyou are made of I shall never forgetyou Vou wont lose by it I shallspeak o your chief about ou If heever goes back on you or you need employment cdtne to meDenham flushed to the roots of hishairThank you Mr Hendricks hesaid feelinglyAt this juncture the Indian openedhis eyes and stared fixedly at HendricksI hate you Hendricks were hisfirst wordsFlies seem to do the same thing inthe summer answered Hendricksdrily but I manage to get along Iam not bald headedIf you will guarantee safety tome said Kola after a moments deliberation I will restore Gielow toyou He may be alive yet but if I donot reveal the secret of his hiding placehe will never see the light of day Itell you I am positively the only livingpossessor of the secretHendricks face wore a comical expression He glanced at Denham andsaidRich isnt itDenham nodded and Kolas bead likeeyes rolled back and forth wondering-y as his gaze vibrated between themIt is not an unreasonable requestsaid heYou forget replied Hendrickssuavely that you have already courteouslv volunteered all the informationnecessary You are a gem Count Bantinni You actually do so many gooddeeds that you forget about them Youof course remember telling us aboutthe head of the dragon the lanternthe stone stairs the long cavern andthe cell at the endKolas face darkened He reflecteda moment and then saidI see you made me talk unconsciously I acknowledge that you have undone me completelyHe sat up and his handcuffs clankedas he folded his hands over his kneeIs Gielow alive he questionedThanks yes said HendricksWell I am giad of that anyway Hestood between me and my desire thatsall I had against himHalf an hour later Hendricks wentout on the veranda aud looked downthe road Dr Lampkin was there walking back and forthHows Gielow asked the detectiveTip top answered the doctorHell be at his easel in a week Howsthe prisonerResigned and meek as a lamb answered the detective He madeWE HAVE FOUND HIMplete confession to Denham and myself just nowAnd I presume the mystery is solvedat last remarked Lampkin tentatively I must say however thatI am still in the dark on one or twofeatures of the case For instance itseems an unnecessary thing for Kolato cremate the body and inform youanonymously that the remains wouldbe found in the hotelThat seems to have been an afterthought and there was a reason for itexplained Hendricks He was spending a pleasant evening with his victimin Caruthers rooms and committed thedeed sooner than he really intendedCaruthers it appears was just beginning to suspect that Kola was not anItalian and a dispute arose befweenthem Kola struck him a single blowin the temple and he fell dead without a sound or bloodAh I see exclaimed LampkinThen went on Hendricks Kolafeared as he was seen to enter Caruthers rooms that he would be suspected so he quickly resorted to the excellent scheme of making it appearthat his victim had suddenly left thecityHe first crowded Caruthers bodyinto one of his big trunks and deliberately went down to the street and employed a passing baggageman to comeup for the trunk pretending that itwas his Without attracting noticehe got the trunk delivered at his ownrooms in town and early the next morning bad it removed out here by his Indian servant He next dropped Caruthers valet a note from Philadelphiawhich was mailed in that city by aneastern confederate and later heforced another communication to MisHuntingtonBut in the meantime he was thinking of some unique means of totallydestroying the body He ended by cutting it up and reducing it to ashes bypxj hydrogen flame all except thehand which for a time escaped hisnotice He was about to throw theashes away when he ran across thehand Then the thought occurred tohim that unless it was proved beyonddoubt that Caruthers was actuallydead there would be endless litigationbefore Miss Huntington could comeinto her uncles estate As you knowthat would not have suited Kola so heput the ashes and hand in the vase andmanaged to get them into Caruthersapartments His first idea was that itwould be taken for the work of a crankhence his cranky letter to me Hisnext inspiration was to hypnotize Gielow and make him confess and flee butfor a week the artist persistently avoided him and it was not till Kola discovered that I was back from Boston thathe accidentally met the artist and accomplished his purposeBut why did Kola make the first attempt on your life asked the doctorBecause he had already decided tomurder Caruthers marry the heiressand continue his role of Italiancount in New York and wasafraid thatI would sooner or later recognize himBut the second attempt on yourlife questioned LampkinWas because he found out that I wasat the rooms of Count Bantinni themorning after Gielows apparent flightand was afraid I would finally discoverhis disguise I think from the fact thathe avoided me during that time thathe was afraid of me but after he playedthe Bible trick on us I think he believed he could frighten me out of following up the Bantinni clew and into abelief in the guilt of Gielow Howeverhis fears got the best of him and hedecided to kill both you and me bymeans of his dead fallJust then there was the sound of agong down the road and the patrolwagon dashed into viewThe ambulance will follow prettysoon remarked Hendricks Doctor Iam going to leave you and Miss Huntingtou with the pa tient while Denhamand I go in with our bootyThat will be all right answeredLampkin Well look after himDenham and Hendricks had led Kolaout to the wagon and put him in andHendricks was about to climb in afterhim when Dr Lampkin came to thedoor and signaled to Hendricks to comebackMiss Huntington wants to see youbefore you go he saidA sheepish expression was mingledwith the flush on Hendricks face ashe entered the room where Gielow layawake and smiling contentedly MissHuntington rose from the bedside andheld out her handI couldnt let you go without speaking to you she said her eyes fillingI shall never forget your goodness aslong as I live You are the best friendI ever had Arthur she said turningto Gielow I cannot say what I wantto say I am going to kiss him Andshe put her arms around the neck ofthe detective and kissed him on thelipsHendricks grew very red in the faceand saying something about wishinghe had it all to do over again he backedfrom the room As ne turned at thethreshold he stumbled over a rug andalmost fell into Lampkins armsThe doctor braced him up with ahand on each of his shoulders andgrinned and smacked has lips significantly But Hendricks only swore athim waxed redder in the face and descended to the wagon and crawled inbeside KolaTHE ENDNICE PRESENT FOR A BRIDEFormer Sweetheart of fhnrllcaCiave Her a Pillow StnCeil withHis Pretty CarlsBoth of the girls had been unfortunate enough to fall

That the Magnetic NeealeMay Be Rendered Practically TJeIeM to the Mariner and the SurveyorA Curiow DiscoveryAlthough the invention and introduction of the trolley system of street railways have been of inestimable valne tooivilization it has incidentally wroughtsome harm here and there Emphasiswas laid on one of these drawbacks toelectric traction in the address deliveredby Professor A W Bucker at a recentmeeting of the British Association Forthe Advancement of ScienceIn various parts of the world observatories have been established for the parpose of keeping track of the changes inthe direction in which the magneticneedle points It was long ago discovered not only that the compass does notaim directly at the north pole but thatthe amount of variation in its indications from true north undergoes slowalterations Hence it is necessary tomako fresh charts showing the variation for different parts of the globeevery few years But in order to getthe data for such corrections of thehighest importance to the surveyor andmariner it is reqmisite that careful observations be made continuously at anumber of widely separated pointsTwo of the most famous and hithertouseful institutions of this class are situated in Washington in the grounds ofthe naval observatory and in TorontoThe interference of the electric currentsthat run through the earth and thetrack of trolley lines which have beenconstructed near these observatories interfere so much with the behavior ofthe instruments of both places that therecords now obtained are practicallyworthless And the experts are greatlypuzzled by the problem of escaping fromthis vexatious interruption of theirworkSo delicate are the influences whichthe magnets in such an observatory areintended to investigate that they can

deposit their jaokkniveskeys and all other metallic objects abouttheir persons before entering the apartment The magnets generally bars ofsteel not over eix inches long are poisedabove a scale that is graduated to themost minute fractions and a telescopeon an adjacent pillar is used to readthe fluctuations which are too small tobe discernible by the unassisted eye Atiny mirror as big as a dime catches abeam of light more slender than thelead in a pencil and reflects it away toa sheet of slowly moving photographicpaper on whioh a permanent reoord ismade The arrangement of the apparatusis such that the movement of the magnet is magnified many times in the reoord in order to render the changes perceptibleThere are three sets of instrumentson duty in such an observatory Oneswings

spite of the delicacy of the apparatus it may seem surprising to the laymind that the passage of trolley currents at a distance of many rods fromthe observatory should be able to affectthe instruments

already succumbed PotsdamPare St Maur Greenwich and Kew arebesieged and the issue largely dependsupon whether these great national observatories can or cannot make goodtheir defense tAlthough the practical service tomankind which is rendered by institutions of this class is alone sufficient tojustify their maintenance and to warrant alarm as to their future there areother questions involved which possessprofound interest for the philosopherWe know that the earth is a magnetbut as yet no one is able to say whatmakes it so The fundamental secret ofterrestrial magnetism has not beensolved Then too there are variouschanges in direction which mark thebehavior of the needle that remain tobe explained What influence is it thatmakes the needle swing to and fro to amicroscopic extent every day Why is itthat the diurnal swing is greater inyears of sun spot abnudauee than at theminimum stage of solar activity Whydo the indications of the needle differin summer from those of winter Whatis
