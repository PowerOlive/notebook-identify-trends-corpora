Several large Eastern manufacturers, anticipating a
record-breaking holiday trade, stocked heavily so as to
take care of 4 'hurry orders." The unseasonable weather
and the lack of snow in December, throughout the entire
country, affected the Shoe industry more than other lines,
and "hurry orders" were few and far between. Our
buyers, always on the spot, finally induced them, owing
to our immense outlet, to consign these goods to Dan
Cohen to be converted into ready money.

The February Woman's Home
Companion.
The February Woman's Home Com
panion contains a remarkable snort
story entitled "The Way;" by Julie
Wilbor Tompkins. It is a story that
has. aroused a tremendous discussion
over the question as to how much of a
sacrifice one woman could or would
have the right to make for her friend
who is in trouble.
In the same number there are sever
al articles worthy of special comment.
One entitled "The Open Market in
Des Moines," is a report of a move
ment in Iowa which has already re
duced the cost of living in several
cities and towns of that state and
seems to offer a suggestion to many
other communities. It is an article of
universal importance. Another valu
able article in the February Com
panion is one entitled "The Girl With
a Voice," in which a professional
opera singer gives a graphic account
of the long road that young women
must travel who seek a musical career.
It is an article filled with facts about
actual cases. Other interesting articles
in the number are: "The Little Prin
cess," a character sketch of the only
daughter of the Emperor of German :
The Lost Aphrodite or Jimdos;
"Outdoor Photographs at Night;"
"Sweethearts and Wives:" "The
Healthy Babj," and 'a sermon by
Charles E. Jefferson, pastor of the
Broadway Tabneracle in New York
City.
The dressmaking and housekeeping
departments are as usual filled with
interesting facts and practical sug-
g-cstons. Grace M. Gould, who con
Gucts the fashion department, con
tributes an article this month entitled
"What Men Are Wearing."
Clay Offers Another Bill.
Hon. Sidney G. Clay in tle House
yesterday offered a bill to submit to
the people an amendment to section
201 of the. Constitution, providing that
one railroad company may purchase
the line of another, where such line
purchased is less than 100 miles in
length
This bill would cure the trouble the
L. & N. Railroad Company is having
with the operation of the line from
Frankfort to Patris.

by wild beasts don't approach the

jNo Place for Culture of Tobacco.
! That Kentucky soil is best fitted for
i the culture of tobacco and that it
rank second to no place, in the United
States as a State where the weed can
be produced at a profit by the grow
, ers, is evidenced by the statement of
Mr. R. A. McVey.who has just return
ed from Missouri, where a few years
' ago, following the movement to cut
( ut the tohacco crop f..r a season to
bac:o;growers in large numbers moved
from this county for the purpose of
' establishing- themselves in that State
1 to raise tobacco.
i The trlowintr accounts of the advan
tages offered by the Missouri tobacco
belt, according to Mr. McVey, have
been the means of inducing the gtow
I ers. to seek the new fields, and risk
j their interests in the Eldorado of to
I bacco interests, but to the man they
j are deep in the regret that they made
I the venture' and many would be glad
! to return to Kentucky.
Several years ago Mr. McVey, who !
had been doing well in the culture of
I tobacco in this county, was induced by i
the accounts of the superior prospects
i htld out by the Missouri tobacco belt ;
to sell his interests here'and move into
the new field. He raised several crops I
of tobacco on a farm which he had i
i purchased near Weston, Mo., but as a :
result of his efforts, found himself to !
Woodpecker's Hearing.
It is not easy to explain Avhy wood
peckers select one tree rather than
others of. the same kind in the for
est upon which to begin their opera
tions, or why they attack one side of a
tree and leave the other untouched.
Commonly it will be found, no doubt,
that worms or ants are concealed be
neath the point selected and that the
woodpecker is guided in his search by
the sense of hearing.
Ground Broken for New Depot.
Ground was broken this week for
the new L & N. passenger depot in
Carlisle. The structrue will cost in
the neighborhood of $15,000. Messrs.
Bappert & George, the local brick con
tractors, have the contract for the
brick work and the firm of January &
Connell will furnish the roofing. As
soun as the foundation is completed
the contractors will begin work.
Big Tobacco Deal.
One of the largest deals of leaf
tcbacco in the Louisville market was
consummated Monday when the Louis
ville Tobacco Warehouse Company sold
B. J. O'Brien & Co., 5,000,000 pounds
of dark tobacco for export mostly to
England. The weed, for which ap
proximately 400,000 was paid, is of
unfired type from Warren, Barren and
adjoining territory, and is this year's
leaf. During the latter part of Decem
ber Mr. O'Brien closed a large con
tract to supply the French Government
with Kentucky tobacco, and part will
go to that country.
The Paper Wedding.
The "paper wedding" marks the
completion of the second year of
married life, and is sometimes the
first one celebrated, since the cotton
anniversary seems to offer very few
possibilities in the way of unique en
tertainment. For the paper wedding
we can decorate our rooms and table
with some of the beautiful paper
flowers that are now being modeled
most exquisitely after the natural
flowers. Harper's Bazar.

Raid Gambling Resort.
The Georgetown police Sunday night
raided a gambling resort in the Lan
caster Hotel. Fifty-one men and boys
were taken in the raid. A young man
who lost a considerable sum of money
in the place was refused a loan by one
of the proprietors and he gave the tip
to the officers. Aside from the number
captured the police have the names of
twenty others who have participated
in the game. Thirty-one of the young
men appeared in court Tuesday morn
ing, pleaded guilty and were fined $20
each.
W. O. Miller and his son, Bert Mill
er, were held over to the grand jury
under $500 bond for running a game jf

Claude Hudson and Ed Henry was dis
