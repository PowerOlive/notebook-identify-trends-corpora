the Mine WorkersUnions is ConfidentThat the West Virginia Minors Will Jointiro Strike All They Wait for is aLittle Urging From the UnionIiabor Leaders Among ThemCleveland O July 14 Within 48hours developments of a very definitecharacter are expected to take placein the West Virginia coal fields Aleading operator received a long1 distance telephone message at ten oclockTuesday morning stating that nine organizers had just left Pittsburgh forthe West Virginia coal fields A -personwho occupies a high official position in tho Mine Workers union wasat the Pittsburgh end of the phoneYou may look for something start-liner in that direction within the next48 hours he said reliable adviceswhich I have received Tuesday morning convince me the West Virginiaminers will come out All they waitfor is a little urging from the union Iam free to confess to you that while Iexpect many men would -come out Inever hoped for such a complete andoverwhelming victory as thisThe foregoing message was repeatedto a reporter who was standing athand by the operator who received itWhen that point is reached that thecoal mine operators refuse to talk forpublication the situation is grave indeed The operators now urge upontheir interviewers that under no circumstances must their names be usedin connection with the informationthey have supplied A leading operator made a plain statement astartling statement in fact Tuesdaymorning but insisted his name mustnot be usedIs there not some parts of yourstatement which I may accredit toyou asked the reporterNo You see if I talked for publication I would have to say to you justthe opposite of what I have said Youappreciate that there are many reasonswhy I would not want my name to appear as admitting all these factsSince Saturday the coal strike hasassumed a very grave aspect but a fullrealization of the change did notreach- Cleveland operators and dealersuntil Tuesday Excepting a few operators who had some inside information they were disposed to speak lightly of the matter and loudly declaredthat there was coal on handmore than enough to supply thecountry regardless of the outcomeof the strike Tuesday all this seeming or pretended confidence haddisappeared Several operators wentto Pittsburgh Monday to attend thevoluntary conference of the state arbitrators One of these whose knowledge of the premises is above questionsaid Tuesday The situation is verygrave and I anticipate some very startling developments within the next 48hours I believe the West Virginiaminers will come out and thatwill make the tie up practicallycomplete for the strikers willthen concentrate all their effortson the Dearmitts men A smallamount of coal is now coming from themines along the Pennsylvania mainline and from the coke regions but it5s in comparatively insignificant quantities I think it will be shut off entirely very soon From what I couldlearn Monday at Pittsburgh I do nothesitate to say that in my belief therailroads will hesitate to haul WestVirginia and Dearmitts mines coalThe engineers and trainmen are regarding the situation with loweringbrows P M Arthurs statement to thecontrary notwithstandingMr J J Phillips a coal operatorreceived the following telegram fromFlemington W Va Tuesday afternoon Miners all went out on a strikethis morningPittsburgh Pa July 14 There isa bare possibility that the joint arbitration conference may yet lead to thetermination of the miners strike onthe basis of the true uniformityagreement proposed by PresidentDearmit of the New York and Cleveland Gas Co last year but which failed for the reason that the 97 per centof the operators in this districtrequired by Dearmit could not besecured Two sessions of thearbitration board were heldTuesday representatives from thestates of Pennsylvania Ohio WestVirginia Indiana and Illinois beingpresent At the afternoon sessionPresident Dearmit appeared before theboard and told of the conditions whichexist from his point of view He recited the history of the miners struggles for better conditions He told ofthe great uniformity movement in1S95 96 which failed of its purposeMr Dearmit saidIf the operators of the Pittsburghdistrict wiLl abolish their companystores use a uniform screen give honest weight 2000 pounds of coal for aton pay cash every two weeks I willleave it to any committee to settle theprice of mining and pay it no matterhow high providing all my competitorspay the same price Unless these conditioni can be brought about I will notagree to abolish the contract with mymen nor can I afford to do soThe board will meet Dearmit againWednesday and will endeavor to getthe operators together for the purposeof inducing them to make another attempt to secure true uniformity asoutlined by the former at TuesdaysconferenceFell Down an Air ShaftNew York July 14 Mrs EmilyGriswold 40 years of age fell down anair shaft of the Hotel Castle Tuesdayand it is feared sustained internal injuries of a

Senator Fry Senator Lodgenor Senator Gray members of thecommittee were at -the capitol Tuesday It is not the present expectationthat the treaty of annexationwillbetaken up at this session but a situation exists which may hasten the matter It is believed that if the attitudeof Japan toward Hawaii becomes morethreatening it will force annexation atonce though theiriends of annexationwill not bs in haste unless developments render speedy action necessaryThe house took a recess Tuesday until Wednesday at noon without transacting any business Mr Cannon thechairman of the appropriation

carried Thehouse was in session but three minutesWashington July 14 The representatives of the two houses of congress in the conference on the tariffbill spent a busy day devoted for themost part to work in the conferenceroom There were occasional consultations with other senators or membersof the house upon points at issue bulthese were brief so that comparatively little information as to the progressmade found its way to outsiders 11is known that almost the entire daywas devoted to the sugar and woolschedules and the best informationobtainable is that a final agreementwas not reached upon

afternoonthe senate and house conferes separated the house men repairing to theways and means committee room Itwas generally believed that this actionon the part of the house men was forthe purpose of deciding upon a line ofpolicy on sugar but they declined tpgive out any informationContrary to published reports it ispositively asserted thafethe arngarschedule has not been agreed upon andin fact that all the big questions before the conference which have seemingly been settled are only tentativelyagreed to one side or the other insisting that they shall be held operiNothing will be finally closed so faras the matters of importance are concerned until all have been decided upon and the conferees are ready to cometo a complete agreementIt is believed that the wool schedulewhich occupied the attention of theconferees more or less Monday andTuesday can now be settled whenever other matters have reached astage for final adjustment The senate conferees are ready to compromisethe differences on first and secondclass wools by making them bothdutiable at 11 cents and a compromiseon third class wools has beensuggested by house members of theconference concerning which they express the hope that it will be satisfactory to both the wool growers and thecarpet manufacturers but this is notassured This compromise propositionlooks to fixing a rate of 3 cents a poundon all

from us as your Uncle GranvilledidGranville Thorndyke had died ofquick consumption when his nephewwas a boy of 12 and Philip had a veryvivid recollection of the strong manssteeple chase down the road to emaciation and death It seemed incrediblethat such a thing could happen to himHe sat down and tried to realize itRealizing is usually a methodicalprocess but when a man believes helias just heard his death sentence pronounced it is apt to be different Thorndykes mind skipped the intermdiatesteps and arrived at the end of thingswith a shock that jarred him out oT hisusual habit of indifferenceFor Gods sake doctor Do youknow but of course you dont no mancaneally put himself in anothersplaceVvvnenit conies1 tbsthe1pinchu - -Not wholly perhaps and yet I cantell you it isnt pleasant to be a prophetof evil Hadnt you any hint of yourdangerNot the least in the world WhyIm here now only because the motherand Helen insisted upon my comingAnd I cant take it in yet Im not

thedisease and then as you remember hedied within the yearYesJL know all about it- assentedthe young man moodily ami now Iknow why mother was so anxiousHe got up and walked nervously backand forth in front of the physicianwith his hands behind him and his headdown If anybody had told me I wassuch a coward I shouldnt have believed it doctor This thing has comeso suddenly that Im all at sea Whatis there to be done oris there anythingto be doneThe phjsician shook his head Taking it for granted that you want theplain fact Im afraid the chances areagainst you Sometimes a completechange of scene climate and habit willwork the miracle that would seem to benecessary in a case like yours but it isonly fair to warn you that such an experiment might only shorten your lifeA sort of forlorn hope rejoinedThorndyke Nevertheless I think Illtry it not so much on my own accountas because Doctor where should I goand how long a time can I count onAnswering your last question firstI dont know no one can say positively but unless you get help almost immediately the disease is likely to develop very rapidly I should say thatsix months would tell the story oneway or the other though it might takelonger And as to the place there isntmuch choice so long as you get an eventemperature and pleasant surroundings I have considerable faith in theclimate of the southern end of the BlueEidge but you must live out of doorsif you go thereSix months something less than 200days That ought to give a man timeenough to make his peace many a poordevil gets less than that many minutesor seconds And yet there are somethings that cant well be settled in ashort half yearYou are thinking of your engagement to HelenYes that and the property andmy mothers grief and worry and ahundred other things that were not ofthe least consequence an hour agoHe took his hat and paused in the doorway Doctor I wish you wouldntsay anything about this at least notjust yet Dont tell the mother orHelen I meanGertainly notThank you Ill see you againore I go that is if it seems worth whileto make the experimentAn hour earlier in the day Thilip4fThorndyke had sauntered into the vestibule of the great office building withthe thought that a visit to Jr Perevinwould answer the double purpose of relieving his mothers anxiety and ofenabling him to wear out a half hour ofthe afternoon in a chat with the oldfamily physician and he went the morewillingly since the half hours had oflate taken to dragging rather discouragingly especially in the afternoonsThat they dragged was due to a numberof causes the chief of which iwas thatThorndyke was an unsuccessful idlerHis father had been a hard-workingattorney gathering and leaving an estate which would havebeen a fortune elsewhere than inNew York and which was a competence even in that city of millionaires The will gave Philip halfand the irksomeness of its possessionhad not made itself f el t until after hispost graduate course in the law hadleft him a squire of dames and lacking the spur of necessity which mighthave made him successful in his profession Up to the moment when hestood waiting for the next ascending elevator which should lift him tothe altitude of Dr Perevins chambershis life had been as uneventful as hisL mothers solicitude could make itThere had been no invigorating heightsto scale and no nerve trying depths toexplore In his college course and inthe choice of a profession he had followed in the footsteps of his father taking the one and choosing the other forno better reason than that both wereselected for him by his parents Summedup the young man who waited for theelevator was a very fair example ofthe neutralizing effect of prearrangement in domestic affairs a logicalproduct of a cut-and-dried system ofhome training which makes no allowance for individual needs in the subjectAnd if Thorndyke had been given novoice in the matter of his bringingup he had had quite as little to sayabout his engagement to Helen Morrisson She was the only daughter ofhis fathers law partner and the alliance of the two families in the personsof their respective heirs was a treatywhich had been discussed ratified engrossed docketed and filed among thepartnership archives long before thepersons most nearly concerned were oldenough to be consulted Contrary to allprecedent the young people made nodifficulties On the part of the younggirl the loyal friendship of childhoodhad grown with her stature into a veryreal and earnest love for the man whowas her betrothed And if Philips acceptance of the part assigned to himwas not sufficiently demonstrative toplease his mother it was due quite asmuch to the fact that the two hadgrown up together as to any undefinedinclination on the part of the young manto rebel against the conditions whichhad forestalled the growth of his individuality In a tranquil and dispassionate way Philip was devoted to theyoung woman of his mothers choicebutJris Jove for Helen was rather theoutgrowth of an obedient sense of thefitness of things urged on by a justappreciation of Helens beauty andgoodness than the spontaneous andcompelling passion which is no moreamenable to reason than it is subordinate to a sense of dutyFrom passive indifference to activediscontent is bat a step in life fromwhich the objects of legitimate ambition had been removed The dead levelof an existence in which the trivialitiesof the daily social round are the cnljmile stones stretches away before theweary pilgrim into a limitless and aridregion whose sandy wastes forbid thegrowth of any sturdy tree of effortThorndyke had been journeyingthrough some such desert of boredomon the day of his visit to Dr Perevinand one of the vagrant thoughts whichfollowed him to the doctors doorturned upon the well worn questionas to whether after all life were really worth the effort The answer wasdeferred but the suggestion was distinctly negative An hour later whenhe stood before the latticed door of thesame elevator waiting to be shot downto the level of the street the point ofview had veered so suddenly as to leavehim gasping like an exhausted swimmerunder whose feet there had lately beenthe decks of the stanchest of vesselsFor the first time in his experiencewith elevators the swift rush down theshaft made him dizzy and he had tosit down at the cigar stand in the vestibule a minute before going out intothe street A line of periodicals -aspinned to a string in front of the cigarvenders counter and Philip saw theword Allacoochee in staring capitalson the title page of one of them Heb6ught a copy of the paper and readthe advertisementALLACOOCHEEThe Future Commercial and IndustrialCapital of the New South The most Equable climate in Alabama Fine NaturalMedicinal Springs Charming and Picturesque Scenery Inexhaustible Beds of Coaland Iron A Limitless Field for ImprovementA carefully prepared prospectus of Allacoochee may be found at the banking housebf Messrs Tompkyns Hyder where thesubscription books of the Allacoochee LndManufacturing Improvement companywill be opened for the sale of a limited number of shares on the 5th instAn acquaintance looked over hisshoulder as he read Hello Thorndyke he said going south to make afortunePhilip folded the paper and put itinto his pocket I hadnt thoughtmuch about making the fortune butperhaps I shall go south for awhileDo you know anything about thisplaceNothing more than the scare adtells but I fancy its another bait forgudgeons I shouldnt put any moneyinto it if I were youI had no intention of doing soThey had reached the street andPhilip shook hands with his friend before turning to cross the square to theelevated stationGood by old man I may be off before I see you again said Philip andthe faintness cam back with theathought tmyt he should probably neversee the man again and Shis was thefirst of a series of leave takings whichshould be for all timeIIILEAVE TAKINGSPhilip was reading the evening paperwhen Mrs Thorndyke came into thelibrary before dinner and he made acommendable effort to appear naturalwhen he greeted her The hope that shewould give him time to lead up gradually to the subject of his interviewwith Dr Perevin had scarcely takenshape when her first question Hung himinto the midst oi itDid jou go to see the doctor to dayPhil she asked moving the readinglamp that its ligh might serve himbetterWhat doctor oh you mean Perevin Yes I went down and told him Iwas a very sick man in your opinionWhat does he say is the matter withyouWith me why he said you coddledme too much or something of thatsort that Id better break away and golive in the woodsBut seriously Philip you know howwe are worried about you Doesnt hethink youre in dangerDanger of what Philip threwclown his paper and stood up beforeher Do I look like a sick man Canjou stretch imagination to the point offancying me going into a declineHis manner was reassuring enoughbut the subtle intuition of maternallove is not to be hoodwinked b3r appearances Mrs Thorndyke was not satisfied and seeing there was no possibility of keeping her away from theIreaded subject Philip skillfully introduced his plan of migrationWiry of course she said I dontsee why we hadnt thought of that before We can find some quiet placedown south where we can be comfortable and we can take Helen with usPhilips heart smote him when he sethimself to demolish this cheerful planHaving had time to think about it hehad demonstrated to his own satisfaction the uselessness of trying to dodgehis fate He had succeeded in twistingDr Perevins warning into a formalsentence of death and he had made uphis mind to take the physicians advice not for recuperative purposes butfor reasons which were purely sentimen tal He would go away into the wilderness where he could find a quietplace to die and would so save his mother and Helen the day-to-day sorrow ofthe intermediary period It was allvery foolish and boyish doubtless butPhilip was only an overgrown boy atbest so far as individuality was concerned and Mrs Thorndyke had herself to thank for it And so he proceeded to put his theory into practiceThat would all be very pleasant butdont jou see that I must go alone if Imean to live out of doors and rough itIm not sure but it would be better forme to go into the woods with the turpentine gatherers or in a logging campI dont know that especially yearn forsuchan experience but Pd do thatoranything else to please you and HelenDont be impatient Philip dear Iknow were a pair of foolish womenbut there is always the look of youruncle Granville in your eyes andMrs Thorndyke sat down and began tocry softly into her handkerchiefPhilip was beside her in a momentThere there little mother youve letthis thing worry you till youre all unstrung You mustnt you know Perevin says that Im that all I need is achange of climate You wont know mewheal I get backWhen one is habitually truthful thelips lie clumsily and the face usually reftThere there little motherfuses to corroborate the falsehood itwas therefore fortunate for Philipsplan that his mothers emotion prevented her from seeing the untruthAnd see now how great a matter sosmall a thing may turn aside If MrsThorndyke had looked up she wouldhave believed Philips face against hiswords and there would have been nosolitary migration and no case inequity no moral upheaval and nostrangling of a carefully educated conscience And besides Philip mighthave died comfortably at home with allthe accessories of civilization to makeit easierPreparations for the journey and thearranging of matters connected withthe estate kept Philip so busy for thenext few days that there was no timeto indulge in painful rehearsals of theapproaching leavetakings As a confidant in the business affair was necessary he told his solicitor not the exacttruth but what he had made himselfbelieve to be the truth and was thusenabled to keep his mother in ignoranceof his careful provision

overTHEone anothers shoulders andwatched Georgia Blount at her playBald Top Crabs Claw and Old Surlyv stood nearest sometimes they seemedso near that Georgia could talk tothem and when a low-hanging- cloudshut them out of sight or the blue autumn haze veiled them softly and heldthem aloof from her she felt as otherchildren feel when their friends turnaway or refuse to tell what the thoughtsare in their eyes- A gnarled tree grew atHhe foot of- the bluff which lifted the big dome ofCopper Head above the mountain sideand between the roots of this treeGeorgia had her play house Day inand day out no one ever came in Sightof it except the mountains but Georgiawas never lonely In the mornings shehad to take all her dolls out of theirbeds of moss and dress them in freshgowns of summer or autumn leaves orin stiff fringy costumes of pine needlesShe was very much in earnest about herdolls and yet she sometimes clapped herhands and laughed when they weredressed and leaning in a long rowagainst one of the roots they made suchan elfin company Some of them hadnuts for heads and some of them hadacorns Some of them had been madeout of dry rounded receptacles of acomposite flower from which the floretshad fallen and the winged seeds flownaway leaving only the circle of bractsfor a collar and a brittle stem with twobranches from which the flower endshad been nipped off for arms Thesewere the most fragile of Georgias children and it took a most skillful handto keep their toilets without snappingtheir necks or their bodies or theirlimbs Georgia could do it for sheioved them and she had been dressingthem ever since she was big enough to11 wander off by herself up the mountainside and through the forest which separated the home clearing from the rugged bowlder strewn slope below theplay house tree and the rock walls ofthe domeGeorgia was much bigger now thanwhen she had begun to fashion dollsfor herself with chubby awkward fingers she was so much bigger indeedthat she was 14 years old she mighthave thought that she was growing upif there had been anyone to suggest itto her but she had seen no other children growing up and the mountainsdid not tell her for they themselvesliad taken so long to grow that it neveroccurred to them that she would notcontinue to be a little girl for centuriesand centuries to come She had workto do at home now and that was an interruption yet every day before orafter work she managed to slip off to-ward the forest path- Among her dolls there was one madeDi corncob and far larger than theothers and this one Georgia dressed asa man He was a very wicked lookingiloll having deep black eyes and noseund mouth which she had burned intohis head with a hot iron nail and it wasbecause he was so different from therest that she had named him the f ureigner after the way of southernmountain people in speaking of anystranger who comes amongthem Thefureigner Ihed in a corner all by himself at the back of the tree and Georgiaalways knew that when he came outamong the others there was mischiefbrewing Sometimes she walked slowlyaway from the tree gathering leaves andgrasses as she went and then as soonas she could slrp away from herselfhurried stealthily back pulled the foreigner out of his corner dropped himamong the other dolls and ran to herleaf gathering again so that she mightbe surprised when she finally returnedand found how he had been rompingap and down among her mountain people Oh happy kingdom she alwayscried when she caught sight of him hehave come agin and oh how he do havebeen a layin waste the landOne day as she stood with her handsheld up in horror at a row of mountainpeople who had fallen prostrate roundthe savage foreigner a real strangercame out from the thick forest andstood at the edge of the natural opening around the play house tree Hesaw her at once bare footed redjlheeked with her figured bandanaknotted at her throat and he couldhear her speak but she who shouldhave been as quick eared as a rabbitbein just as shy was too intent to notice the stirring of his feet in thesparse dry autumn grassFolkses folkses she cried outwes obleeged to run him off themounting Hes a fureigner an heaint got no right hyar Wes obleegedto run him off the mountingThe man who listened drew a littlecloser trying not to make a noise Heknew that he himself was a fureigner and he wanted to hear whatever thegirl might say but he laughed rightout when he saw that she was pointingat a corn cob doll Georgia jumpedgave a single glance over her shoulderand ran It was one thing to planraidson an intruder whom she had droppedv into the playhouse behind her own- back but this this was another thingOnly a little way from the tree therewas a crevice in the bluff which rose behind it Georgia knew that it woundfor a long way between a detached rock- tutu the main bluff and she slipped intoit-Af he stopped a moment to wonder if shehad been cowardly to leave hertain people to the two foreigners andto listen ii anything was going onWhat she heard was the stranger talkingNow if I were you he said Ishould just go back where I came fromand not disturb a respectable community like this Georgia peeped roundthe edge of the rock He had picked herforeigner up and was smiling into hisevil ejes So you wont tell me -whereyou came from he said Oh wellthen I dont like to but Ill have tobuild- a prison and put you into it Hetook his hat off and put it over thecorn cob foreigner If I see you trying to walk off with that calaboosewhile Im building the jail he wenton threateningly Ill just inform youthat your name is Dennis young manfrom that time onThe sun which had been an impartial witness of this arrest beat downamiably upon the little mountain people with their queer natural faces uponthe calaboose and upon a close croppedblack head bent to the building of a jailfrom jagged bits of stone And- it fellon Georgias eager face and figure forbit by bit she had come quite outsideof the shadowed crevice so that shemight miss nothing that this strangeman did and said But he did not lookher way he was too busy building uphis jailMost disgraceful thing I ever heardof he declared nodding toward thecaptive under the hat You call yourself a foreigner doll 3b you Dont youknow that up where the foreignerscome from the dolls have long curlyhair and eyes that open and shut andred mouths and pink cheeks and armsand legs that bend just as well as minedo and they wear fine stockings andshoes and some of them walk about andsay mam ma pa pa and their clothesGeorgias breath was coming fasther lips were parted

She cameup to where he was building And I-never seed a man playin with dollsafore either she added Doesntyou uns have no work ter doThe man had taken off a box and abundle of queer looking sticks whichhad been slung from his shoulder Nowhe left the jail and began unfasteningthe box Perhaps youll think my worka good deal the same as doll play hesaid He took two or three boards -withjrictures on them from the box andleaned them up against the tree-Oh h breathed GeorgiaThose are the dolls I make he saidBut thats thelivin face of JacksonBarker she cried pointing to one ofthem Do ter ha madehit ter look like thatYes he answeredI whist youd tell me howThe artist smiled Its just by trjing a good deal as it is with you inmaking dolls he explainedShe bent up close and looked at theboard with its bit of canvas tacked onit Then she turned a puzzled face toward him But this hyars flat shesaid an yet it looks like it was standin but I couldnt do that I couldntnoways make a doll oufn a flat piece

his hat gingerly with hisfinger and thumb and he and Georgiaboth laughed as they saw the helplessway in which the corncob doll glaredup into the sunlight Georgia set himup against a tree in the severely uprightposition which his construction demanded and then stood by the strangers elbow watching His bunch ofbrushes the shining tubes from whichhe squeezed dabs of color on to hispalette the jointed easel which he puttogether and set up so quickly and thecamp stool on which he seated himselfwere all fascinating accessories to themaking of dolls either flat or roundand she forgot to be afraid The artistglanced at the corn shuck clothing ofthe foreigner and matched it with amixture of paint which he blendedback and forth with a brush while heasked Georgia questions about thepeople -on the mountain When he began to paint she drew closer and closeruntil she was leaning at his very elbowSuddenly she caught her breathHappy kingdom she murmuredyou begun it flat an now youve madehim

Ill paint another and paint itslower he said and then perhapsyoull see and stooping he picked upthe gayest of her dolls It was dressedin dark red oak leaves slashed withsumac and its head was a hickory nuton which she had traced features withthe faint red juice of a berryIll try to keep a pearter watchshe said gravely as the young mantouched the oak leaf dress upon thecanvas In spite of his promise he wastempted to work so fast that for a second time she would miss seeing himdo it but he was afraid that she wouldrun away and so he began explainingto her how the form began to standout

doll I ever sawand he began to work Georgia couldnot watch the picture of her own faceas it stood swiftly out from the freshcanvas on the easel but her eyes greweach moment softer and brighter andmore bewildering to paint asthey saw another picture allin words unfold against thebackground of the forest The shadows lengthened on the mountains giving them the look of listening too forthe3r had seen no dolls but Georgias inall their years Georgia was used tomarking the hours by the mountainsas if they were great dials which hadbeen placed in sight so that her motherwould not need to scold her for cominghome too late and yet she did not notice how the purple twilight spreadfrom the ravines and rose from slopeto slope The lowest spur of CrabsClaw sank beneath it and that meantthat it was time for putting all her dollsto bed but she was turning back thecoverlet of a real dolls bed far in thenorth The whole of Crabs Claw sankbeneath the golden level of the sunbeams and she should have startedhome but she was where a myriadglistening lights were making all themarvelous world as white as day andgroups of people lingered by great windows full of toys The sunset lingeredon old Bald Top in the east just as apatient comrade lingers and calls againThe young man got up from his stooland stuck his brushes through hispalette just as Bald Top faded in shadow and only Old Surly lifted its f rowning head into the whole glory of thewest He had put the last touch onhis picture and he walked away andlooked at it with a contented sighGeorgia sprang to her feet andwentaround to see She was a little numbfrom sitting still so long Happykingdom but hits just like looking inter the spring er the water bucketshe cried nervously Im right muchbetter favored than the fureigner sheadded glancing down where he hadbeen dropped and forgotten at the sideof the tree It seemed unreal to comeback into her little homemade worldafter all that she had seen Even hermountain people as they stared up

stranger was tramping off into the woodsbut the twilight was no longer lonely now She stood with clasped handswatching until the trees and the dimness shut him out of sight The sunset colors lingered

all partsDf the world It is without syntax andis largely inarticulate but for all thaatIt plays a very important part in theservice of humanity It gains additional interest from the fact that

member of the British house ofcommons discusses a question whichwould have immediate and very seriousinterest for this country if the European war that is always to be regarded as a possibility should actuallyoccur It has already been proposed onthe continent that in case of war foodbe declared contraband The primaryeffect of this would be to place GreatBritain at a tremendous disadvantageif she were one of the parties to thecontest That country now importsfood to the value of about 750000000a year Of wheat and flour alone it imports 23000000 quarters a year andproduces only 5000000 The stock onhand is never more than three monthssupply and sometimes no more thanone so that making food contrabandwould be quite likely to result in abread famine within a very moderatetimeOf the vast quantity of food importedthe United States furnishes about 200000000 worth If food shipped to GreatBritain were recognized by the contending powers as contraband of warour trade would suffer immensely Insurance of cargoes might easily riseto a point which would stop shipmentsOf the further effects it is unnecessaryto speculate at present but it is evident that the proposition to declarefood products contraband has a vitalinterest for us as very large shippersof such supplies Mr Seton Kerr theauthor of the North American articlesuggests that in no event would thiscountry join in recognizing the proposed addition to international law andin this he is doubtless correctFor Engjand the proposition is sothreatening that Mr Seton Kerr hasintroduced in the house of commons aresolution since adopted which declares the situation demands the serious attention of her majestys government Great Britain cannot consentto the proposed change nor can she prevent its adoption by the continentalpowers if the- choose to take such action which indeed will give them possible advantages great enough to account for the open support the plan hasreceived from some of them notablyFrance The gravity of the situationis further indicated by a propositionwhich is said to be favorably considered in England for creating there agovernment reserve of wheat sufficientto last at least six months Government authorities are believed to bethis project serious attention Ifit is undertaken there will be a largenew demand for American wheat Perhaps that is all that will come of itand this is greatly to be hoped Hartford CourantEARLY METAL WORKERSAntiquity of tlie Art EstnbHslied IyRecently Discovered InscriptionsThe earliest miners and metal workers of whom we have record were theAyran peoples of Euro Asian originwho though of pastoral and arborealhabits were familiar with the metalsand worked with them at least withthe metals gold silver and bronzeChaldeans and Assyrians as we nowknow from the cuneiform inscriptionswhich go back 3000 years B C wereundoubtedly expert in the use ofmetals while the Egyptians had an intimate knowledge of the arts andsciences In the brick and other inscriptions recently discovered artisansare seen at work with curious detailsof their methods and tools Pottersindeed had attained eminence in theirart and the Egyptians had certainly aknowledge of chemistry as the samples of their glass blowing and thostone pictures of tools forceps blowpipe etc prove Gold was largely usedat an early period between 4000 and5000 years B C as we find from somenewly discovered and ingenious weighing balances Many centuries olderthan the pyramids which date from 50to GO centuries back Ave have examples of engineering in Memphis whichcould not have been constructed without tools and necessarily an acquaintance with metals The word metalsis of Semitic origin the Hebrew wordmatals to forge indicates an earlyacquaintance with the fusing of oresand the malleability of nietalsTHow these early primitive people discovered the uses of things must ofcourse have been thi ough their wantsand needs particularly after they leftpastoral and tent
