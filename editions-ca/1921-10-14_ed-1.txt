Many of them are unnecessary, some are vexatious and someare even vicious.But it is the duty of every goodcitizen to obey the law so long as itis on the statute hooks. There isno other safe course.It is perfectly proper to insistthat a law is wrong, and to work forits repeal, hut it is never safe to violate any law.When we begin to violate one law,we create disrespect for all otherlaws, and when our laws fall intodisrepute our civilization ends.Ours is a government of lav. "Wecannot have government withoutlaws. Without this, life and property are not safe.It is therefore the duty of everycitizen to obey the law himself andto insist upon obedience to the lawby all others.A good citizen will iiot only obeythe law himself out he will assistin the enforcement of the law uponand for others."The melancholy days have come,The saddest of the year;A little too warm for whisky,A little too cold for beer."You old-timers of Paris, do youremember this little poem which thelate lamented John Wesley Hite usedto ornament the head of the TrueKentuckian's local column justabout this time of the year?Movie stars who assert that their"parties" are no worse than thoseof the "smart set" in society maybe conservative, but such testimonyif accepted as true is lamentablyweak as a defense.A certain young Paris man sayshis mother can always find out whathis father did when he stayed outuntil three a. m. She lets him tellall the things he did and then sheknows all the things he was afraidto mention.You must know where you are going. An ignorant person has no business to have self-reliance, as it mustbe well-founded; there must De asolid basis for it. To be be selfreliant will avail you nothing if youare incompetent.Of course, there are some thingshere in Paris that might be improved, and they sometimes cause us tobe vexed, but when we think of themany hundreds who have never hadthe pleasure of seeing Paris, one ofthe best cities in the Bluegrass, andwho have not had the chance to enjoy the luxuries of life here, wefeel consoled.These days it's a cinch to get outthinking. Newspapers, the movies,churches, magazines, public speakers. Almost every way you turnthere is some one waiting to relieveyou of the labor of thinking and present you with a well, ready-madeopinion. Don't take it.a sA Paris merchant claims that automobiles kill one-half more personsin a vear than the total number ofcasualties in all industries, including railroads. The low score inP.-jris fKv.1 is accounted for by thefact that pedestrians are graduallylearning to throw a wicked leap,and thus disappoint the auto driverwhen he thinks he is within easystriking distance of his prey.MOTHER!

It Js the nursery of the.Unest breed of horses the world has produced. An infusion of thoroughbred blood enriches every other strain and gives quality, speed andxjourage to the colder breeds. Hundreds of thousands of acres are devoted to the raising of thoroughbreds in tlii State, and millions of dollarsare invested "in the industry.At the coming session of the Legislature an organized effort will bemade to destroy the thoroughbred interest, lay waste the fertile pastures,now valued at from S500 to $1,000 an acre, upon which they graze and reduce the peerless Man O'War, for whom $500,000 has been refused, to theworth of a plow horse. '"Under the old book-making system which Mr. Bruce sought to per.petuate for his clents, the State did not receive a dollar; under the pres, ent law the Kentucky Jockey Club pays yearly into the Slate Treasury over$300,000. If Mr. Bruce succeeds in destroying the thoroughbred interestthis immense sum will be entirely lost to the State and the book-makerswin return to prey on the public.The leader of this destructive crusade, falsely put forth as a moral issue, is Helm Bruce, a Louisville lawyer, who, nursing a personal grievance,tend in grateful remembrance of his former nr?2 track clients, Cella, Tillesand Adler, the St. Louis bucket shop gambler!, seeks to prohibit all racing' iir Kentucky. When the Racing Commission was created by an act of theIjSsiature and the turf in this State was taken out of the hands of the;Tok-makers who had dishonored a royal sport. Helm Bruce, took a feejjQpom this syndicate of bucket shop owners and sought to have the law dedsxed unconstitutional. He was defeated in his selfish purpose and now- thtt the scandal breeding book-maker has been driven out, and the tuffis prospering under the pari-mutuel system, with the leading horsemen ofKentucky, selected by the Governor, giving their time to the enforcementof the law, Mr. Bruce seeks to destroy the entire turf structure and carrywith it the whole thoroughbred interests of Kentucky.Desha Breckenridge, editor of the Lexington Herald, has defendedjftcing, as now conducted under the State Commission, and in a series offrank and forceful editorials he has exposed the inconsistency of Helm"Bruce, once an attorney for the book-makers, and now advocating thedestruction of the pari-mutuels which would open the way for the return'Of Mr. Bruce's former clients to Kentucky.Mr. Bruce pleads ignorance of thecharacter of his clients or their selfishinterest in the following statement ton Breckenridge:"A number of statements are made ast my knowing that certain alleged conditions, in connection with racing, formerly existed, such as that race tracks werecontrolled by bookmakers, and that bookmakers retained twenty to thirty per cent,and that all sorts of rascalities were committed under this system. The fact isI know none of these things. ,It is said that I know that Cella, Tilles,.and Adler, of St. Louis, owned Latoniaand Douglas Park, and it Is said they ranbucket shops and race tracks in varioussections of the country. I recall thatCella had an interest in the Douglas Parkjockey Club, whether or not the otherpersons mentioned had any interest in itr not, I do not know; and whether or notthey ran bucket shops in other parts pithe country, I do not know. It is saidthat I know these things because I wasmi attorney in a suit instituted againstthe State Racing Commission seeking tohave the act creating that Commission."declared unconstitutional. It is entirely true that I was an attorney for theDouglas Park Jockey Club In a suitlmmght to test the constitutionality ofthat act, but it is not at all true that Ibeamed in that case, or otherwise, any.Tthe facts stated in the editorial as to.xamblinff conditions on the race tracks.Mr. Breckenridgemakes tb tot-lowing reply:uMr. Bruce knew that Cella, Tillesand Adler, who ran bucketshops andWee track In various cections of the-country, controled Latonia and Douglias Park; that there was a syndicate'hooks oQ'&n the tracks controlled byrtnem; that racing ia Kentucky wa Inla deplorable condition ; that the meetings were long, and under the syndicatejrysfcem of bookmaking every sort ofeascality was committed.; Mr. Bruce states: "I knew nonof these things.'"We avow that all statements-made by us are true; that all intelligent men connected with racing or interested In racing know them to betrue; that the facts were published inthe daily newspapers, and that in thediacaasion in regard to the enactmentrf the bill creating the State Racing'JommiflBion were alleged and not denied. But we accept at its face valueMr. Bruce's statement : "I know noneof these things.""Mr. Bruce does recall that CellaItsd an interest in the Douglas ParkJockey Club. It is interesting to knowtfcat this much of what was general'knowledge percolated through the atrmoephere of sweet innocence that surrounded Mr. Bruce. If he had thentfcad the slightest interest in the presertvation of racing, either as a sport oras an aid to the breeding of horses orjts a destructive agency of all that isrsood and noble, it seems to our munktaoe intelligence he would, have informed himself as to the controllingfactors in racing and certainly as toJthe personnel of his clients.it has been a long time since the"Stale Ilacmgommission was createdtend 1be effort made byline owners of;DoT!a Park and Latonla-Cella, Til3es and AdJer to Jave that act declar-'toacoaa-titatlonal.

C. McDowell, CatesbyWoodford, Johnson N. Camden, CharlesMcMeekin, Jouett Shouse, then editorof the Kentucky Farmer and Breeder,and Hal P. Headley. No man connected with Churchill Downs was invited to the meeting nor advised of itspurpose. John T. Shelby and John R.Allen were engaged to draw the actwhich was supported by all the breeders of the State, and passed by a practically unanimous vote of both housesof the Legislature.The purpose of the act was to prevent a continuation of such conditionsas were incident to the ownership ofrace tracks by Mr. Bruce's clients. Itprovided :"The said commission shall have thepower to prescribe the rules, regulations and conditions under which run-I nlng races shall be contacted In thisState."Ceiia. Tilles and Adler had controlof thSjLatania track and of DouglasPark. Eegflrdless of the interests ofracing, they had purchased DouglasPark and revealed their purpose tohave conflicting dates with ChurchillDowns and to conduct long meetings,as they did In Missouri. Mr. Bruceapparently attempts to put the basisof the amlt in which he tried to havetho State Racing GonuahNBton declaredunconstitutional on the ground thatthe State Racing Commission wascreated to kill Douglas Park.We avow that it was the desire ofall the men counected with the movemeat to have a State Racing Commission to remedy such conditions asexisted at every track under the control of Mr. Bruce's clients. We werethen as we are now opposed toa bucket-shop bookmaking combinationcontrolling race tracks in Kentucky; we were opposed then, as weare now, to a syndicate book robbingthe public and framing up races.It is provided in the act that Mr.Bruce's clients tried to -have declaredunconstitutional :"Provided, That a refusal of thecommission to grant any racing sssociation a license or to assign any racing association at least forty days, ifdesired, shall be subject to the reviewof the courts of the State."But Cella, Tilles and Adler werenot satisfied with this provision. Theywanted the whole act declared unconstitutional, for that act though itmay not be known to Mr- Bruce, whoknows so little, as repeated in his .communication today provides :'Said commission shall have thepower to prescribe the rules, regula-llfons aad conditions under which runPhing races shall be conducted in thisState."Uadw that provlatom. tje Statentg Ooainlssion hes tin pewer to. pro-Wbk bokaia1rinjr 'M4rf tracks a&dIt kas exercisereed th44put crazy economic theories intopractice.America has been working, andhas food for herself and to spare.Some things need adjusting Inthis country, to bt I sure, but we harenot yet deemed it wise to burn thejbarn down in order to kilUthe rata,-The Russians should think aboutthese thing whila tkty are eating;r jfertMl tkft'wtfttei. ,TOM, BOURBON NEWS,power, which was never done beforeits creation.Mr. Bruce may not know it, but wobelieve it to be a fact that the chiefreason his known client, Cella and hisactual clients, Cella's associates,wanted the act declared unconstitutional was thatit made possible thedestruction of their syndicate book.We do not say that Mr. Bructknows it, because after his statementwe fear to state that he knows eventhe most widely known fact, but according to the grand jury of Jefferson County it is a fact "that a vastnumber of handbooks are being operated in the city of Louisville."Ve have not heard of any movementby Mr. Bruce to stop these hand booksIf Mr. Bruce had succeeded in thesuit to declare unconstitutional thsfact creating the State Racing Commission there would be books on therace tracks as well as handbooks iothe city. The law now prohibits handbooks in the city. But they exist inthe city of Louisville, Yet Mr. Brucestarts a campaign against "legalizedbelting" and so far as we know takesno action against the illegal bettingthat is, in- our opinion, infinitely thegreater evil, which is rampant in hiaown home town."In the communication published thismorning, Mr. "Bruce says:"I have never pretended to makeany accurate statement of what arethe total profits of the Jockey Club,because I do not know them."Iii a statement by him sent throughthe Associated Pres:? from LouisvilleSeptember 17, he says :"A legalized giant monopoly enjoying the gambling privileges realizes aprofit of two or three million of dollars a year out of this demoralizingvice."Again we apologize for having stated in a previous editorial that Mr.Bruce knows this statement is inaccurate. But we avow that it is inaccurate and utterly misleading andknown to be inaccurate by every manand woman who has even cursory iuformation in regard to the purses andstakes given by the Jockey Club, theexpenses incident to the conduct oiracing and the taxes paid by theJockey Club.'Mr. Bruce closes his communicationwith this statement:"Pari-mutuel betting on the racetracks may be a safer form of bettingthan bookmaking safer for the gambler but I am not interested in protecling the gambler."Who is it Mr. Bruce is interestedin protecting? As a lawyer he waainterested in forwarding the interestof Cella, Tilles and Adler, who, thoughof course he never knew it, conductedbucket-shops and syndicate books.The present movement fathered byhim will inure to the benefit of thtibookmaker and handbook men, thougbequally of course he does not knothis. As proven by the result in NewYork, the success of the movement headvocates will lead to a form olgambling that is most pernicious andas a rule crooked.As revealed by the report of thegrand jury in Louisville, the handbooks flourish even In the ratified atmosphere that surrounds Mr. BructwNot interested in protecting thegambler? Of course not Not interested in the personnel of his clientswho employed his lerTices to destroythe State Racing Commlamtoa so thatthey might run race tracks la Kentacky as they ran them in Missourisolely for the benefit of the syndicatebook? Not interested in protecting;the breeding interests? What is MftBruce's real interest?His letter reveals, according to hisown statements, that Mr. Bruce hasnever been interested enough to ascertain even- tbe most widely knownfacts in regard to racing and thathe knows no more about It now thanhe knew when he was the attorneyfor Douglas Park and the bucket-shop-bookmakingaggregation that owned itWhy is Mr. Bruce giving his timeand his high ability and great reputation; and his money to this fight tohave repealed the provision in theKentucky statutes that was passedApril 8th, 1898, years before he appeared as the attorney for the DouglasPark Jockey Club?
