affects only matters connected with thedisasterTAT a riTTA Ofc J VV SC --Maine disaster have discovered thatthey can not have their bodies broughtto this country in cases where theyhave already been interred This isdue to the fact that the Spanish lawsforbid the exhumation of corpses untilthe expiration of the period of fiveyears after burialThe prohibition had its origin in thefear of infection from contagious diseases Some applications have already been made to have bodiesbrought to the United States by private individuals and they bave encountered this obstacleWhether an effort will be made tohave it removed is not yet apparentHavana Feb 20 The wreck of theMaine is slowly but surely sinking intothe mud Before the hull could beraised it would be necessary to removethe g uns and deck debris For lack ofproper appliances practically nothingin this line has been accomplishedAside from the officers and cabin effects the salvage thus far has beenpitifully small The cloudy weather and rain made the work ofthe divers unsatisfactory Fridayand very little was done It issaid that a hole has been madebv the divers in one of the forward ihatches and it is hoped that a numberof bodies will be recovered The courtof inquiry sat longer than usual Friday the six divers being examinedmore in detail than heretofore Thetime of the departure of the Mangrovewith the court for Key West has notbeen determined Capt Sampson saidFriday that it was doubtful whetherhis vessel would sail Saturday thatall depended on the developments ofthe testimonyWashington Feb 26 In spite ofthe stories that come from unofficialsources in Havana as to sensationaldevelopments in connection with thework of the divers in the Maineshull the administration remains firmin its statement that there is nocredible evidence one way or theother as to the cause of the disaster and holds to its purpose to awaitthe conclusion of the investigationnow making by the court of inquiryThis position was emphasized at Fridays cabinet meeting People wholooked for some startling announcement were disappointed as the numbers without reservation franklyadmitted that the subject of theloss of the Maine had been discussed but said the government hadreceived no information from Havanasince Thursday and had no intentionof changing its policy until there wassomething of substance to warrant itThe Spanish legation was equally inthe dark as to any of the discoveriesreported from sources that are notcited as was shown by the messagefrom Capt Gen BlancoHAVANAFeb 26 The United Stateslight house tender Mangrove is stillhere and the naval court of inquirycontinued its usual sessions FridayIts members hoped to get away to KeyWest late Friday evening or early Saturday morning but they are not surewhich it will be It is probable thatthe testimony of the civilian witnessesdid not add to the courts knowledge ofthe circumstances attending- the explbsion of the causes ofwtiich thesewitnesses could know

again at work removing such partsstartlinc discoveries m the wreck of i inthe Maine were less frequent but therewere enough of them still afloat Thursday to warrant Secretary Long in making this statement to the newspapermen as he left his officeSumming up the situation I shouldsay that the navy department knowsThursday nothing more about thecause of the disaster than it did fiveminutes after the receipt of the firstdispatch from Capt SigsbeeCant Sigsbees statement that thedivers have been down aft seven daysand forward four days gave the navydepartment the first information ofthe time that the divers had been inthe vicinity of the zone of explosionas he has termed it This zone is confined to the forward part of the shipand while the divers have been downaft for the last week their work forward in the vicinity of the large magazine has been in progress only fourdays which presumably began on Monday and included ThursdayWashington Feb 25 The EveningsStar has received the following cablegram from Mr Charles M Pepper itsstaff correspondent in CubaAt this writing divers are developingimportant results From examinationof the interior wreckage they have secured evidence which seems conclusivethat the explosion came from underneath the shipSome of the smaller magazines mayhave exploded The main ten inchmagazine did not explode The condition of the interior of the ship showsfurther probability of the wreck having been due to outside forceThe further the investigation progresses the more untenable becomesthe theory which the Spanish government adduced to show accidentalcause It is evident the Spanish causewill be based on the claim that a firpreceded the explosionWashington Feb 2G In view ofthe widely published report that theharbor of Havana contains a system ofsub marine mines a statement aroundwhich has centered the chief publicinterest in connection with the disaster to the battle ship Maine Senor DuBdsc Spanish charge daffairs atWashington Friday night made to areporter the following statementwhich coming- from such authoritymay be considered an official denial4I wish to state on own officialknowledge that no mine exists insideor

safe to move themnowTHE SPANIARDSWill Not Submit to the Powers the Arbitration of the Cuban TroublesMadrid Feb 2S Senor Sagastacommenting upon an alleged interviewwith Prince Bismarck in which thelatter is represented as suggesting thatthe Cuban trouble should be submittedto the powers for arbitration expressed his astonishment that such anidea could emanate from Prince Bismarck and declared emphatically thatnothing but ignorance of the question could inspire the notion thatSpain would suffer foreign intrusionor submit to arbitration in her indisputable rights of sovereigntyNobody said the Spanish premierwould dare propose such an absurdityand no Spanish government wouldlisten or dream of such proposalThe Imparcial in an editorial Sundayblames Spanish weakness

would go in any event Thegun factory at Washington is wherethey are made and they are sent tovarious points as the occasion requiresSo too the call for more men he saidis simply the reival of the recommendation in his annual reportThis statement by the secretary evidently was made to allay the impression caused by the reports of heavyshipments of guns from the Washington navy yard and other warlike measures The movements of some of thewarships such as the Detroit andMarblehead towards Key West hadalready been shown to have been inaccordance with orders not only madebut published in the newspapers aswell before the Maine disaster so thatthe secretarys explanation on thispoint is only confirmatory of the statements of the subordinate officials ofthe navy departmentThe telegraph

hallucinations of thedarkness become trivial I wondered ifmy imagination had played me a trickIt seemed as thoughihad heard thetils atix-5 tyoicenSidream sor unreal didUhe cir-- oumstance appear nowI was standing by the huge chimneywhen again breaking in upon mythoughts came the sound of that mysterious small voiceAs on the night before there were nocompleted sentences only a word be-tween pauses of various duration Thesounds were plainer however not louder but more distinctHere was a mystery indeed one whichdid not choose only the shades of nightfor its manifestations but came in thedaytime as though possessed of suchsubtle and unaccountable qualities thatit might defy researchAfter the voice had ceased and 1 continued my toilet the sound of talkingcoming from the walk outside reachedmeI glanced out of the window and sawSarah and Mrs Snyder again in mostearnest conversationSomewhat surprised to see my oldnurse so early in the day I called toherHello Sarah Whats the troubleWhat brought you here at this timeAch Nel bud I am glad to see youshe exclaimed I couldnt schleep allnightNow that was too bad I saidWhat kept you awakeI vas thinkin of you all alone in disolt house and so much strangenessaboud it the good soul replied withher honest old face upturned to meThat was very foolish Nothing isgoing to happen to me I said lightlyalthough I was not so sure of it nowWhen I went outside the two womenwere still talking and there was anawe stricken expression on each faceWhat are 3rou two superstitious oldgirls doing now I asked Hatchingup more mysterious talesMrs Snyder gravely shook her headas though seriouslj condemning levityon supernatural subjects Sarah rested her hand on my arm and gazed upinto my face There was deep concernin every line of her countenanceNel you come wiz me she saidleading the way I followed aroundthecorner of the house and she stoppedbefore a window the shutters of whichwere closedLook she exclaimed pointing toward the shutters Mrs Snyder saysdat vas not dere yesterdayLike those of most Pennsylvaniafarmhouses the downstairs windowswere provided with solid board shuttersIn the center of this particular pairras a small round hole from the edgesof which a few chips running with thegrain of the wood were brokenSWell what of it I asked hopingthat I could avoid giving an explanation for I was a trifle ashamed of myself for at my own reflectionSomepody shot through de shutteiand try to kill you maybe Its a bullethole aint it Oh Nel didnt you hearit Mrs Snyder heard it from herhouse and she look out her vindow anddown de roadafr a man runnin arayYou cant stay here 2sel You go homewiz meI could not forbear a smile at Sarahs fears but remembering theywere the consequence of the deep affection she felt for me I checked thefrivolous reply which myabout to uttertongueWhy bless your dear old lovingheart Sarah I said taking hold ofher arm come Ill explain that andwhen you know about it youll laughat meThe women went along into my roomYou see that window You remember the shutters were always keptclosed Well I had forgotten all aboutit last night and after I was undressedI saw my figure clad in my white nightrobe reflected from the glass Youtvomen must have made me somewhatnervous by your talk while making upmy bed Anyhow I was a trifle frightened at my own shadow and fired a bullet at it So you see no one tried tokill me at all It was only my own foolishness of wrhich I am heartilyashamed Now let me get some breakfast and then well go all over the houseto satisfy you there can be nothing init which could do me harmI said nothing about the voices I hadheard nor of the noise like the slamming of a door There was no use inadding to the inexplicable feeling ofalarm which my old nurse feltAs for the man Mrs Snvderhad seenafter the shot fleeinsr down the roadthnt was easily explainedIf my house had the reputation of being haunted it was most likely a passerby would have wings to his heels onhearing the report of a pistol about theplaceAfter breakfast we went through thehouseI noticed that all the windows wereclosed Therefore it was no sudden gustof air that caused the slamming of adoor But nothing was discoveredwhich would give one reason to supposethere was anything unusual about theplace rWe finally came to the attic and Ilooked out of one of the small windows first brushing away the curtainof cobwebsFrom this height I could see over theorchards On the brow of Sunset Hillabout half a mile distant wras a largehouse evidently quite newIt was a splendid structure for thecountry and I fancied a wealthy resident of the city had discovered thebeauties of Nelsonville and built hima summer residence hereWhose place is that over on SunsetHill I askedSome rich mans from de citj Sarah answeredDo you know his name I continued moved by curiosityVeil I did know Ach vhat is itnow I forget eferysing soon SarahrepliedHere Mrs Snyder chimed in Hisname is MorleyWhat I exclaimed in amazementMorley Sylvester MorleyI tont Jcnow his first name the oldwidow answeredr Has he a daugtiter IsYes and she so fine and prout Achand so jjretty Yes she is here Deylive here now in de summer continuedthe old lady glad for the opportunity ofimparting news I see dem almostefery day Dey drife by And him deman ach vhat a fine shentleman Sotall and straight such a fine peard andhe looks so prout tooThe garrulous old widows description satisfied me My heart beat rapidlj I had come into this secludedplace with no thought further from mymind than that I should find Miss Morley hereWas there a design of fate in thisAnd was she still my true love Perhaps I should see her but I remembered my determination and my promise to her father and how far I stillwas from removing the condition imposed on the renewal of our friendshipand I hoped our loveThis afterthought filled me with animpatience to commence some kind ofinvestigation on my own hookI had had a short interview with MrPerry the president of the bank justbefore m3 departure for Europe Ithad been most unsatisfactory to mefor Mr Perry was able to hold out nohope of immediate relief He was justas earnest however in advising me tostill keep on my course of apparent indifference and do nothing in the way ofa search myselfSince that interview six months hadelapsed and I had heard nothing fromhim I now resolved tc take the affairin mj own hands For to go on livingwith Florence Morley so near to meand still refrain from indulging in hersweet society would simply be tortureCome Nel Sarah finally saidbreaking in upon my thoughts We hafnot seen all yedCHAPTER VIWhen we were again standing in themain hall on the first floor Sarahs lastremark came to meWe have been over the whole househave we not What more is there

couldnt fint you for along dime Vhen ve did you vasaschleep in de cellarWell come along Let us have a lookat it I said eagerly The noise like aslamming of a door had seemed tocome from below Perhaps I shoulddiscover the cause down thereOn opening the door leading downfrom the dining room a musty odor assailed nostrilsIt is peculiar how the sense of smellbrings back to pne old associations andmemories I recollected that mustyodor perfectly and it brought back thedays of boyhood more vividly than anything else had doneTHE BOTJEBON NEWS TFJBSDAY MAECH 1 ljwasWe descended the stairway andfound the cellar bare and empty Ipeered into every dark nook and corner but there was nothing which couldhave caused the noiseNothing to be seen here Sarah Isaid Maybe we can find somethingof interest in the old storeroomMy grandfather in his latter dayshad kept the village store and postofficeThe house was built on the side of asmall hill so that it was three storieshigh on the street side and two in therearThe cellar was divided into two apartments by a thick wall of ptone Oneapartment was used for the house supplies The other section was in turndivided in two the front facing on thestreet serving as the store and postoffice the rear a deep cavernous underground room having been used forthe storage of barrels of vinegar molasses tobacco and dried fruitWe descended the open stairway leading down to the storeroom from themain hall The door was at the bottom and at first I thought it waslocked Upon closer examination I discovered that it had only become tightlyjammed by a slight settling of the surrounding timbers A few vigorous kickssoon caused it to open and we steppeddown into the roomThe shutters to the windows wereclosed but there was above the doorleading to the street a small transomThrough the dust and moisture-begrimedglass a few rays of light penetrated producing a twilight gloom inthe apartment but not so deep that wewrere unable to seeOne of the old counters still remainedand scattered over the floor wrere afew empty boxes and barrels I thoughtof the white haired old man whose formhad been so familiarly associated withthe room and I glanced over to thecorner with a fancy that he was herestill seated behind the deskVhy vheres de door gone Sarahcried out in tones of excitementWhat door SarahNel you know you remember Derused to be a door to de store cellarand now dere aint anySarah was right There had been adoorway through which I had stolenmany times for the purpose of fillingmy pockets with raisins and dried fruitThere was none now The wall of solidmasonry confronted usIt really seemed a matter of verylittle importance but Sarah kept upexcited exclamations about it until Ifinally stopped herWhy Sarah I dont see anything verystrange in the walling up of a cellarSes and she so fine and proutdoorway No doubt Mr Sonntag mylawyer had it done I remember theplace was dark damp and unhealthyHe thought it best to have it closedup perhaps There was another doorfrom that cellar leading outside wasthere notYes right unter your betroom vindow Sarah answeredWell that can be easily broken downif you want to get in the place Butwhat would be the use of all thattrouble I dont want to use the cellarBut then I remembered the noisewhich had seemed to come from beneath my bedroom and the cause ofwhich I was unable to discover throughout the rest of the houseWe might take a look at the otherdoor I finally said reflectivelyWe ascended the stairway and wentaround the house Thick vines reaching to my bedroom window completelyhid the outside cellar doorI parted the vines and found againthe solid foundation wall This doorway had also been walled upSarah was so greatly impressed bythis new discovery that her excited exclamations broke out anew and sheagain began to plead with me to leavethe placeAgain I sought to quiet her fears bylaughing at her although it did seema trifle strange that my agent shouldhave walled up the doorways I was satisfied he had had it done and I wondered what his reasons could have beenPerhaps after all Mrs Snyder wasright in affirming that there were mysteries about the old house Perhapsthis walled up cellar was the seat ofsupernatural demonstrations and myagent had sealed it up for that reasonI do not intend to lose any sleepover it I said lightly Sonntag musthavp had good reasons for doing thisand I can easily find out what they wereby driving over and seeing him I wantto have a talk with him anyhowHere the rumble of wheels reachedmy ear As 1 glanced clown the roadway and saw the

which seemedto have a bearing upon the robberyThe next morning I was awakened bythe sun shining in my face Hardlyhad I got my eyes open and my sensesaroused to my new surroundings whena loud and long continued thumpingon the front door caused me to springout of bed Hastily donning a few garments I went to the door and openeditMrs Snyder was standing there andan unmistakable look of relief cameover her face when she saw meAch my you schleep so sountl vasafrait somesing de matter she saidBreakf as vas retty long dime alrettyAll right Ill be right over and eatit I repliedWhile I was dressing the recollectionof the strange voice of the last nightcame to me Now in the broad glare ofthe forenoon when all mystery takesflight and the hallucinations of thedarkness become trivial I wondered ifmy imagination had played me a trickoic4jdreamso unreal didthe circumstance appear nowI was standing by the huge chimneywhen again breaking in upon mythoughts came the sound of that mjrsterious small voiceAs on the night before there were nocompleted sentences only a word between oauses of various duration Thesounds were plainer however not louder but more distinctHere was a mystery indeed one whichdid not choose only the shades of nightfor its manifestations but came in thedaytime as though possessed of suchsubtle and unaccountable qualities thatit might defy researchAfter the voice had ceased and 1 continued my toilet the sound of talkingcoming from the walk outside reachedmeI glanced out of the window and sawSarah and Mrs Snyder again in mostearnest conversationSomewhat surprised to see my oldnurse so early in the day I called toherHello Sarah Whats the troubleWThat brought you here at this timeAch Nel bud I am glad to see youshe exclaimed I couldnt schleep allnightNow that was too bad I saidWhat kept you awakeI vas thinkin of you all alone in disolt house and so much strangenessaboud it the good soul replied withher honest old face upturned to meThat was very foolish Nothing isgoing to happen to me I said lightlyalthough I was not so sure of it nowWhen I went outside the two womenwere still talking and there was anawe stricken expression on each faceWhat are you two superstitious oldgirls doing now I asked Hatchingup more mysterious talesMrs Snyder gravely shook her headas though seriously condemning levityon supernatural subjects Sarah rested her hand on my arm and gazed upinto my face There was deep concernin every line of her countenanceNel you come wiz me she saidleading the way I followed aroundof the house and she stoppedbefore a window the shutters of whichwere closedLook she exclaimed pointing toward the shutters Mrs Snyder saysdat vas not dere yesterdayLike those of most Pennsylvaniafarmhouses the downstairs windowssvere provided with solid board shuttersIn the center of this particular pairvas a small round hole from the edgesof which a few chips running with thegrain of the wood were brokenWell what of it I asked hopingthat I could avoid giving an explanation for I was a trifle ashamed of myself for firirfg at my own reflectionSomepody shot through de shutteiand try to kill you maybe Its a bullethole aint it Oh Nel didnt you hearit Mrs Snyder heard it from herhouse and she look put her vihdow anddown de roadan- a man runnin avayYou cant stay here Nel You go homewiz meI could not forbear a smile at Sarahs fears but remembering theywere the consequence of the deep affection she felt for me I checked thefrivolous reply which my tongue wasabout to utterWhy bless your dear old lovingheart Sarah I said taking hold ofher arm come Ill explain that andwhen you know about it youll laughat meThe women went along into my roomYou see that window You remember the shutters were always keptclosed Well I had forgotten all aboutit last night and after I was undressedI saw my figure clad in my white nightrobe reflected from the glass Youwomen must have made me somewhatnervous by your talk while making upmy bed Anyhow I was a trifle frightened at my own shadow and fired a bullet at it So you see no one tried tokill me at all It was only my own foolishness of which I am heartilyashamed Now let me get some breakfast and then well go all over the houseto satisfy you there can be nothing init which could do me harmI said nothing about the voices I hadheard nor of the noise like the slamming of a door There wras no use inadding to the inexplicable feeling ofalarm which my old nurse feltAs for the man Mrs Snyder had seenafter the shot fleeing down the roadthat was easily explainedIf my house had the reputation of being haunted it was most likely a passerby would have wings to his heels onhearing the report of a pistol about theplaceAfter breakfast we went through thehouseI noticed that all the windows wereclosed Therefore it was no sudden gustof air that caused the slamming of adoor But nothing was discoveredwhich would give one reason to supposethere was anything unusual about theplace tWe finally came to the attic and Ilooked out of one of the small windows first brushing away the curtainof cobwebsProm this height I could see over theorchards On the brow of Sunset Hillabout half a mile distant was a largehouse evidently quite newIt was a splendid structure for thecountry and I fancied a wealthy resident of the city had discovered thebeauties of Nelsonville and built hima summer residence hereWhose place is that over on SunsetHill I askedSome rich mans from de citj Sarah answeredDo you know his name I continued moved hy curiosityVeil I did know Ach vhat is itnow I forget eferysing soon SarahrepliedHere Mrs Snyder chimed in Hisname is MorleyWhat I exclaimed in amazementMorley Sylvester MorleyI tont Jcnow his first name the oldwido v answered - 3Hashe a daughter Is shehereYes and she

ach vhat a fine shentleman Sotall and straight such a fine peard andhe looks so prout tooThe garrulous old widows description satisfied me My heart beat rapidly I had come into this secludedplace with no thought further from mjmind than that I should find Miss Morley hereWas there a design of fate in thisAnd was she still my true love Perhaps I should see her but I remembered my determination and my promise to her father and how far I stillwas from removing the condition imposed on the renewal of our friendshipand I hoped our loveThis afterthought filled me with animpatience to commence some kind ofinvestigation on my own hookI had had a short interview with MrPerry the president of the bank justbefore my departure for Europe Ithad been most unsatisfactory tp mefor Mr Perry was able to hold out nohope of immediate relief He was justas earnest however in advising me tostill keep on my course of apparent indifference and do nothing in the way ofa search myselfSince that interview six months hadelapsed and I had heard nothing fromhim I now resolved tc take the affairin my own hands For to go on livingwith Florence Morley so near to meand still refrain from indulging in hersweet society would simpty be tortureCome Nel Sarah finally saidbreaking in upon my thoughts We hafnot seen all yedCHAPTER VIWhen we were again standing in themain hall on the first floor Sarahs lastremark

noise like aslamming of a door had seemed tocome from below Perhaps I shoulddiscover the cause down thereOn opening the door leading downfrom the dining room a must3 odor assailed m3 nostrilsIt is peculiar how the sense of smellbrings back to pne old associations andmemories I recollected that mustyodor perfectly and it brought back thedajs of boyhood more vividly than anything else had doneTHE BOUKBON NEWS TUESDAY MARCH 1 IQWe descended the stairway andfound the cellar bare and empty Ipeered into every dark nook and corner but there was nothing which couldhave caused the noiseNothing to be seen here Sarah Isaid Maybe we can find somethingof interest in the old storeroomMy grandfather in his latter dayshad kept the village store and postofficeThe house was built on the side of asmall hill so that it was three storieshigh on the street side and two in therearThe cellar was divided into twp apartments by a thick wall of ptone Oneapartment was used for the house supplies The other section was in turndivided in two the front facing on thestreet serving as the store and postoffice the rear a deep cavernous underground room having been used forthe storage of barrels of vinegar molasses tobacco and dried fruitWe descended the open stairway leading down to the storeroom from themain hall The door was at the bottom and at first I thought it waslocked Upon closer examination I discovered that it had only become tightlyjammed by a slight settling of the surrounding timbers A few vigorous kickssoon caused it to open and we steppeddown into the roomThe shutters to the windows wereclosed but there was above the doorleading to the street a small transomThrough the dust and moisture-begrimedglass a few rays of light penetrated producing a twilight gloom inthe apartment but not so deep that wewere unable to seeOne of the old counters still remainedand scattered over the floor were afew empty boxes and barrels I thoughtof the white haired old man whose formhad been so familiarly associated withthe room and I glanced over to thecorner with a fancy that he was herestill seated behind the deskVhy vheres de door gone Sarahcried out in tones of excitementWhat door

easiry broken downif you want to get in the place Butwhat would be the use of all thattrouble I dont want to use the cellarBut then I remembered the noisewhich had seemed to come from beneath my bedroom and the cause ofwhich I was unable to discover throughout the rest of the houseWe might take a look at the otherdoor I finally said reflectivelyWe ascended the stairwa3 and wentaround the house Thick vines reaching to my bedroom window completelyhid the outside cellar doorI parted the vines and found againthe solid foundation wall This doorway had also been walled upSarah was so greatly impressed bythis new discover that her excited exclamations broke out anew and sheagain began to plead with me to leavethe placeAgain I sought to quiet her fears bylaughing at her although it did seema trifle strange that my agent shouldhave walled up the doorwa3rs I was satisfied he had had it done and I wondered what his reasons could have beenPerhaps after all Mrs Sn3rder wasright in affirming that there were mysteries about the old house Perhapsthis walled up cellar was the seat of-supernatural demonstrations and myagent had sealed it up for that reasonI do not intend to lose any

most unexcusable bill thatwas ever enacted into a law in Kentucky P P Johnston in a telegram toa member of the House last week said ifthe bill becomes a law it will destroythe Democratie party A party thatwould make itself responsible for such ameasure is not entitled to the confidenceof the people and deserves that theyshould rise in their wrath and sweep itfrom power and position and drive itinto exile until a new generation of leaders shall arise who will not dare invadetheir rights or attempt to destroy theirlibertiesThe bill is in the hands of the Governor who will veto it and then there isone desperate chance that it may fail topass the Senate over his veto as it hadon its first passage in that bouse a bareconstitutional majority If it becomesa law we have seen the last of free elections in KentuckyThe purpose of this bill is to place thecontrol or all elections in tne nanus or aState Board of Elections composedthree men to be elected by theofture and this State Board shall appointa County Board of three men whoseduty it shall be to select all officers ofelection in their county and to receiveand count and certify the returns Inthis way the appointment of electionofficers is taken out of the hands of theCounty Judge who is elected by thepeople and responsible to them andplaces it in the hands of three men notelected by the people and not responsibleto anybody It is not sufficient to saythat this law will be always administered by honest men who will see to itthat every qualified voter is permittedto cast his vote as he pleases and to havefl it counted as cast It nil tho RipRhnnBoards were always trie bestmen in thecounties even 60 b a law as this mightwqrk no wrong But who th uas anyknowledge of politics in Kentucky hasthe least doubt that in many countiesthe election machinery will fall into thehands of men who will have no otherconception of duty than to see to it thattheir side wins The gentlemen whohave forced this bill through The Legisture and who by the unusual method ofcalling a caucus of the House Democratsana masing tne Dili a party measuresucceeded in whipping into its supporta few weaklings who wonld like to haveopposed the bill if they had dared thesegentlemen were loud in their protestations that the bill had no other objectthan to secure fair elections in Kentucky Is there any reasonable manwho believes for a moment that thiswas the purpose of the framers and promoters of this bill Isit not perfectlyapparent that the intent of the bill is tomake a fair election in Kentucky impossible We believe that no sane mandoubts that this would be its effectThe News is far from believing thatanything it may say on this or any othersubject will have any weight with thoseviolent and extreme gentlemen at Frankfort who eeeni to act on the idea thattheir first duty to those who elected themis to opposo whatever any sound moneypaper may advocate and advocatewhatever such paper may oppose Butwe do our duty ty the public when wecall thair attention to this iniquitous billand denounce It as unworthy the support of any citizen who believes inhonest elections and in the right of thepeople to govern themselves We

shoulders Whetherthis was natures frolic or the freak ofsome former owners humor Ricardodid not inquire That was immaterialinasmuch as the mule had four legs freefrom eccentricities and as the prudentKicardo had taken pains to demonstrate could pull well at the arrastrarpoleRicardo was delighted with his acquisition He could see in it the dawnof a new prospeiity a rainbow of delightful promise Mi favorito he exclaimed patting the beast fondly as hetethered and fed him on that first nightof his proud proprietorship ah mifavorito The mule placidly chewedthe straw which Ricardo offered butdid not respond to his endearment withso much as a winkIt was a brilliant moonlit night afiangT time and occasion for an exchange of sentiment but there was ablank expression on the mules facethat disturbed the impressionableRicardo He disappeared returnedwith a tallow candle and held it beforehis companions eyes as if more intentlyto studj his physiognomy Not a shadow of change passed over the beastscountenance not u blink nor a sign ofcuriosity was aroused by the sputteringdip When his new and charming owner lifted his head the blue mule gazedcalmly into the firmament as thoughthe candle were a part of it and thenplunged his nose again into the strawbrought from the Valley of Sonoyta 50miles away where things growAy el estrangero said Ricardo reflectively swindler Ricardo couldexpress his thoughts in two languagesbut that was all he said It was evidentthat his mind had reverted unpleasantly to him who had passed onNext morning Ricardo tied the muleto the arrastrara pole fastened thebadge over his eyes and set him at workas though nothing had happeued Hespoke genially to his beast hit him inoffensively with the rawhide as a merematter of form and the blue muleplodded cheerily upon his endless journey Imagine a circular pavement oflarge fiat stones with a double rimmade of two rows of smaller stones seton edge in the center an upright revolving shaft from which a pole radiateshorizontally to the outside of the circlebound to the pole midway a heavy blockof granite and hitched to the polesouter end the blue mule A burro comesdown from the mountains with 250pounds of ore on his heroic little backand gets his first drink of water forthree days Ricardo dumps the ore intothe puddle of water and quicksilver inthe arrastrar and it is ground into apaste as the mule drags that heavyblock of granite over it in the little circle Walking around and around thebeast would become dizzy were he notblindfolded one readily sees that andcongratulates the hoodwinked mules onthe happy and honorable way in whichthey have been befooled into thinkingIhey are getting aheadA swarthy corpulent man withstraight black hair and a feeble fuzzof beard contrasting humorously

1 1898It was late in the afternoon and nearthe end of Ramons shift In half anhour his alternate would come to relieve him If he was to carry out theplan which his tempestuous brain hadevolved as he lay sleepless and torturedon his bed of straw through the nighthe Ramon must soon act and nowwhen they were absorbedin oneanotherwhen Ricardos eyes saw no more thanthose of the bandaged mules now wasthe time the very nick of timeSo behold Ramon creeping to thearrastrar where Azul was sweating athis toil Behold him stealthily crawling to the further rim of the mill withan open knife in his hand while the bluemule unconscious of the danger plodded around and around again to thespot where he hid -and the two loverschattered blithelyDiablo muttered Ramon fiercelyA knife flashed once twice and thedeed was done With an oath of satisfaction Ramon crept back to his workand the blue mule apparently ignoring him displayed some petulance toward a gnat which had alighted on hisshoulder then tranquilly pursued thelong road which led to nowhereFor how could Ramon have achievedhis ignoble purpose by the murder ofAzul That would have been but halfa revenge while the retribution he hadplotted was all shattering and complete He had laid the train for an exlIosion an earthquake The two strokesof his knife had cut the bandage fromthe mules eyes that was all but wasnot that enough Azul would growdizzy and dizzier and would fall in histracks the mill would stop and Ricardo all given to his charmer wouldnot notice the episode The alcaldewould soon stride by for had not thecunning Ramon sent him a false message to lure him home He would observe the idle mill and the fallen mulehe would see Ricardo neglecting hisduty to dally with Teresa Ah hewould say no such lazy careless fellow shall be a son of mine Up youloafer Leave my daughter and attend to work No begone I will nothave you work for me Poltroon Nevercome near nry arrastrars or cast a shadow across my path again Ramoncould see and hear it all and his littlesoul dilated Meanwhile Azul pursuedhis circular pilgrimage as constantlyas the earth revolved in its orbit andthe lovers prattled as unceasingly asthe spheres sang to each other in theheavensThen Ramons successor came to relieve him and he would be free to witness the denouement The blue mulecould not keep on his feet much longerhe must soon stagger and fall and bythat time the alcalde would pass Therecould be no failure all was going welland Ramon making- a skillful detourhid behind the alcaldes chicken houseto watch and wait and see his triumphYes there was the alcalde across thearroyo He had received the messageand left his store Patience But themule Why did he not pause Whydid he not stumble Why did not theearth swim under his feet Why did henot fall in a heap in the path Ramonsblood boiled as die saw Azul steadilyjmlling the mill around as he had drawnit for hours without a false step without a sign of distressAnd see The alcalde had come upRicardo raised his sombrero and thegreat man nodded to the happy coupleWith his business affairs going forwardwhat magnate could object to polite attentions to his daughterfrom the eligible oneBut Ramon swore an oath unto himself His heart was a lump of lead andbeads of perspiration stood on hisbrow How he wished he had made another use of the knife And all the timeAzul was keeping on his course asas Jupiter or the far UranusAll things seemed unnatural and distorted to Ramons turbulent brain Hehad witnessed impossibilities Now heimagined that the blue mule looked upat him and sneered sardonically and itmade him furious Then he heard Azullaugh a long loud irritating maddening laughWhen the mule brayed Ramon sprangto his beside himself with rage andchagrin and started to flee He couldstay in Quitovic no longer He wouldput miles between himself and the sceneof his humiliation But a heavy handwas laid violently upon him and borehim to the groundSo you are the thief are you saida voice that made him quake Ithought no better of you fault findermurmurador It is you who has beeneating my pulletsAlas for the quivering Ramon hecould not utter one word of defense orprotest and little would it avail him ifhe could The alcalde both made lawsfor Quitovic and executed them Withhis strong arm he dragged the wretchto his feet and led him off to the calabooseWhen Ricardo found the severed bandage he divined the secret of it all andhe laughed softly Always a man ofgentle moods he was too happy now toharbor a grudge1 Ah mi favoritohe said to the muLe as he caressed himthat night he did not know that youare blind He did not know that it wasall the same to you And Azul woregarlands as well as Teresa when theyrode to the little adobe church at SanAn tone where Padre Francisco marriedand blessed

building and thelongest ladder at hand fell short tenor a dozen feet of reaching her Theboldest man in the crew had vainly attempted to reach her and in the efforthad sprained his foot There were

gotten out of order andinaj be fed in the same way to the general flock But its wider use is as pasture For this purpose t is a good planto jJant some at the time of oats sowing and plantevery two or three weeksafter that until the 1st of August Thiswould under ordinary circumstanceslurnish good pasture throughout theseason TVhen the rape is two feethigh the sheep may be turned into itlambs

received periodical dressingsof barn yard manure have been deprived of the greater portions of theirmold And as is also an admitted truththat mold is an indispensable ingredientin every productive soil it stands toreason that when in the course of improvident culture it has been extractedit is essential that it be restored Thequestion then hew shall this restoration be brought about is one of fullinterest to every farmer Those whohave ample resources who have fullsupplies of animal and mineral and vegetable manures who have the materialson their land to form composts comprising the elements in question needlook no further for the means of restoring the needed constituents to thesoil But those who are differentlysitualed who have but little manureand are but ill supplied with the rawmaterial to make compost must turntheir attention to the best means oiplacing such matters in the soil as willform mold The growing and plowingin of green crops is often advised ancwe here repeat that advice No soilcan be truly productive unless bothorganic and inorganic plant foods arepresent The air can supply a portionof the organic food as clover roots canby their tubercle bacilli convert theunavailable nitrogen of the air intoavailable plant food This can be doneonly while the plant is growingWhat kinds of crops should be cultivated and plowed in This questionmust be solved by

remained severaldays at the hotel and advertised that bpforehis departure he would give a grand exhibition of the efficiency of the green glassties Early in the evening when the exhibition was advertised to take place a largeand curious crowd gathered in front of thehotel The agent caused a fire to be built inthe street boxes and barrels being piledmany feet high After seeing that the firewas roaring merrily the agent made his appearance bearing an armful of fire grenadesHe hurled the bottles one after another intothe blazing pile but instead of smotheringthe flames the grenades seemed to have theopposite effect The fire blazed up nearlytwice its former height and the surrounding buildings began to shed their paintwhile the crowd drew back from the fierceheatThe agent was the most astonished man inthe group until he learned that the son ofthe hotel proprietor had extracted the grenades from the sample case poured out thecontents and then filled them with gasoline The crowd soon found out that thegrenades had been doctored and yells ofderision nearly drowned the protests ofthe agent as he attempted to persuade thehotel proprietor that the house should paythe costs of the
