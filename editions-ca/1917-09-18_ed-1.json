cious and called the police, who took
him to jail.
Smith first priced the horse arid
buggy and harness to the men for
$185, and then sold it to them later
for $60. After his arrest he confess
ed that it was not his horse and
buggy, and stated that he came to i

cinnati and hired the horse and bug
gy from a livery stable, and drove to
Winchester. He did not remember

him the outfit.
Inquiry o Paris liverymen did not
