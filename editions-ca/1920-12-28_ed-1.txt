CVS-o -a $?&tt&ltBBDkFor some time after the opening toregular passenger service, the Central Union Pacific railroad's subordinate departments were rather crude.The sleeping cars were comfortable,but there were no dining cars, and thefacilities at the "restaurant" stationswere decidedly primitive.When the eastbound train arrived atCheyenne one morning, the passengersin the sleeper, all but one small group, !responded prompjtly to the summons."Thirty minutes for breakfast!" Theypassed into the large tent which wasequipped as a dining room; longplanks on rather high "horses" covered with white "domestic" for tables,and single planks on smaller "horses"for benches at the sides. But the foodwas excellent, varied, bountiful, andadmirably cooked, while the flapjacksand maple syrup were delicious.The one group that' had not left thesleeper consisted of Colonel Templeton, his young wife, and their six-months'-oldbaby. When all who intended to take breakfast were seatedand had served themselves or beenserved, the colonel reached over andtook a milk jug, from which he filledthe baby's mug and proffered to theproprietor a dollar, the price of a fullmeal.The proprietor refused the moneyand -with needless emphasis said:"You ken eat all' you want, but yercan't take nothing away!" "But I'veeaten nothing and am taking only acup of milk for my baby."While the proprietor was emphasizing his indifference to the baby'sneeds, there was a commotion on theside of the table toward the exit andpresently a typical cowboy swung himself over and drawing his gun,marched up to the proprietor andpointing the mirzzle of the pistol athis face, said, "Let the baby have hismilk !"The proprietor did not hesitate, butsaid to the colonel, "All right, go on !"Then the colonel extended the dollarbill, whereupon the cowboy swungupon him and shouted. "Are you goin, to give a dollar for a cup of milk?Get outen here!" The colonel got,nor did the proprietor oiler to detainhim. The crowd cheered, while thecowboy returned and ordered a plateof fresh flapjacks.

It is obvious that the remedy can come onlyfrom outside.America saved 6,000,000 European children winter before last. Normalrecuperation cut the need nearly in half last year, but unusual conditions haveresulted in scant shrinkage of child destitution during the twelvemonth justpast. The response of America must now decide whether 3,500,000 of thesecharges, in acute' distress, shall begin to be turned away in January frommore than 17,000 asylums, hospitals, clinics and feeding-stations dependenton American support. There would be no tragedy In history so sweeping orso destructive of those who can deserve no evil.The undersigned organizations, working among every race and creed,many engaged also in other forms of relief, , agree unanimously that theplight of these helpless children should have complete priority in overseascharity until the altuatfon is met. - "Tulg is an Issue without politics andwithout religious lines. There can be no danger of pauperization, for the$23,000,000 for child food, and the $10,000,000 for medical service that weseek, will relieve enlyithe critical cases. The medical supplies, of course,must be an unqualified, gift, but for every American dollar used in childfeeding, the governments and communities aided furnish two dollars in theform of transportation, rent, labor, clerical help, cash contributions and suchfood supplies as are locally obtainable.America has not failed in the past in great heartedness.
