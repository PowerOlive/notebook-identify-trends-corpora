umzj&NS of PARIS READ! THIS I
f CONCERNS YOU!
Public notice has frequently been
given that you should boil all water
used' for domestic or drinking pur
poses, whether it be from hydrant,
well, cistern or spring. There may
be water-borne disease at any time
of the year, more especially, how
ever during the late summer and
autumn months.
This Board has no information to
suspect such disease or diseases pres
ently, yet it realizes such possibili
ty, and the object of this notice is to
protect the public against any dan
ger from this source.
Don't be unfair and say you have
fnever seen nor heard of this notice.
The quickest means to reach all the
people is through a city's local pa
pers, hence this communication.
Again, WATER-BORNE DISEASES
ARE ABSOLUTELY PREVENTED
BY BOILING WATER. Will you
need this admonition or will you wil
fully or negligently pursue the even
ttenor of your way and regard this
Notice as worthless? It is up to you.
Antiques in furniture may be all
right. In milldams they are danger
ous, and this Board so condemns.
Changes in treatment of the water
supply have been recently suggested
and are now in operation.
