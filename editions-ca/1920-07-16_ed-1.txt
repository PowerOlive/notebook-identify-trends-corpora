Itwas claimed in the warrants thatShelton had endeavored to per-persuade the men to enter his employ elsewhere, which, under thestatutes, is a criminal offense.Great difficulty was experiencedby the attorneys in examining tnewitnesses. Being Mexicans tueycould "no sabe" English, and theonly answers evoked in response tothe questions put to them by tne attorneys was "Me no spake de Anglishe." Various means and variousla-nguages were restored to, but noresults were obtained until the official interpreter was brought in fromthe Simms farm, then the matterwas straightened out. The attorneys engaged in the case were E. M.Dickson, representing Irvine, andCountv Attorney D. D. Clme andformer County Attorney Denis Dundon the prosecution, and the MasonHanger Company.During the progress of the examination of one of the witnesses, Attorney Dickson asked a question towhich the reply sounded like a manwith a mouth full of hair pins."Your Honor," said Mr. Dickson,"I can't hear what the witness issaying."

Themother was formerly Miss MaggieFarrow, of Paris. Mr. Culbertson isalso a former resident of Paris.Kenneth Alexander, of NewIn the home of Edward M. Noldthere is a bedpost. Many otherhomes have bedposts four, at least,and some several times four but theNold bedpost had a message to deliver, a message A life-saving importance. It ought to have a Carnegie medal, that bedpost.Edward M. Nold was injured inthe service of the United StatesArmy in April, 1917. The injuryleft him paralyzed from the waistdown. All the army doctors available or interested, tried to help him.Eight different operations were performed. But none of the operationswere of any benefit.As Nold lay helpless he thought ofmany things he wanted to do andcouldn't. He wanted to study music.Having the talent, he wished t0 express it and get the joy that comeswith the exercise of such skill. Alsohe wanted the normal joys of life,such, for instance, as being able towalk in the sun.But instead of these things he gota wheel chair and his discharge fromthe Army. For encouragement, thedoctors told him the truth. Theyhad kept it from him as long as theycould."Your case is incurable," pronounced the physicians, and so hewas shipped from the hospital to hishome in Sedalia, Mo.Thus things drifted along from thedate of his injury in April, 1917, toOctober 7, 1919. It was on the latterdate that the bedpost took a hand.On that date, because he was helpless, he suffered a fall. The bedpoststruck him in the back.Now, to strike in the back is asocial blunder, but the bedpost knewnothing of this and if asked to defend itself would undoubtedly haveretorted : "Look what I did for him."Getting struck in the back causeda sensation in one of Nold's toes. Ashe said, describing the incident, "Itgave me hope."The reason for his hope was thathe had heard of chiropractic and hethought a chiropractor could at leastno as well adjusting his spine as abedpost.The first adjustment brought asensation in one hip. The second dayit reached one foot. The third day itwas in both hips.. On the fourth dayfull sensation returned to both legs.In three weeks he began to walk. Onemonth later he walked a mile withcrutches. In six weeks he walked amile without crutches. Today he isnormal.. Today he is in San Francisco studying music, with good prospect of achieving his ambition and hishappiness.The fall against the bedpost happened to strike the right joint of thespine in just the right way to givethe pinched spinal nerve a little momentary freedom. Nold, as a result,felta sensation in his toe. The chiropractor does by art and skill whatthe bedpost did by accident. But eventhe chiropractor could not have succeeded in Nold's case in one adjustment. He needed to continue thework of restoring nerves, musclesand ligaments to a normal position,day after day, for six weeks, beforea complete adjustment of permanentvalue had been made. The bedpostopened the nerve line into the toefor an instant, then it closed again.But Nold got the message which fateintended for him d so today he isrestored to usefulness.This seems, a wonderful case butis isn't It is as simple as two andtwo make four. Today many peopleare going through life with some partof the body only half alive a partthat is diseased because it is failingto get 100 per cent, of impulse fromspinal nerve lines. To such persons,the spinal adjustment is a God-send,a wonder worker. Yet it is onlv soI because it brings back what Natureintended you to have health, vigor,viality, real nervous strength andforce in every organ of the body.o .NEW WHEAT POURING INWith the wheat harvest well under way in Bourbon county, newwheat is pouving into the localmills and to other dealers.

In many instances the land owner can make noimprovement that will pay him aslarge dividend in dollars as a goodsystem of drainage. It is true thaisince w 1916 "hen it cost approximately ?18 to grow an acre of cornat an average price of 87c a bushel,it costs about $30 an acre to drainland. Now the price of corn is$2.00 a bushel and it costs approximately $25 an acre to produce cornand the tile diainage will cost about$60 per acre. It should be remembered that the average value of allplowed land for the State in 1916was $35; while the value of thesame land now is approximately$70. It is good business for a manto invest money in tile drainage ifhe can realize better" than 100 onthe investment every year.

In the days of kings, ifthe sovereign had wisdom, the government was safe; but with us, the peopleare sovereign, what they think determines every issue of whatever nature.Unless they be well-trained, and well-Instructed, and well-informed; unlessthey know how to value and to appreciate American institutions, and American ideals, democracy will have difficulty in enduring. The defenses of ourCommonwealth, the defenses of our nation are not material, but mentaland spiritual. Our first lines of defense are our public schools. Our fortifications and our soldiery can repel an invasion of armies from our shores;our greater menace, an invasion of ideas, can be repelled alone in the schoolroom. The form of reconstruction, of which our people are in most seriousneed, is a reconstruction of their thoughts and of their ideals.Kentucky is experiencing a wonderful educational revival. We havecome to understand that our schools must be preserved and improved atwhatever cost. The opportunities of the child living in the country must bemade equal to the opportunities of the child living in the city ; all the children of all the people in all the state must be given an equal chanoe. Theteachers, whose unselfish devotion to duty has caused them to remain loyalto their task even at personal sacrflce, must be given adequate compensation. Better paid teachers will mean better prepared teachers ; better prepared teachers will mean better taught children ; better taught children willmean better citizenship. .Our last General Assembly gave us a constructiveand comprehensive program of school legislation. But laws do not enforcethemselves; they are 'but lifeless things until public sentiment has breathedinto their nostrils th breath of life. In the name erf Kentucky's childhood,Kentucky's surest hope ; In the name of patriotism, whose shrine is the public school, I urge the people of our Commonwealth to a generous support of,and a genuine Interest In, our public schools.

The writer saw a few day3ago a four cylinder 'tractor motorwhich had been badly broken up,due to the ignorance and carelessness of the operator.A farmer borrowed the tractorfrom a neighbor and "he let an inexperienced hired man operate it.One of the oil pipes in the force lubrication system leaked, but theoperator neglected to fix it or towatch his oil gauge on the crankcase, and before he noticed it,enough oil was lost to allow thecylinder to get dry. The . pistonstuck and the connecting rod brokein cylinder No. 1, which in turnbroke the cylinder wall and thecrank case.Due to the ignorance of this operator, it will cost the farmer about?200 for repairing the tractor, inaddition to having to do without itjust at the time when every. hour' ofwork in the field means so much ingetting the work done at the propertime.The following suggestions if putinto practice will eliminate manytroubles:1 Never depend upon anotherman to lubricate the tractor you expect to run, but be sure personallythat every part is properly oiled.2 Study your instruction book,and learn how, when and where tolubricate.3 Use only the kind of oil recommended by the manufacturer ofyour tractor.4 Watch the oil indicating devices and be sure that they areworking properly.5 Follow the manufacturer'sinstruction as to how often tochange the oil in the crank case otyour motor. Learn how to tell whenthe oil has become so diluted by theheavy fuel oils working down pastthe piston rings that its lubricationproperties have been destroyed.Further suggestion? in regard tothe care, the repair and use oftractors may" be obtained by writingto the Agricultural Engineer, University of Kentucky, College of Agriculture, Lexington, Ky.MATT, ORDER HOUSES CHECK UPMERCHANTSLocal merchants in localitieswhere the mail order houses arcpulling strongly, may wall be reminded that these great trading medims obtain most of their resultsfrom effective advertising; therefore the merchants must advertiseadequately if they are to successfully meet the keen competition.Sears-Roebuck - Co. have 200girls employed in checking newspapers to ascertain the volume andkinds of advertising carried. Intowns where the local store . advertising is small, or otherwise unimportant, special campaigns are instituted, bundles of literature are distributed, etc.It is an actual fact that thecheck-up system of Sears-Roebuck& Co. reveals that the business returns to the company from townswhere the local advertising in thehome papers is light, are very highwhen compared with the receiptsfrom localities where the homemerchants use large amounts ofspace.The lesson is plain. The localmerchants must fight fiie with fire.They must fight mail order propaganda with home-town advertising.We all 1-now that direct advertisingis the best advertising in a merchandising campaign. Various selfstyled "merchandising counsellors"assert that the mail order housecatalogue is one of the best examples of direct advertising in existence. How can it compare with theuse of space in a home town newspaper, where the dealer'e goods andaddress are printed? The store iswithin easy reach, goods may beseen and inspected with the expenditure of a few minutes' time. Thisis the real direct advertising. Ittransfers an article from the dealer's show-case directly into the customer's pocket.REPUBLICANS ARE "CLAIMING"The Republicans are with greatenergy claim5 ng that the administration of the late Republican Congress was economical and considerate, while the previous Democratic ICongresses were extravagant andreckless. There are two ways tolearn the truth of this business, oneis to see the net reduction of taxes;the other to compaie the amounts ofappropriations made during peacetimes. Now, after the armisticewas signed, before the RepublicanCongress came m, the Democratsenacted legislation that actually reduced taxes from eight billions tosix billions for that year and tofour billions thereafter, and the Republican Congress has not reduced itsince. On the contrary, the Republican Congress has provided for theexpenditure of $5,403,330,327.80.Traveling conditions in Francehave become so bad that the womenworkers are .demanding that aspecial calriage on each subwaytrain be reserved for women.1oMiss Esther M.

Morrow n behalf of the Kentucky MemorialBuilding campaign.Workers from campaign headquarters at Lexington will go outduring the next two months tocounties throughout the State toconduct local drives to raise the$130,000 remaining of the $300,000 needed for jthe building,That this is not a local memorialfor Lexington, but in commemoralion of all Kentucky's war heroesand for the special benefit of students at the University of Kentuckyfrom all sections of the State, wasemphasized in a statement made bythe campaign chairman.The 15,899 former students of theUniversity have included men andwomen from every county of theState, the smallest group being fourfrom Edmonson county, and thelargest 3,468 from Fayette.THE DROWNING SEASONYear after year at this seasonnewspapers are admonishing theirreaders to be careful while bathingin the rivers, at the seashore, orwhile dipping in the waters ofwhatever pleasure resort they mayhappen to be visiting where bathingis a feature, yet, year by year thefatalities continues to grow. Herein Pa: is a death recently endued ofa young lid who could not swim.The lesson sought to be convoyed isthat everyone ought to know how toswim.Death by drowning in the summer months seems to be almost acommonplace form of immolation.There are no rules governing theexpert swimmer, unafraid, whousually .pays the forfeit of his lifefor indiscretion. If he would recognize the elementary truth he wouldnot meet with disaster. Amongthese truths may be included thefutility of even a strong man's efforts against cramps or suddenfright. No human is immune fromcramps, and, therefore, it is unsafefor any human to venture heyonathe reach of aid.The bottom of Stoner Creek, incity and county, for instance, is fullof small springs of ice-cold water.Swimmers on a warm day have "letdown" in the water, to hurriedly ascend to the surface, as their feetwould strike these cold springs.Often cramps have been caused bythus recklessly tempting fate, 'inoforces of nature are too much fcrthe puny strength of an individual.The unintelligent, the fool whorocks the boat, and the boy or manwho takes desperate chances, merely to "show off" to his friends andcompanions are helpless. Nothingcan save them from themselves.Many lives would be saved annuallf by ordinary precaution on thepart of really intelligent pleasureseekers. To learn to swim shouldDe one of the first things taught aboy or girl when they arrive at thelight age. The lads of too tenderage who may be seen accompanyingtheir elders on a trip to the "oldsmimming hole" in Stoner or Houston creeks, may in time learn tohandle themselves in the water, butthey should not seek to do so without a competent teacher.. oJack in Garden.Jack-in-the-pulpit, by nature a boglover, is by no means as fastidious asthe most of its clan, and a moist,slightly shaded spot in one corner ofthe yard will amply supply its demands, says the American Forestry association of Washington. This plantis a near relative of the cultivated,calla, with purple and white or greenand white striped blossoms usuallycalled flowers. The real flowers,though, are deep in the center of thisshowy dress, at the base of the centralspadlx, and may be either fertile orsterile.oMadagascar Gold.A curiosity preserved at the Philadelphia mint Is a small consignment ofgold from Madagascar, which Is of anextraordinary brightness. It was mined,smelted and put up for shipment fynatives, who, for a receptacle, took apiece of bamboo six Inches long andtwo Inches In diameter, polishing theoutside to glasslike smoothness. Thenthey put a wooden cork -in one end,poured In the meked gold and corkedup the other end.0Bank of England.The Bank of England is not a government institution, as is popularly'supposed. It was projected by WilliamPaterson, a Scotch merchant, to meetthe difficulties experienced by WilliamHL in raising supplies for the waragainst France. Forty merchants subscribed 500,000 towards the sum of1,200,000 to be lent to the government at 8 per cent, In consideration ofthe subscribers being incorporated asa bank.oSaving the Tin.After trying many other processes ofrecovering tin from old cans there Isnow, according to La Nature (Paris) , areturn to the old-fashioned method ofboiling the scraps (well cleaned) in asolution containing an excess of freealkali and saltpeter.

I suffered with stomachtrouble as bad as any woman everdid and only my close friends andneighbors knew the awful conditionI was in. My stomach was so badlyupset I could hardly eat a bite without being in misery afterwards, lSometimes I wasn't able to retain athing I ate and I would bloat upwith gas until I felt simply awful.My heart would palpitate and I became alamed for fear I had hearttrouble. My nerves were completely shattered and just any littleunexpected noise would upset me.It was impossible for me to eversleep good and I just hate to thinkof the many nights I spent rollingand tossing in agony. I fell off inweight until I lost about fiftypounds and was actually so weak Icouldn't raise my hands to myhead. I was almost a perfect wreck,and, in spite of all the money I spentand the many different medicines Itook in an effort to get relief, Igrew worse instead! of better. Finally, I was told that an operation wasnry only hope."However, I decided to try Tanlac first, as I had heard so muchabout it and I will always be thankful I did because I am now relievedcompletely of all my troubles. I wasastonished at the way Tanlac beganto build mo up. Why, it seemedthat it was made especially for mycase. My appetite returned and Istarted eating things I had not dared to touch in years and my lostweight and strength began to comeback. I have now finished my thirdbottle of Tanlac, and I'll declare, Ican hardly realize what a wonderfulchange it hab made in me.
