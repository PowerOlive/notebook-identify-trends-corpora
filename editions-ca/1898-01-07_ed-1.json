Consumption
Catarrh invariably leads to consump
tion Growing worse and worse each
winter those who rely upon the usual
treatment of sprays washes and inhal
ing mixtures find that it is impossible
to check the disea e with these local
applications which only reach the surface-
The offensive discharge increases
all the while and gets deeper until it is
only a question of a eort time when
the lungs are affected
The importance of the proper treat
ment can therefore readily appre
ciated But no good whatever can be
expected from local applications as
such treatment never did cure Catarrh
and never will Being a blood disease
of the most obstinate nature Swifts
Specific SSS is the only remedy
which caa have the slightest effect upon
Catarrh It is the only blood remedy
that goes down to the bottom of all stub
born diseases which other remedies
cannot reach
Mrs Josephine Polhill of Due West
S C writes
I had such a severe case of
Catarrh that I lost my hearing in one
ear and part of the bone in my nose
Ploughed off i was constantly treated

with sprays and
washes but each
winter the disease
seemed to have a
firmer hold on me
I had finally been
declared incurable
when I decided to
try S S S It
seemed to get right
at the seat of the
disease and cured me permanently
for I have had no touch of Catarrh
for seven years
The experience of Mr Chas A Parr
of Athens Ga was like that of all
others who vainly seek a cure in local
Hill UK
ircaLmeui nc says
For years I suffered from a severe
case of Catarrh the many offensive
symptoms being ac
companied by severe
pains in the head I
took several kinds of
medicines recom
mended for Catarrh
and used various local
applications but they -

Specific and after four months I was
perfectly well and have never felt any
effects of the disease since
Those who have had the first
touchof Catarrh will save endless suf
fering by taking the right remedy at the
outset Others who nave for years
sought relief and found only disappoint
ment in local treatment will find it wise
to waste no further time on sprays
washes inhaling mixtures etc whioh
are only temporary and cannot save
them from dreaded Consumption
They should take a remedy which will
cure them because it can reach their
trouble SSS is the only blood reme
dy which can reach Catarrh it promptly
gets at the very bottom of the disease
and cures it permanently
SSS Swifts Specific is a real blood
remedy and cures the most obstinate
cases of Catarrh Rheumatism Conta

and Eczema which other so called blood
remedies have no effect upon whatever

The Charm of the Popples
Very anoient is the history of the pop
py It was wreathed with the lotus in
Egypt and twined with thyme and pars
ley in Greece It was also one of the
flowers dedicated to Venus and the
witches who wrought their spells and
muttered their incantations on the
mountain tops cast into their brew the
horned leavos
It -was early recognized that the pop
py in its simplest form is one of the
most decorative of flowers Its simplest
form is of course the wild flower of
four petals It is treated decoratively in
a number of ways either as a flat de
sign of the lifted cup or as a conven
tional representation of the four petals
encircling the receptacle or as the stem
upholding the domelike and sometimes
strongly ridged seed pod but after all
the most marvelous artistic suggestions
are found in the sharply outlined leaves
which rise to slender Gothic points
These serve as models of leaf design and
were carved boldly and delicately in the
stone of aacient cathedrals
There is always something artificial
in the appearance of the cultivated pop
pies They lack tho stability or reality
and ever suggest the gypsy masquerad
ing as the princess
Poppies with very few exceptions
are not in the least difficult to grow
Seed sown in the fall or spring will
produce plants that flower all summer
They do not demand an enriched soil
and profuse watering but grow in an
independent careless fashion that is a
relief after an experience of the exac
tion of some plants Nancy M Waddle
in Godeys Magazine
Traps and Trapping
The ways of trapping are as various
as the ingenuity of savage or civilized
man can devise I like best tho traps
that one can make They seem to give
tho animal a fairer show they develop
our own constructive faculties and the
nearer we can get to the savage way
the more fun it always is Steel traps
have a placo that wooden traps can
er fill but give me something that I
can make with my own hands with the
simplest tools out of whatever materi
als the spot affords where the animal
lives
Of all the animals in this country
there is none that affords less harmful
sport than the rabbit more properly
hare of which there are several spe
cies Its wonderful powers of increase
enable it to hold its own as far too
many of our best and most valuable
animals do not Furthermore rabbits
are very easily trapped
Every one knows its little trail as
broad as ones hand through the bushes
or broom sedge or its footprints as it
hops over the clear snow Here where
the path goes undor a fence rail it has
stopped to gnaw The rabbit follows
this path in season and out though in
the far north where the snow keeps
piling andpiling up its little road may
change with each successive snowfall
Trappers there put out a large number
of snares setting themjright in the mid
dle of the paths Harpers Round Ta

IiUthers Bones
It is generally supposed that the
bones of tlie great reformer were torn
from their last resting place in the
church of the castle of Wittenberg dur
ing the Thirty Years war and scattered
to the winds like those of Wyclif
At all events no trace of Luthers tomb
has hitherto been discovered One of
the biographers of Luther Herr Koesfe
lin of Halle has however raised no
little sensation in religious circles in
Germany by a recent article in a theo
logical magazine which throwsover the
accepted explanation of the disappear
ance of the returners tomb as mere fic
tion He declares that two workmen
engaged on the restoration oil the church
in Wittenbecg castle came across the
coffin and body of LutherfwithoutT let
ting any of their comrades know of
their find It is alleged that they enter
ed the chapel by night and dug out the
remains secretly reinterring them in
fear of arrest There ought to be no
difficulty in discovering whether thero
is any truth in Herr Koestlins state
ment Westminster Gazette
Petit Larceny Not Womans Sin Alone
The story comes from England of a
novel being found in the strong room of
a firm of publishers written entirely
upon the note paper ef a London clnb
The thing is significant for two reasons
First because the novelist was a man
and second because petty larceny has
long been supposed to be tho prerogative
of woman It is a fact that in this
country at least it is women who pilfer
the detachable privileges to be found in
railway stations the waiting room of
department stores hotels and like
places It has been found necessary to
chain Bibles themselves Itisn tsovery
long ago fchat when a woman arose to
read her bulky extemporaneous address
at the meeting of a certain womans
club her listeners upon the back of
each sheet of manuscript could descry
the sign and seal of a woll known hotel
This wasnt so bad of course as a
whole book but it was -bad enough
