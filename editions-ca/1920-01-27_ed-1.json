Earl Barton. Mrs. Barton gave a
luncheon in their honor at her home
near .Millersburg-:
VThe leavy sleet here Thursday
and Friday was very destructive.
Shadp' trees were badly damaged,
many completely ruined, and tele
phone and electric poles were demol
ished. On Friday morning there
were but six telephones of the Home
Telephone Company in operation,
and not jmany more of the Cumber
land. There was no serious damage
to pedestrians from falling on the
ice, aithoug-u quite a number werel
badly shaken up. Friday and Sat
urday the streets were badly block
ed by falling telephone poles, wrire
and trees. During the time of the
greatest destruction, the mercury
was only a few degrees below freez
ing. It was the most destructive
sleet in many years. Most of the
electric light damage was repaired
by Saturday morning. We are com
pletely isolated, both at home and
with the outside world in telephone
communication.
Augustus E. Wilson, former Gov
ernor, has indicated an intention to
become a candidate for the Republi
can nomination for United States
Senator on the ground that he is en
titled to make another race against
Senator J. C. W. Beckham, who de
feated Wilson in 1914. He said he
wanted to have the fight all over
again, "under circumstances quite
different form those that obtained
different from those that obtained
Willson said it was his under
standing that Colonel A. T. Hert,
National Committeeman from Ken
tucky, and other party leaders had
agreed upon Richard P. Ernst, of
Covington, as the logical man to
make the race.
This, Mr. Wilson declared, would
have no effect on his candidacy.
He recalled that in a former pri
mary for the Senatorial nomination,
when the organization was against
him, he defeated Mr. Ernst by 7,000
votes. tf'ISttR
