Every gallon pays a big dividend
There's as much difference between sprayed end im
sprayed vegetables as there is between those grown on good
and poor soil. A gallon of spray material costs only a few
cents, but the increase in the value of vegetables sprayed with
it amounts to dollars. Try spraying as an investment.
