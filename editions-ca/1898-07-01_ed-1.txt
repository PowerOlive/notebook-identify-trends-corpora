than half the force hestarted withThe Cubans who are harassing himonly number about 200 men but in thepasses and in the bush they are at agreat advantage - It is probable thatimmediate steps will be taken to throwa force of Americans and Cubans between Gen Pando and Gen LinaresPressed as the latter is on the east hecould not spare a man for a sortie tothe westAdm Sampson has ascertained thatAdm

Gen Linareshas shown great military tact in slowly retiring t during the last few daysas he has gradually drawn our troopsaway from the protection of theAmerican ships and brought themclose to the fire of the Spanish shipsin Santiago harbor For this reasonit was with relief the announcementwas received here that Shafter hadsucceeded in landing all of his artillery including his siege train for unless Sampson can oe relied upon toforce his way into the harbor and attack the Spanish ships these siegeguns planted on heights commandingthe bay will be the main reliance ofGen Shafter in offsetting the presenceof the Spanish ironcladsUndoubtedly Shafter is animated toattack as soon as possible by hisknowledge of the approach of the reinforcements for Linares from Manzanillo for with this additional forceShaffers position would be disagreeable if not perilous at least until hehad received reinforcements Thewar department received the firstdefinite news Wednesday as to theapproach of these ipanish reinforcements This was in an official dispatchfrom Gen Shafter stating that S000men with pack trains and droves ofanimals were advancing from Manzanillo and were 54 miles from SantiagoIt has been known through reportsfrom Lieut Joyce made to Gen Milesthat the Spaniards have 12000 men atManzanillo and 10000 at Holguin andevery precaution has been taken toguard against their advance from eitherquarter The official report Wednesday showed that S000 of those at Manzanillo had covered half the distanceto Santiago and it is the belief ofmilitary officials here than Gen Pandois making similar advance with his10000 men from Holguin These advances now practically unopposedare regarded as one of the most serious phases of the situationDevastated by a

forsticking I mean proceeding Its hardwork cause I never wrote a real storybeforeThe reason why my story happenedon the fifth was cause Fourth of Julycame on Sunday that year so that firecrackers and other celebrations had towait overAnd it was hard for the boys thatwaited judging from experience MrSimpkins said that too It sounds wellI think besides being a factWell mother said I could get up atfive a m on Mondaj and not a minute before and then I did think motherwas very trying indeedI knew Id wake up sooner and surenough I did and heard the clockstrike four It was a long time tillhalf past four and four minutes fromthat the sun would rise I knew for Idlooked in the almanacI just raised up in bed to peek at myfirecrackers and punk lying handy andthat half hour was longer than theotherI can tell 3rou it didnt take me longto slide iuto my clothes when the timecame and I did wash my face thoughmy toothbrush happened to slip back ofthe washstand and I didnt feel liketaking the time to get it outTod heard me moving round andcame in from her room so I had tohelp her a good deal and that wasteda lot of time But shes a smart childand combed her own hair pretty wellconsideringPraps you dont know that Todsshort for Toddlekins our 3oungestSomebody thought I meant a dog oneday when I spoke of her but I thinkTods a fine name being short and sortof briskWell we tiptoed downstairs sos notto wake anybodyTod slipped down one step droppedher torpedoes and began to cry But Ispoke tuas mui h like Jerry as I couldnot a wora or you gu backto bedThat scared her so she jumped anddropped another package so I had tosTlWrpick her up and carry her out f thefront door quick torpedoes and allIt was a fine day a glorious Fourthor maybe I should call it a Fifth onlythat doesnt sound rightNo one was around cept the menat the station who were getting theearly train readyBilly Crocker had promised to meetme and I was going to provide himwith firecrackers cause he spent hismoney for lemon balls and felt delicate bout asking for any more to celebrate withBut no Billy showed up So I let Todfire off a good many crackers and sheonly burned her dress in one place Itwas a

the honey-producingtimber is gone and waste lands reclaimed and cultivated These causeswith frequent poor seasons render thehoney crop uncertain and worst of allcomb honey in the cities is quoted 7 to12 centsFormerly I raised comb honey almostexclusively and shipped nearly all of itto commission houses But some yearsago I unexpectedly had about a ton ofautumn extracted honey to dispose ofSiipped to a ccmmission house it wouldprobably have netted four to five centsu some time I had never triedpedaling honey and I was verj imtehprejudiced against peddlers and peddling but I wanted more for thatiioney I loaded some of it into thewagon put up in convenient packagesfor retailing and started though withmuch trepidation I knew a few rebuffs would send that- honey to thecity for what it would bring But Isold honey at nearly every house over300 pounds the first and decidedthat peddling honey at least was notsuch bad business after all Manyneighbors and acquaintances who hadpassed by frequently for years andseen the sign Honey for Sale butnever bought a pound of my honeybought freely when it was carried tothem And they didnt buy afterwardeither unless 1 carried it to them andBsked them to buyThe ton of honey was soon sold abight to eleven cents per pound according to quantity wanted and severalthousand pounds more were boughand sold at a fair profit Since thattime I have raised mostly- extractedhoney always retail it myself and amgetting the same prices now in theselimes of very low prices that I did tenyears ago Honey if a good articlewill sell itself almost anywhere ifgiven a fair chance I have never founda place in country or town where itwould not sell fairly well any time ofyear though in the fall is best in myexperience after the bulk of fruit isgone and the
