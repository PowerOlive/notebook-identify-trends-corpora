The farmer is now called upon as
never be'fore to bring his soil to its
maximum yielding capacity. He
must -seek the most economical means
of attaining this end. He should plan
not alone for this year, but for years
r to. come, for permanent agriculture
should be his aim. He must both
build up and maintain productivity
of the soil. He must use the land,
not abuse it. The aim should be to
build up the soil now under cultiva
tion. When this is done it is time
to look to idle land. Remember that
it requires less labor to produce 40
bushels of wheat on one acre than on
two. Professor J. W. White, Penn.

WOMEN BUN CURB MARKET.
A curb market recently organized
by the women of Miami, FJa., has
proved so successful that the City
Council has taken it over as a (muni
cipal enterprise. The plan was work
ed out by the urban home demonstra
tion agent of the United States De
partment of Agriculture and the
State Agricultural College, together
with several of Miami's public-spirited
women, in order to give fairer
prices to both the housewife and the
producer. A committee co-operates,
with near-by truckers in arranging
for the produce. The truckers are
planting every two weeks in order to
guarantee the women a constant sun-
ply of fresh vegetables. Fruit, eeers.
j butter, cottage cheese, and poultry
j are also sold. A fee of 25 cents is
paid by all those selling products,
: This oes in to, a general fund for ad-
yertising the market-and keeping the
street clean.

CORRECT USE OF ENGLISH IM
PORTANT. BUSINESS ASSET.
(New York Commercial) J
Discussions of the value of schools
of journalism, literary composition,
play writing, &c, have become a r&fe
ular summer feature. Both sides
are right up to a certain point. No
course of instruction can turn com
imon clay into great poets, philoso
phers, playwrights or editors; but it
is possible to teach any person tof
average intelligence to express his
thoughts in clear and decent English.
Our public institutions of learning,
as a wnoie, tail to teach pupils to
speak, write and spell the common
language of the country. Whena
young man or woman applying for
work in a newspaper office is so gift
ed it almost invariably turns out
that the home circle, and not jt&e
school, deserves the credit. There
are just enough exceptions to the
rule to prove that it is possibleito
lear English in school. The right
kind of instructors can teach pupils
to speak and write it no matter what
the nationality and education of the
parents may be. The ambition of
children is easily aroused by injunc
tions to talk like a lady or gentle
man, and they can be induced to crit
icize one another's speech out of
school and appeal to a sypipathetic
teacher when they cannot settle the
dispute among themselves.
It often makes the typesetter blush
with shame, when putting into type
some of the High School graduate's
essays, with the way they butcher the
English."' You often hear them say
that punctuation marks have about
gone into the discard. Let them try
it on a good lawyer, and see how long
they will last. Many a page in a law
brief has been reprinted on account
of the omission of the compna, period,
etc., or the misplacing of same.
Higher seats of learning have to
waste time and energy in teaching
what every twelve-year-old child
should know almost by instinct.
Careless speech is a great handicap.
Most of those who study rhetoric in
its various forms at these schools, of
literature will not become literary
lights; but, if the system of instruc
tion is sound, they will acquirethe
art of constructing simple sentences,
and they will carry thejm far in'bus
iness if they fail in art. Sneers at
"hacks" are out .of place. Business
men are seeking stenographers and
secretaries who can avoid tying knots
in the English tongue.

We have headaches and colds, not
at all realizing our body is in need
of some good pure oxygen.
Mechanics take ntuch better care of
tlieir machinery than they do of their
own bodies. They know that unless
the machine is cleaned,- oiled and
rested occasionally 'it will not run
properly. How often do they think of
the importance of caring- for their
human machinery? They run it- at
the highest tension, feed it on stale
