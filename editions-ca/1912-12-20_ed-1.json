The Woman Makes the Home
She makes it best who, -looking after the
culinary department, turns her back resolute
ly upon unhealthful, cr even suspicious, food
accessories. She is economical; she knows
that true economy does not consist in the use
of inferior meat, flour, or baking powder. She
is an earnest advocate of home made, home
baked food, and has proved the truth of the
statements of the experts that the best cook
ing in the world today is done with Royal
Baking Powder.
