THE PEOPLE AND THE COURTS
In a Mississippi county not long
ago a mob broke into the jail one
night, took a prisoner a white
man-s-from the Sheriff and hanged
him to a nearby tree. The man had
been convicted of the murder of a
woman and was under sentence of
death, but his lawyers had appealed
to the Supreme Court for a new
trial.
This lynching cannot be excused,
of course, for it was a terrible
wrong. But it can be explained, at
least to some extent. The people,
or a' part of the people, feared that
the delays and technicalities of the
law would be used to thwart the
end of justice.

impose heavier sentences upon per
sons convicted of violating the pro
hibition laws. The grand jury said,
in other words, that persons convicted
of this offense were not being suffi
ciently punished.
These two instances are cited to
