One of Them a BeaHtiful Irish laws Ex
plains Why Many of Them Do So They
Are Hooking For Good Matrimonial
Catches Titles Wanted Usually
Under the titl Feminine Types In
London Jesse Frahois Sheppard gives
iH La HomvelU Revue an account of
the Loaion barm aide
They are recruited he says
among the bourgeoise aswell as among
the lower classes Some of the most in
teresting types can be found in the bars
or public houseB of the west end close
to the fashionable theaters Among
them are very many perfectly respecta
ble girls who have chosen the career of
a barmaid in order to make at living
and especially if they are pretty to get
a chance to oatoh a rich husband
A public house situated at the angle
of one of the principal thoroughfares is
both a gilded palace and a mine of gold
It exeroises a strange fascination upon
the poor country bumpkins who have
just enough to pay for a drink but the
dude coming out of a theater the coun
try greenhorn the fashionable snob and
the frequenter of the music halls are al
ways to be found there It is among
these that the barmaidshunt for a hus
band If there is one class of London
society more stupid than another it is
that one which includes the frequenters
of the public houses With a pipe in his
mouth and a glass of beer or whisky in
front of him the young Englishman
dressed -in fashionable style with a
slight and elegant figure and regular
features remains standing for more than
an hour paying pretty little compliments
to one or several of these ladies
The barmaid judges her customers
by the cut of their clothes If you want
to attract her attention you must pre
sent yourself with a silk hat and a
handsome cane in your hand and a suit
cut in the latest fashion The high hat
is de rigueur Without that there is no
possible chance of success
It was not without difficulty that I
managed to get an interview with one
of these young ladies whose intelligence
was equal to her beauty At first I was
astonished at finding so much intelli
gence in an English girl but I learned
that she was Irish and that explained
the mystery Her father was dead and
her mother was left without resources
So she was determined to come to Lon
don and look for a husband by posing
behind a bar in Piccadilly
I was hardly more than three days
here she said with an amiable and
roguish air when I understood why it
was that so many pretty English girls
dont get husbands When they are
beautiful they are generally stupid
When they are intelligent they are cold
masculine and ugly Englishmen travel
a great deal and meet in their ramblings
through the world very many sprightly
women and they do not care for pretty
girls who donfrknow how- to chat with
them
But in this mixture that comes here
to drink and chat I said how do you
distinguish the men of the world from
the others
I recognize them by three things
she said boldly 6by their figure by
their clothes and by their complexion
For the most part they are tall and thin
dressed in the latest fashion and have a
complexion more or less bronzed This
last trait is the surest sign Seeing that
I looked astonished she added
ing can be more simple An English
gentleman if he has a fortune passes
three fourths of his time hunting and
in other open air exercise The chaps
who remain always in London have a
paler and more delicate complexion
and moreover the expression of their
faces is quite different from that of the
others
Noticing with what attention I was
listening to her she continued The
gentlemen that I refer to have nothing
elegant about them except their clothes
for their conversation laoks novelty
How can a man who understands noth
ing but hunting and cricket interest an
intelligent woman The conversation
that goes on here in the name of wit
makes me tired but these gentlemen are
the easiest of all to deceive They are
great big children in everything except
sport and politics
But you are always engaged I
said and it is difficult to get an oppor
tunity to chat with you You muBt al
ready have had several offers of mar
riage
v I have been only one month here
and I have already had three Two
were from very rioh sportsmen but
riches alone wont do for me What I
am after she added laughing is a
title You know I must have a title
At this rrioment the play in one of
the neighboring theaters was over and
the public house was invaded by a
crowd of men more or less stylish The
beautiful Irish girl kept herseif some
whataloof and only served customers
that had the appearance of gentlemen
Well I left London A few months
afterward on returning there I wanted
je approved by the undersigned to see once more my beautiful Irish bar
Master Commissioner payable to him- maid She was gone Another lady was
self -and bearing interest from date until
patd at the rate of six per cent per an
num having the force and effect of a
judgment -
in her place and she told me that Miss
Clara had left to marry the second son
of a prominent nobleman
Addition to Yellowstone Park

the Yellowstone Nationa4 park says
that an effort is being made to secure

coming harvest is so short according to
estimates reported to the State Depart

will reduce Australia rrom her posi
tion as sixth wheat exporting of the
globe to about the eleventh wheat im
porting country Instead of being an
exporter of about 12000000 bushels per
year Australia will have to import not
far from 5000000 bushels The United

Dear Sir I heard of Dr Bells Pine

its wonderful valuable merits I thought
I would try a bottle - I have been seri

with a cough and pains in my side and
breast that were causing me a miserable
life I spent hundreds of dollars with
doctors and for medicine but every
thing failed until I tried this wonder
ful remedy It beats the world and
has saved my life I recommend Dr
Bells Pine Tar Honey to everybody
with weak lungs It is a great success
