In the first game of the champion
ship series ot the Blue Grass League
at Winchester Wednesday aftdnoon,
Paris came out the victor, winning a
close and exciting game by the score
of two to one. The contest was a
pitchers' battle between Shears for
Fans and Burden for the Hustlers in
which the former excelled.
McKernan chose Shears to pitch the
opener because of his performance
agamsc tne nustiers last Saturday in.
tne contest wrncn resulted in a com
plete blanking for Coleman and his
men and the big side-wheeler showed
his class in the opening tilt.
Burden showed signs of returning to
hjs old time form but he was not
equal to the determined Bourbonites
who laid onto his slants for ten safe
bingles. Heretofore the Hustler main
stay has been very effective against
Paris, and his Btrikeouts were numer
ous but on this occasion he whiffed but
three of the locals, wnile Shears fan
ned an even half dozen of the opposing
batters.
The Bourbonites put up a fast field
ing game, and while the Hustlers
the ball hard and frequently, it was
difficult for them to get their drives
beyond the reacn of the Paris fielders.
The first run of the game came in
the second session. Maxwell, the first
up, sent a stinging drive through the
pitcher's box and was advanced to the
second station by Kuhlman's sacrificp.
Chapman singled to the center garden
and Shears sent a short fly to the tight
field, Brown, Walsh and Lake making
an effort to get the ball, which fell
safely, Maxwell scoring. Harrell lined
to Olson who doubled Chapman at sec
ond. Harrell's steal, Laross7 error and
McKernan's single in the fifth, put a
crimp in the Hustlers, when another
run was pushed over the rubber. Chap
man bounced one to Burden and Shears
rolled one down the third base line to
Goosetree and was out. Harrell sin
gled o right and pilfered the second
sack, going to third on Laross' low peg
and scored when McKernan singled to
the left garden.
The Hustlers counted their only run
in their half of the fifth. Laross bunt
ed and went out Mayer to Barnett.
Lake grounded to Shears and .Coleman
singled to right. Burden followed
with a double in the same territory,
bcoring Coleman. Walsh walked and
Reed hit a stinger over second whicn
Harrell stopped with a wonderful
effort, forcing Walsh at second.
s This ended the run getting on either
side and the contest closed with Paris j
one to the good. The features of the,,
game were the fielding of Kuhlman
and Harrell, each performing some!
very difficult stunts at short and third j
robbing several of the Winchester men
of what looked to be clean hits. The
score is as follows:
Paris 0 10 0 10 0 0 0-2
