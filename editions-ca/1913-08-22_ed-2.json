LEXINGTON BANKS TO
GET BANK FUNQS.
When the Treasury Department
makes official announcement of the
amount of Government money for the
movement of crops that is to be depos
ited in the banks of the South and
West it will be found that Kentucky
has secured about $1,500,000, of which
$1,250,000 will be sent to Louisville
and $300,000. to Lexington. This in
formation was secured on high au
thority Wednesday and next week it is
expected the department will give out
a list of banks in Kentucky which are
to receive the money and the amount
to be deposited in each.
During the recent conference of
bankers Louisville's committee asked
I ' co rnn nnn AKnnf Vioif nf n-io ft3
000,000 askked for is to be allotted. It
is understood that Louisville's deposit
will compare favorably with that of
other cities of larger size and in an
equally strategic position in respect to
crop movement.
The money will be sent to the Lou
isville, Lexington and other banks of
the South and West as soon as they
have deposited their security. It is
probable the names of the banks se
lected as depositaries will not be made
public until the money is on its way to
them. A committee, one nember of
which will be a citizen usually a
State banker representing the Gov
ernment, will pass on the collateral
offered as security for the Government
deposits by the banks in each city.
NO TOMATOES WITH WHICH
TO CONDUCT DEMONSTRATION.
The girls' canning clubs in Kentucky
this year resemble the play without
Hamlet, as far as campetition under
the Federal scheme isc oncerned, and
the drouth is to blame. The Federal
Department of Agriculture has cast
the tomato for the principal role in
its demonstration work in household
economics, and tomatoes are about the
scarcest things in the State this year.
Mrs. Hellen Wolcott, of Shelby ville,
who is in charge of the canning club's
organization, gave two demonstrations
last week, one at Henderson and the
other at Hopkinsville. At Henderson
the tomatoes had to be bought on the
market. Bullitt county is another
with a girls' canning club, but no to
matoes, and other counties are little
better supplied.
Nothwithstanding the lack of mate
rial for competing for the Federal
prizes, Mrs. Wolcott reported that she
has found widespread interest in the
demonstration work. Girls' canning
clubs have been organized in Jeffer
son, Mason, Bullitt, Henderson, Chris
tian, Madison and Warren counties.
FERTILIZER EXPENSIVE
LUXURY IN KENTUCKY.
Commercial fertilizer is an expen
sive luxury for' the farmers of this
State who spent in the neighborhood
of $1,500,000 during the year 1912 for
fertilizers. According to statistics
furnished Commissioner of Agricul
ture Numan by Prof. H. H. Kastle,
Dean of the Experiment Station at
Lexington, the amount of fertilizer us
ed in the State during the last five
years has increased fifty per cent. In
1908 35,000 tons were used; in 1909,
43,000 tons; in 1910, 57,000 tons; in
1911, 63,000 tons and in 1912, 65,000
tons. Fertilizer sells for $20.50 a ton,
with 50 cents a ton added for freight.

street, Tuesday morning at 10 o'clock,
after only a few days' illness of chol
era imorbus. Mr. Williams is survived
by his wife and three children, Mrs.
M. M. Culberson and William Will
iams, of this city, and Mr. Joseph Will

FOREST NOTES.
A Russian scientist claims to have
discovered an inoculation for use
against forest insects.
There are nearly six thousand pro
fessional foresters in Germany who
are associated with various technical
societies.
The University of Washington has
secured the use of two sections of
land on the Snoqualmie National for
est in connection with its forestry
courses.
A tool used to fight fires on the
California forests combines a rake,
spade and hoe. It is compact, so that
it can be carried on horseback, and
weighs less han 5 pounds.
In an increase in timber sales this
year and in in a decrease in receipts
from timber trespass as compared
jwith last year, national forest offi
jcers see a growing use of the forest
and respect for the federal forest pol
;icy. HARRY THAW MAKES ESCAPE
FROM MATTEAWAN ASYLUM.
By dashing throng the gate as the
milkman entered the Matteawan Asy
lum for the Criminal Insane at Mat
tawan, N. Y., Harry K. Thaw, slayer
of Stanford Allen, early Sunday morn
ing escaped. By an alleged pre
arranged plot a high-power automo
bile and a limousine, in which were
five men, were waiting in the road
ouside the asylum and whisked Thaw
away toward the Connecticut State
line. Nothing has been seen of him
since. He is supposed to have board
ed a waiting yacht and sailed for
Europe. In New York Mrs. Evelyn
Nesbit Thaw, since the escape of her
husband, is guarded by the police.
LITTLE THINGS COUNT.
Sometimes a very little thing leads
to very big results. As the story goes,
a few years ago one of the Express
companies charged Senator Sundzerg,
of Minesota, $32 for carrying a casting
for a threshing machine worth only
$2.50. The Senator looked upon it
as unwarranted extortion, which he
ought not to submit to quietly. He
started a fight against the company
and kept it up. The result has been
that the Interstate Commerce Com
mission has made a general order for
the reduction of expess charges
which, it is estimated, will take from
the profits of the various companies
$26,000,000 a year.
Chicago school teachers demand
wage increase aggregating $1,000,000

horses, are at Paris this week, taking
in the Bourbon fair, where they expect
to secure a big slice of the premi

ADD STOCK ' '..
As high as $15 .has been offered
for the growing crop of tobacco in sev
eral of the counties of .the Blue Grass,
but the growers are looking for a bet
ter price, as the crop will be short.
The crop in Bourbon will see the knife
within the next few days. In some
sections cutting will begin the latter
part of this week.
Mt. Sterling seems to be on the
hustle to revive the old time fair and
.racing. One of the best fairs in the
Estate took place in July and now a
move is on foot to hold fall trotting
and pacing meeting, some time in
September. A party of enthusiastic
horesmen are behind the move and of
course all adjoining counties will lend
any aid possible in order to make it a
success.
MARSHALL WILL APPOINT
DEMOCRATS AT OPPORTUNITY.
With the laying off for the summer,
while the distilleries arec losed, of,
nearly all of the gaugers, storekeepers
and storekeeper-gaugers in this inter
nal revenue district, the Democrats
who want to get into these places now
occupied by Republicans, have taken
on new hope.. As a result sixty-eight
applicants took the civil service exam
inations Saturday and Monday at Lex
ington in an effort to get on the eligi
ble list.
When a gauger or storekeeper is
laid off duing the summer the collector
of the district has the right to either
reasign them in the fall, when the dis
tilleries reopen, or to employ 'other
persons from the eligible list to the
places. Collector of Internal Revenue
Ben Marshall frankly says he intends
to appoint a Democrat every time he
gets a chance, and therefore there is a
rushe of the Democrats to get in the
eligible list.
NOTICE.
City tax lists for the
year 1913 are now in
my hands for collec
tion, at my office at
the Deposit Bank.

City Collector.
THE SLIT SKIRT BARRED.
Several hundred young women
stenographers and clerks employed
by a large manufacturing concern at
New Haven, Conn., received polite
notes in their envelopes this week,
with the warning that the slit skirts,
the hobble and diaphanous skirt aer
not to be tolerated. Each girl is
asked to appear for work in business
like and modest clothes.
Wood pulp imports into the United
States have grown from 112,500,000
pounds in 1901 to 1,080,000,000 pounds
last year, while British imports in
creased from 995,000,000 pounds to
2,073,000,000 pounds.

BURGLARS RAID CARLISLE
STOE; BLOODHOUNDS CALLED.
Following a series of burglaries that
have occurred in the neighboring town
of Carlisle, the. hardware store of
James Archdeacon & Son was entered
Sunday night. The thieves made off
with a large quantity of cartridges,
electric flash lights and knives. An
I effort was made to open the big safe
in thes tore, but failing in this they
(took their departure.
Capt. V. K. Millikin, of Lexington,
was called to that city with his blood
hounds and made the trip through this
city early Sunday morning in his auto
mobile. Capt. Mullikin returned late
in the afternoon after an unsuccess
ful attempt to trail the burglar. The
hound, however, took the 'trail near
the store, following it for some dis
tance where buggy tracks were found
which told how the burglars escaped.
Burglaries have been very numerous
in Carlisle in the past several weeks
and in spite of the efforts of the
police to apprehend the guilty parties
they have so far evaded detection.
From all reports it would seem that
the work ist hat of amateurs.

STATE SUES TO - .
RECOVER LARGE-SUM
The Farmers Bank, a State Treas
ury Depository under the administra
tion of State Auditor S. W. Hager, was
sued at Frankfort yesterday by the.
State of Kentucky "to collect $31,000
paid out to Assistant Auditor Judge t
Charles E. Booe, who wasconvicted
of the offense and served a term in the
penitentiary.
As a State deposftory the Farmers'
Bank gave to the State a personal
bond, amounting to several hundred
thousands of dollars. Judge Booe,
while Assistant Auditor, forged the
names of many persons to checks at
this bank, making a total of $31,000
which, it is alleged in the petition,
was not accounted for to the State.
The law in this State provides that
a bank is liable for the payment of
money on forged checks.
