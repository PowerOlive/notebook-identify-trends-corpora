WHEN WILL IT END?
It seejns that some automobilists
thoroughly beliBve that the streets
of Paris are authorized spedwaysj
kept in good repair for their es
pecial benefit. They travel so fast
tha one is prone to believe they
will be arrested and fined if jthey do
not average fifty miles .an hour.
Pleasant street, with its smooth
concrete surface is the' favorite play
ground of these speed demons. And
there seems to be no way of effect
ually stopping them from indulging
in their favorite pastime. A little
caution should be ejeercised in the
interest of humanity. Broken limbs
or necks cannot be remedied, but the
speed burning can be.
