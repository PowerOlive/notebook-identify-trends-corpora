Two Great Writers and "The Old
Nest"
"One. of the greatest of all stories
because its theme is the greatest
of all themes Life, and Life Now,
here, yours, mine.
"All bitter and sweet, and sad
and glad, and majestic, and petty
and divine and pitiful!
"A film story of life." Dr. Frank
Crane.
"The Old Nest" is real and touch
ing and almost incredbily without
an atom of false sentiment. I have
seen it four tmes and cried each
time." Alice Duer Miller.
Rupert Hughes' Heart Gripping Story of the Home
Suddenly they have all grown up and left her the babies she used to tuck in bed at
night. The ofd house is empty and silent. All have forgotten her. Her birthdays pass
unnoticed. Each child has embarked on a drama of his own. Loves, ambitions, tempta
tions carry them away. There are moments of laughter and comedy, romance, adventure,
tragedy. The story of their lives sweep you along. Your life your home your mother
as they might have been or as they are. "The Old Nest" will awaken deep in our heart
memories of mother to whom you ran with your childish troubles. Never before has the
screen touched with such beauty and dramatic fore a subject which finds an echo in the
lives of every one of us. One of the most heart gripping dramatic stories ever narrated.

Read What Lexington People Who Have Seen "The Old Nest Have to Say of this Remarkable Photoplay
"It is a wonderfful piece of art,
both in conception and in its pro
duction. It is full of humor and
tenderness. Iits pathos and tragedy
are never melodramatic, but such as
must touch the universal heart.
"I want every man, woman and
child in Paris to see it. None of us
are children of too old growth to
profit by it, though it may awaken
remorse. All young people owe it
to the mothers that bore them, to
learn the lesson 'The Old Nest' will
teach them, while yet there fs time
to go back to the old home once
more.
"And the photo-picture teaches a
most important lesson to mothers,
too, and fathers also, and warns
them against serious faults and
errors." Bishop Burton.
"If you wish a picture that ap
peals to the heart and the concence,
that awakens the love for mothers,
that because of business stress and
self interests, has long lain dormant,
in 'The Old Nest' you have it.
"As scene after scene is portray
ed, picturing never-failing mother
love, unconfined, ever-present, with
father by hen side to give of his
time, strength, tense with interest,
as the world old battle is waged
between waiting mothers and chil
dren's thoughtless neglect.
"The setting is perfect, empha
sizing the fact of mother's sacrifice,
children's neglect in every line. The
pathos brings tears, the finale,
heartease and smiles.
"Criticise, one cannot, for 'The
Old " Nest' is a wonderful picture,
wth setting flawless; the musical
score blending with the scenes, no
discords, all harmony. In its whole
some portrayal of life, it appeals to
the clergy as well as to layman,
youth as well as age. It quickens
the conscience of sins of omission
of mothers and the desire that re
unions in the old home nest, with
mothers enthroned as best beloved
be not neglected.
"See the picture. Words and pen
it is best, holding one's interest
from beginning to end. It s virile,
not weak, for it is life."
(Signed)
MRS. WM.
DOWBLL OLDHAM,
State War Mother.
"The chief lesson taught, "Don't
neglect mother, father can stand it,
but mother can't.
"Be sure to see it."
(Signed)
LUCY COLLIER.
President of Business and Profes
sional Woman's Club, of Lexington.
"It is the best, cleanest, most
wholesome pictuure I have ever
seen on the curtain.
"Every mother and child should
see it not once, but twice."
(Signed)
MRS. W. H. THOMPSON.
" 'The Old Nest' is a wonderful
message and will fill a need in call
ing to mind our duty to our moth
ers." (Signed)
