DRAFTEES TO BE OUT BY
JUNE 15.
Commanding generals of the north
eastern, eastern, southeastern and
central departments and of Camp
Knox, Bragg, Benning, Humphreys,
Eustis and Fort Sill, have been in
structed that it is the desire of the
War Department .to have discharged
by June 15, all men drafted or en
listed for the emergency who are
eligible for discharge.
The exception of the southern and
western departments from the order
was understood to be due to the fact
that the units under the supervision
of these departments are largely on
the Mexican border and that it there
fore might not be practicable to re
lease the men by June 15.
It was explained at the War De
partment that the men intended to
be affected by the order were those
whose services has been entirely
within' the United States and who
now are attached to "line organiza
tions of the regular service." Simi
lar instructions will be sent to com
manders of each of the 23 demobili
zation centers, but in their cases pre
vious orders regarding the discharge
of soldiers within 48 hours after the
arrival will be enforced.
- Commanders of demobilization
camps also were informed that in
discharging organizations sent to
them, all men coming from a given
city or community are as far as prac
ticable to be discharged on the same
day. This is to enable the men to
return in a body to their community
for such welcome as may be contem
plated for them.

"Don't Change Your Husband"
Which is the worst," a wife's uncombed hair or a husband's
unshaved face? Which would you rather see. a f aided kimono or
a coatless, bedraggled man? Cecil B. DeMille 'stripped the four
walls from married life" in "Old Wives for Newi" He's at it
again, but this time the husband "gets his." The man who
trimmed the market wouldn't trim his beard and it cost him
his wife. Don't neglect this great domestic drama. The splen
dor of the gowns is fully up to the DeMille standard that means
a veritable Fifth Avenue shop.

INTERESTING OIL NOTES
Co-operating Land & Development
Co. is actively engaged in drilling
severa leases, and it is reported that
the officers have gone to Allen, War
ren and Barren counties possibly to
purchase more properties for the
company.
The Lee-Kent Oil Co. has moved
into new offices at 514 Main street,
recently completed and furnished.
The furniture for the offices arrived
Thursday and was placed in "position
Friday. The new offices are admir
ably equipped and furnished for the
purpose.
Bourbon Oil & Development Co.
stock has been quiet for some time,
notwithstanding tlie fact that the
company is progressing rapidly with
its development. The company is
moving two rigs onto its 50 acres of
the Millie Freeman, Estill county,
lease, where it has three wells now.
Two wells are due on other leases.
W. C. Bell, Chas. P. Mann and Ira
Parks, of Paris, all prominent in
local oil circles, accompanied by a
delegation from Cynthiana, have re
turned from a six-hundred-mile mo
tor trip through fifteen counties in
Southern Kentucky. They report in
tense oil excitement at Scottsville,
and that some of the residents are
drilling wells in their back yards.
THE GOSPEL TRUTH.
One of our Paris business men re
cently remarked that he ran an ad
vertisement in THE NEWS last fall,
and that he saw no reason for spend
ing money for advertising.
Well, maybe he feels that way.
about it. But every time, he runs out
of a good seller he reorders. When
he goes to the table to eat a meal he
usually eats a good one, but do you
suppose he eats enough in one meal
to last a week? Hardly. Neither
does he eat enough in one week to
last a month, and we all know he
has something to eat. Wonder why
he doesn't try this once-a-year busi
ness on his meals? So it is with ad
vertising. No business man can ad
vertise enough in one week or one
month to last a whole year. It is the
persistent advertiser who gets re
sults. And it is THE BOURBON
NEWS that gets results for the ad
vertisers. Years have proved this.
"Now is the time to advertise!"
TO HOLD TENT MEETINGS.
Plans are being perfected to hold
farmers' community meetings in
about 60 counties in Kentucky dur
ing the summer. The money to
handle this big proposition is being
secured through the Board of Trade
of Louisville, and the Kentucky
Bankers' Association.
Neither of these organizations will
furnish any speakers for these meet
ings. The men and women who will
talk or do demonstration work, will
be furnished through the active co
operation of the University of Ken
tucky, the College of Agriculture, the
Experiment Station, the Extension
Division, the State Departments of
Education, Roads, Health and Agri
culture, the two Normal Schools and
the Departments at Washington.
These meetings are not experi
ments, as ten or twelve were held
several years ago, and scored an
unqualified success.
ABAS. BURLESON. ABAS!
The best news that has come from !
Postmaster-General Burleson recent
ly is that he will-relinquish control
of- the cables by May 10, and of the
telephone and telegraph lines as soon
as Congress can enact some necessary
legislation with reference to them.
And now if Mr. Burleson will re
linquish his hold on the postoffice de

down the public may forget, even if
it can never entirely forgive his de
linquencies. Abas, Bulreson, va

Washington became very enthusi

years after he secured "Royal Gift,"
his celebrated jack, from Spain. In
1788 he wrote his English friend,
Arthur Young, that mules were "a
very excellent race of animals."
Then he adds: "Indeed, in a few
years, I intend to drive no other in
my carriage, having appropriated for

FORMER PARIS WOMAN DROWN
ED IN SPENCER COUNTY
Mrs. Charles 'Owens, formerly of
near this city, was drowned while
fishing in a stream near her home in
Spencer county. Mrs. Owens and
some friends were fishing, she being
a short distance from the rest of the
party. The fishing rod she was using
had been stuck in the bank of the
creek, and in stepping over to lift it
up, she lost her balance and fell in
the water, drowning before help
could reach her.
The body was brought to this city
and buried in the Paris Cemetery at
1:30 o'clock, yesterday afternoon,
with services conducted by Rev. W.
E. Ellis, pastor of the Paris Chris
tian church. Mrs. Owens and her
husband formerly resided on the
Brophy farm, on the North Middle
town pike, near Paris.
SAVE FUEL FROM THE LOG
HEAPS.
Look forward to next winter's sup
ply of wood. In many parts the old
time custom still prevails of burning
valuable cordwood in log heaps fol
lowing the clearing up of new land.
Thousands of farmers must provide
themselves with wood for next win
ter. J
If the farmer can not use the wood
himself some neighbor, school house
or church will likely be glad to get
it when cold weather comes. Much
wood apparently useless at this time
of the year, will be wasted unless
forethought is exercised. Postpone
burning your waste wood.

MOVEMENT TO START Y. M. C. A.
CLUBS IN HIGH SCHOOLS
The establishment of High School
Y. M. C. A. clubs in the high schools
of the Buiegrass and the announce
ment of schedules for camps at Dan
iel Boone, the State Y. M. C. A. camp
on the Kentucky River, featured the
conference of twenty high school
superintendents and principals and a
number of Y. M. C. A. workers held
Saturday at the Phoenix Hotel, in
Lexington.
The object of the meeting was to
interest the principals and the super
intendents of the Bluegrass in the Y.
M. C. A. work among the boys in the
high schools, and to establish High
"Y" clubs in the county and city
schools. The Lexington high schools
were the first in the State to try this
plan and have found it most success
ful. Maysville and Cynthiana fol
lowed with equally satisfactory re
sults, and now all the high schools of
Central Kentucky will establish sim
ilar clubs. The representatives also
agreed to send a suitable number of
leading students of their respective
schools to the boys' training camp at
Camp Daniel Boone, Aug. 25-Sept. 1.
Lexington high school has pledged to
send seven representative students
and one leader.
Among those who attended the
conference were Mr. Z. L. Wilcox,
Secretary of the Bourbon County Y.
M. C. A., and Prof. Marion Roberts,
principal of the Little Rock Graded
High School.

the George Washington so he could
