Mrs Elizabeth Kpbins Pennelllcxn
tributes to The Century an article on
Play In London After speakiMgaf
Vauxhall Gardens and CremornMr
Pennell says
Everybody Knows rno
den was like Thackeray has seen to
that with the hundred thousand gamps
always lighted the fiddlers whomade
ravishing melodies the singersythe
dancers the Mme Saquis on thejslack
rope ascending to the stars the herinit
walks so favorable to lovers the pots of
stout the dinners and suppers rrin a
word the sort of combination of cafe
music hall restaurant and Fourth of
July that nowhere else has been brought
to such perfection that to Sir Roger
country cousin but every summer
Earls court has its exhibition ranex
hibitibn only by courtesy only out of
deference to the present fashion ofgath
ering our kuowledge or pretending to
while we play One year it was galled
Italian and there were macaroni saud
chianti in the restaurants and amice
new pasteboard forum Another year
it was German and the air was heavy
with the fragrance of schnitzel and
wurst Then it was Americanfbr a
change and cowboys aud red Indians
swaggered across the scene and Eoda
water and maple
menu Now it
with a fine oriental flavor but by the
time this is published it will be some
thing else and it really matters very
little The exhibition attributed to jury
nation would be as gay Nqbody cares
save perhaps a few tradesmen and
mummers who smell the commercial
battle from afar It is an open secret
that the semblance of a show is there
merely to court avoidance The years
in passing have turned it into a big
bazaar but not even in this guise can it
prove the chief attraction
tnat counts is tne garden wnere one
may walk under pleasant trees where
one may ape the continental and drink
tea or coffee at little tables but most
ly tea in capacipus jpots to the accom
paniment of thick slabs of cakejhere
one may be still more un English Tand
eat ones dinner outdoors not llke a
wild beast in a cage as in the old
box at Vauxhall but in company
on a low broad veranda where there
are side shows more diverting than
Pepys ever dreamed of where one may
loaf away the summer evening listen
ing to music which is at least asgood
as the honest Briton likes it For the
truth is the garden furnishes just that
form of amusement which Mr Henry
James has lamented was not jto be
found in London and so long as it is
open one need not as he thought give
up the idea of going to sit somewhere in
the open air to eat an ice and listen to
a band of music Only the amusement
must be shared with so big a Sprowd
that one will have to scramblefor a
chair engage a dinner table full 12
hours beforehand and struggletto get
home by underground or bus as furi
ously as the mob fights to push into the
pit of a popular theater
To provide the Englishman jvith a
crowd to give him the chance to use
his elbows is to convince him that he
is enjoying himself And the- old gar-
dens questionable features its reVelers
its jockeys and courtesans and gam
blers where are they Where are the
snows of yesteryear All goue with
other times and other morals The
world of Earls court and Kenlington
has taken the exhibition under its pro
tection and there sits in stately splen
dor a magnificent example of
bility within an inclosure humorously
mission is refused to all but the elect
