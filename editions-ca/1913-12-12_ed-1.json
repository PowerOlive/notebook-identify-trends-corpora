i Mrs. Parker since before supper Mon
day, and they thought perhaps she
was away from the building. The
bed in the bedroom showed that she
had been lying down, and some fancy
work was lying beside her. It was
presumed that she was taken ill on
Tuesday morning, and in an effort to
summon assistance had gotten up
from he bed and made her way half
across the room when she was seized
by death, which probably ensued at
least twelve hours before the body
was discovered.
Mrs. Parker was formerly Miss Ma
mie Gillespie, daughter of Mr. Robert
Gillespie, of Falls Mills, Va. She was
united in marriage to Mr. Parker in
1S96, and a year later came to Paris,
where they have since resided. She
was a member of the Christian
church and a most popular and at
tractive woman. During her resi
dence in Paris Mrs. Parke'r had made
many friends who will be grieved to
learn of ier death.
Besides her husband and father she
is survived by three sisters, Mrs. Har
ry Baldwin, of Bourbon county; Mrs.
Charles Boiling, of Maysville; and
Mrs. Jas. Baldwin, of Falls Mills,
Va. Also by one brother, Mr. T. S.
Gillespie, of North Fork, West Va.
