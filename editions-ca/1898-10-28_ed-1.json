Waiters and Waitresses
Talking of waitresses a New York
hotel keeper says that although they
may possess some superior qualities for
such service there are on the other
hand such drawbacks as make it cer
tain that they would never be accept
able to the majority of men who would
have to be served by them He says
I think the objection to them would
be based chiefly on the fact that they
never show especial attention to any
person I never knew a woman who
waited on a man to trouble herself in
the least about the manner in which
she served him It makes absolutely no
difference whether they receive liberal
tips or not They may be quiet neat
and quick but they would never pick
out one piece of beef because it was
batter than another or make any effort
to get the best of what was to be had
in the kitchen That sort of attention
makes a man worth his fee to the men
who tip him
It is this special service that makes
a waiter superior to the best of his as
sociates Women never detect any dif
ference between the quality of one dish
and another They are all the same
and good service requires merely that
they shall be set down noiselessly and
brought quickly There the service of
the waitress ends She can beat any
man at those features of the business
But she cannot select for him anything
better than the rest of the customers
get Usually she does not notice any
difference in them That deficiency is
the safeguard of the waiter and will
keep his place secure for him
A German Word Serpent
A German correspondent comes to the
rescue of his countrymen concerning
whom we expressed surprise that they
should prefer to use a word of four syl
lables when another word expressing
the same thing in 40 syllables was
available He sends us a copy of The
Kolnische Volkszeitung in which oc
curs a sentence of 607 words occupy
ing 69 lines of the newspaper
This word serpent occurs in a legal
judgment and even the printers got to
hate it after setting up about 450 words
of it So they put in a full stop which
like a rifle bullet in the spine of a boa
constrictor killed the whole sentence
But it must really be nice to have news
papers in which you can begin to read
a sentence at breakfast continue it in
the train and triumphantly reach the
verb at office London Globe
Warding Off Jealousy
Old Gotrocks savagely Whats
that You mean to tell me that you
really love my daughter for herself

Young Hardup tremulously Y yes

Gooseberries on Trees
Travelers in Burma see many strange
things and perhaps one of the strangest
is the way in which some kinds of fruit
grow
For instance gooseberries that at
home grow on small bushes in this part
of the world grow on trees over 25 feet
high They are not a soft pulpy fruit
but are as hard as marbles
The real Burman grapes also grow
on high trees and not on vines They
hang from the branches and trunk of
the tree in clusters on a long stalk and
are covered with a thick outer skin
which cannot be eaten
The cachou or monkey nut is also
peculiar and consists of a large juicy
fruit of soft pulp with its nut or kernel
attached to the outside of the fruit at
the end farthest from the stalk from
which it hangs London Standard

r Government Money
At close of our Civil War in 1865J
there appeared in the London Times
the following
If that mischievous financial pol
icy which had its origin in the North
American Republic during the late
Civil War in that country should be
come indurated down to a fixture
then that government will furnish its
mopey without cost It will have all
the money that is necessary to carry
on its trade and commerce It will
become prosperous beyond precedent
in the history of civilized nations of
the world The brain and wealth of
all countries will go to North America
THAT GOVERNMENT MUST BE
DESTROYED OR IT WILL DE
STROY EVERY MONARCHY ON
THIS GLOBE

The tamous Hazzard circular to
capitalists in New York andtheJBuell
Bank circular to United States Bank
ers both emanating from London and
the fabulous corruption fund raised in
England and Germany estimated at
1500000 were the agents that se
cured the closing of our mints against
silver
The walk into my parlor- policy
of England during and since the
Spanish War is the latest evidence
of English Diplomacy in shaping the
destiny of the United States Govern
ment
Notwithstanding the famine price
of wheat the Spanish War and fabu
lous expenditures of money by our
government during the past year gold
has increased in value eleven rjer cent
and all other values decreased in the
same proportion
For a thorough understanding of
the money question or silver issue
the Cincinnati Enquirer has uniformly
given evidence of its ability to teach
explain and produce all facts and
truth It is a paper that ought and
can be read by all classes with pleas
ure and profit
