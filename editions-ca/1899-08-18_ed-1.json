Scrofula is the most obstinate of blood
troubles and is often the result of an
inherited taint in the blood S S S
is the only remedy which goes deep
enough to reach Scrofula it forces out
every trace of the disease and cures
the worst cases
My son Charlie was afflicted from infancy
with Scrofula and he suffered so that it was
impossible to dress him
for three years His
head and body were a
mass of sores and his
eyesight also became
affected No treatment
was spared that we
thought would relieve
him out he grew worse M

we gave him S S S

cided improvement was the result and after
he had taken a dozen bottles no one who knew
of his former dreadful condition would have
recognized him All the sores on his body
have healed his skin is perfectly clear ana

How a V7is3 Brahman
Taught a Beautiful
Lsson
rM mJ vt iS ft f
To an nncient pious Brahman was n
fCrandson horn Full of joy it the bless
ag which hail agniri happened to his
bouse he said I will ir out hence and
thank the great spirit and father of na
ture who has blessed us Perhaps he
may give me opportunity to honor him
even through one good deed
So spoke the Brahman and went The
blossom of pore joy is gratitude and its
fruit henovolence
With the lively feeling of honoring the
great and beneficent spirit the old man
stepped into the helds and in the shade
of the
prayer
trees each of his thoughts was a
Still sparkled the drops of a
fleshly fallen shower on stalks blossoms
and leaves
Although he had already seen the
spring 90 times nature seemed to him
again made young and fairer than ever
for she grows not old to him who re
veres her creator and recognizes in the
figure the benevolent sculptor
The old man set on his way forward
and on the beaten path he found ail
acorn The rain had already through its
fertilizing power sent the germ forth
and the shell hurst asunder hut it could
not take root on the hard hare path He
stooped took it up and said
llow charming it is to he brought thus
far on my way for easily hadst thou
been trodden in pieces by the foot of the
wanderer or withered bj the solar rays
Happy shall I be if I can here do a good
work and by deed fulfill my inward sen
timent and the aim of wise nature ad
ranee who with each breath shows a
benefit even the smallest thankfulness
is a sweet duty
A youngster who stood behind the oak
tree and who had caught up the words
of the Brahman stepped forward and
jceringly smibd
Why smiist thou asked the old
man
The youngster answered At thy child
ish thought my elder that thou canst
rejoice at having rescued the life of an
acorn f
Youngster said the Brahman how
art thou able to know my thoughts since
today is the first time thou hast seen meV
And why dost thou jeer at the small
service which I intend to perform to na
ture To her is the acorn worth as much
as the tree and witht this were
not Even virtue m with
the little and from this mounts upward
to the great but the nearer she ap
proaches to the completion of tne original
even so much the more she herself in
clines to humility and simplicity and
then to her is worth the smallest as
much as the highest Sends not Brahma
too his ray and dew on the blade of
grass as well as on the palm tree
Thus spoke the old man with friendly
seriousness The youngster silently with
drew himself full of veneration He had
seen the noble old man in his dignity
and he wished to be like him for frivol
ity itself must in its heart revere virtue
The Brahman set forward on his way to
a hill which was overgrown round about
with thorns He met a peddler who ask
ed Thinkest thou that out of an acorn
thou canst rear a tree for thyself Thou
wilt indeed scarcely have the joy of its
shade
The old man answered Must one at
the planting think only on the shade of
the tree and on oneself Does nature
so My sou he who has not planted
earlier than and before yesterday finds
in the planting itself his motive and his
joy
He came to the hill on the peak of
which among the thorns he buried the
acorn and covered it carefully over with
earth and moss
Why plantest thou among thorns
called out a herdsman opposite to him
Thou carest badly for thy nursling
Friend replied the Brahman so
long as the little plant is tender aiid small
the thorns will shelter it from raw winds
and injury and when it grows up it will
work a way through for itself for it i
an oak Ify son 1 have obtained this of
nature The good mother considers equal
ly the tenderness aiid strength of her fos
ter children
After the old man had completed his
work ne trod gayly on the way back to
his homestead A he drew near to his
hut his grandsons and great grandsons
sprang toward him and asked Where
hast thou been so long
But he assembled them around him and
recounted all whim had happened to hi
and the little children caressed the old
man while ke spoke Tke elder one sjj
ever nuug on nis lips and barkened to
him
Oh said the old man when he had
finished there is certainly no place fair
er than in the lap of natvre when the
father loves his offspring at m the quiet
circle of his family is beloved by his chil
dren Yes love abounding Brahma
cried he and glanced upward to heaven
in the quiet circle of nature and of do
mestic peace stands thy holy temple
The new planted oak soon grew forth
out of the germ and raised itself up
above the thorns and became a spreading
shady tree There died the old man and
his loved ones buried him on the hill and
whenever they saw the tree and heard its
rustlings they were mindful of the life
and wise sayings of rhe Brahman even to
the latest times and recited from him
and sought to become like him for the
word of a wise man is as a grain of corn
in fruitful ground Boston Ulobe
Imagery of the Malay Lansnaee
The stutiy of the Malay language is
commended by a writer iu The Popular
Science Monthly who says it is easily
learned and has much to repay for learning
It is replete with
ing wonders and sur
prises Malay among other things being
the home of euphemism where a spade
is called anything but a spade For in
stance to die is beautifully expressed in
Malay as a return to the mercy of Allah
A neighbor is one whom you permit to
ascend the ladder of your cottage and
your friend is a sharer of your joys and
sorrows Interest is the flower of mon
ey a spring is an eye of water the sun
the eye of day and a policeman all eyes
A walk is a stroll to eat the wind a man
drunk is one who rides a green horse a
coward a duck without spurs and a flat
