as officially reportedhave been limited during the last 24hours to an occasional exchange ofshots between the insurgents and thetroops forming the lines of Jen Law-HalL extending from thewater works to La Lonia But thisshooting has been just active enough tomake the lives of the soldiers a burdenand to eompel the officers to sleepin trenches clothed and in readinessto resist possible attacks Most of theAmericans are becoming convincedthat the backbone of the insurgent opposition is broken There are numerous rumors pointing to an early collapse of the insurrection- One of theseis that Gen Pio Del Pilar the bestfighter among the Filipino officers willdesert Aguinaldo and give his supportto the AmericansThe Spaniards reasoning from theirexperience of the natives refuse to believe that the rebellion is anywherenear put down They declare that theFilipinos will not take their defeat atMalolos with the loss of the city andthe removal of their so called government seriously to heart On thecontrary the Spaniards predictthat the insurgents will hovernear the American lines botheringthem as much as possible and whenattacked in force dissolve only to reappear at other points This sort oftactics the Spaniards say will be followed until the wet season compels theAmericans to be housed in barracksand then the Filipinos will return andreoccupy such towns as the UnitedStates troops do not garrison With thenext dry season a repetition of thepresent operations will begin Timealone will show how much there is inthis theory but as against it it mustbe borne in mind that the Spaniardsin all their domination of the Philippines never gave the inhabitants ademonstration of power comparablein effectiveness to that given them bythe United StatesStruck a HurricaneQuekxstown April 3 The

I mean without waitinghalf a lifetimeWhy in that ease I answered notquite sure what he would be at thematter would stand in another lightLook yon he said rounding uponme then and speaking in a brisker tonethan he had before I have a mind tomake ou a proposition I am in wantof a second mate So we can agreeupon terms what say you to the placeJt is a little better beginning than abare berth before the mast with theChance of bettermentI could see the thing closing in uponme as it were yet hardly knew how toevade it and on the whole began tocare less o do so Well captain 1finally answered I cannot see why Ishould decline such a kindly and timelyoiler I agree providing 1 hat I am ableto fulfill all your requirements whichI somewhat doubt seeing that my experience has been but briefHe called for the score which he insisted upon paying and we left the innThere was a good deal of confusiona long the docks for several of the kingsships were fitting for sea and the running about and pulling and hauling allwithout much method or precisionwere stiprising and perplexing but atlast we reached the jetty where the captains boat was lying Ob the way itsuddenly occurred to me that I had neglected to ask a pretty important question which was the port that the Industry the captains ship was bounofor I asked it now and learned thatit was Havana in the West Indies Thinsuited me very well as I had never beenin those parts and had a young fellowsfondness for novelty We boarded thegig which a middle aged sailor waskeeping and were soon clear of thetangle of shipping about the docks andstanding into the roadstead I suspected that one of the three large vessels that were at anchor some littledistance out might be the Industry andaccordingly asked the captainAye quite right he answered pointing to the easternmost of the shipsglimpse through an open gang portof a shape in a tarpaulin which couldhardly be other than a long range gunThe whole appeared to show that shewas fitted to fight as well as to fiywhich was passing needful in thosetroublesome times Her burthen as 1afterward learned was 10 tons and aswe approached her and she flashed upher great black side she looked evenlarger As we drew near some headsshowed above the bulwark and 1 madeout a ladder hanging ever at that placeWe pulled up to it and when we rose onthe next wave the sailor reached out aboat hook and steadied lis to it andwe were speedily up the sideAs I glanced about taking in thefashion of the deck and such arrangements as had not been visible from thewater a short broad man in a kindof Dutch blouse and heavy sea bootscame from some place forward and accosted the captain 1 inferred that hemust be the mate and so indeed itproved and upon being presented Ifound his name was liles Sel lingerand that he hailed from SouthamptonHe had a resolute honest looking countenance albeit the smallpox had pittedhim rather severely and 1 thought hadthe air of a good seaman and competent officer The captain explained themeaning of my being aboard and saidthat he doubted not I should suit themwell though it might be 1 should haltin some things at the beginning Master Sellinger received this explanationin a wav favorable to my prideWe made no further delay but returned to the town and at the hour appointed to be fetched off f was readclothes bag in hand The tide hadfallen since morning and I had to walkto the edge of the jetty before I couldespy the boat which I then perceived atthe foot of the long flight of wet stepsThe two sailors who were t he crewwere alone in her and so I saw that 1was beforehand with my companionsI waited a few moments talking withthe sailors but not too freely lest theyconceive me an easy sort which wouldnot do and presently 1 heard the voiceof the captain The sailors pushed thebeat more fairly to the foot of thestairs and directly the captain appeared at the topAye Master Ardick is here I heardhim say back to someone behind himand almost with the words the personhe had addressed joined him Thesupercargo for such of course the second man was 1 found to be a nimbleerect little gentleman in age perhapsCO with some gray in his beard buta good fresh skin and dressed veryhandsomely in sad colored velvet lowcrowned hat with feathers yellow hoseand high heeled French shoes withblue rosettes His head was coveredwith a fashionable flowing wig and hisbroad sword belt supported a good substantial sword with a silver hiltAs soon as Capt Ilouthwiek had putus on our course he presented me tothe supercargo giving his name as MrTym and informing him with somelittle pride that he would find me other than the common sort of sailor being a man of considerable parts and ofa family above the ordinary my fatherhaving been an owning shipmaster andthe son of a justice of the peace and mymother the daughter of a knightAfter a somewhat tedious pull thewind being in part contrary and quitea sea beginning to run we drew nearand I got up and made ready to seizethe ladder It was of rope with woodenrungs the top and bottom made fastand presently I succeeded in catchingit and drew the bow of the boat as nearas was safe The ship rose and sankand churned about in a troublesomefashion but I managed to hold on andfirst the captain and then Mr Tympaaacd me and swung over to the ladderThe old supercargo was as steady andsure footed as a rope dancer and it immediately occurred to me that he mightbe a veteran seagoer a conclusionwhich was confirmed as I saw how coolly he waited on the ladder till thetain was out of the way though theship was rolling and pitching and sending frothing flings of water up to thevery soles of liis dainty shoes In a moment the captain had passed over thebulwark and Mr Tym began to follow and it was then that I made a surprising discover- I had noticed thaithe old fellow had kept his cloak partly about him and I had marveled at itas the day was so warm but now as hebegan to climb the wind caught thegarment and blew it out and beholdhe had lost his left hand The sleevehung loose and long about the wristand out of the draock showing queeramong the lace peepeffof an iron hook He caught this overthe rungs of the ladder alternatingJ with his right hand and without anydimcuity mounted the unsteady sideand swung himself lightly over thebulwark This lively breeze was a fairone for our sails and we must all needslook alive and walk up the anchor andget the Industry under canvasThe captain mounted the poop aman was sent to the tiller and the matestatioaed himself just abaft the forecastle to pass the word alongHeave her short shouted the captain Heave her short repeated themate and the pawls of the windlass began to rattleLoosen sail followed and the mensprang into the rigging Everythingwas cleared to let go and all handsexcept a man on each yard to stay thebunt scampered back to the deckAll ready aloft hailed the mateAll read answered the fellows onthe jardsLet go and the ship flashed outwhite and stood clothed in the waves ofloose canvas Then the chief topsailswere set the yards trimmed and theanchor finally brought to a head Shesteadied quickly to her work and asshe climbed away the light canvas wasrapidly put outIn a short time the watches were appointed and the business of putting theship in order and other like things of thebeginning of a voyage attended to andafter that I had a little breathing spaceand slipped down to my cabin I had asmall berth in the aftermost part of thetween decks and here I found myclothes bag and other effects and proceeded to sling a hammock preferringit to either of the bunks the berth contained and sat down to have a briefsmokeMy smoke over I strolled for a bit intothe forecastle and then went again ondeck where I found the wind rathergathering strength and quite a stiff searunning We reefed the topsails andby that time supper was called Therest of the evening passed without incident I turned in early as my watchwas to be called at eight bells andwhen the time came crawled outmighty sleepy but full of zeal and sokept my four hours At daylight allhands had to bQ called as there was aheavy wind which was verging on halfa gale and we whipped down the mainsail and the great lateen and beforewe were done had to be satisfied witha reefed main topsail a bit of foresailand a reefed sprit topsailMarry but this is something boisterous for the narrow seas said ahigh pit died voice behind me as Istood holding on by the lashings of thebig gun and watching the turmoilI turned and saw the little supereat go who had just come out of thecabin lie was balancing himself fearlessly on his straddled legs a long seacoat whipping about him and his handclapped upon his hat to keep both thatand his great curly wig from blowingawayAvesir I said thi isIJlroughweather for the channelI saw worse once he shouted witha kind of chuckle and then-xI saw I was beforehand with my companionsly sucking in his lips which I foundwas a way he hadAnd how was that 1 asked willing to forget the weather for a moment if I couldWhy it was a matter of above 20years ago he replied Things so fellout with me on that occasion that Iput to sea on a day even worse thanthis in only a small fishing sloopIt was beyond account rash 1commented It must have been astrait indeed to bring you to itIt was to save my neck he answered i peaking this time close to myear that he might talk with less strainYou see it was in the days of oldNoll and I had ventured into my native Sussex I had forgotten to saythat the old tyrant had set a price onmy head and was forced to get speedily out Luckily a fellow royalist wasat hand and lent me a horse and onthat I reached the seaside and thenceboarded this fisherman upon which Iput out as I saidBut I he master of her I querieda little puzzled by that point in thestory how did you prevail on him totake such a riskHow Why to be sure with a pistol at the head He would listen nootherwiseind the crew Had von no troublewith themWay not a whit I did but point another pistol at them I had two handsin those days and became mosttractableYou deserved to escape I criedadmiringly But what then Didyou come to close straits before youmade the other sideYes he answered shaking hishead and at last we had to cut awathe mast It is too long to dwell tiponbut the wind up was we finally madeFrance It was hard by Calais and wehad started from Eastbourne Therewas much tedious pumping to do andright slow progress under such sail aswe could put upon a jury mastIs not that a sail out yonder Hebroke off and pointed to a white speckthe black turn l on the northwestern seaboard whichf iuung witn such steadiness that I soondecided that it was indeed a sail Itwas nothing surprising or unexpectedof course here in the channel and Igave no more heed to it at the timeMr Tym shortly retired again to thecabin and the hard weltering of theship through the heavy seas went onThe forenoon wore away and it wasabout seven bells when happening tothink of the sail I had seen I went totherailtolook for it It was now abouton the lee bow and much nearer andsoon I could make out a large shipclose hauled on the starboard tack Icontinued to watch her and presentlyI saw that she had altered her courseand was now steaming directly towardus I happened to glance toward thepoop where the captain and mate werestanding and saw that the skipperwas pulling out and pointing his glassHe took a long observation and thento my surprise shook his head energetically and passed the glass to themate Sellinger looked in turn and almost at once lowered the instrumentand began bawling something in thecaptains ear Houthwick answeredby a nod and ttirned sharply and rana little way aft He gave a commandI could not tell what to the man atthe helm and rapidly returned anddescended the poop ladder The matefollowed stopping at the bottom tohang the glass in some beckets andcame to the confines of the quarterdeck Ilouthwiek oi the other handturned short at the companion whichhe opened and from a strap just inside took out his trumpet He madeno stop but scurried out to the ladderagain and went up with long eagerstrides the pace faster than I had everobserved him tise before He was notyet at the top when the mate roaredto me using his hand to guide thesoundCall all handsTO RE CONTINUEDWRECK OF

suitors wan on the boatthat day and he and Fannie cribbedand confined as it were in one cornerof a deserted quarfer of the deck thetwins were out of range for once andhe thought he was making good head-waywf - -ut really in her heart Fannie wasdespising him for a fop his immaculate clothes came first she thoughth viands next probably and lastlywith what little was left of him hischaracterThat particular day he walked uphi- avenue of approach undisturbedby bark of dog or remark of twin Hewas nearer the delectable mountainsthan ever before he realized and hisheart thumped madly against his irreproachable waistcoat as he openedhis mouth to ask the decisive questionJust at that moment a shrill screampierced the sultry July air Then ahtJrrying and scurrying of feet washeard Instantly a ray of knowledgela shed its way into Fannies brainOne of the twins is overboard shesaid to herself as she sped down thenear stairs and along the lower deckJust a- she reached the bow of theboa sic saw a little kiit drawn inby the suction of the water betweenthe barge on which most of the excursionists were embarked and theboat that drew it Another momentand the same little skirt and a childsface half hidden in her long wet hairwas borne bv the swift waters out anddow n the riverSome one clung to the mother whowanted to leap after her child LittleStic was wailing and Fannie wringing her hands and

command he leapedfrom the pilot house down into thewater and stuck out after the darkspot that was quite distant nowThe man was well along on his waywhen the crowd of passengers whowere straining their eyes down theriver saw the dark something on thesurface of the water sinkThe mother uttered a cry and wasborne half fainting into the nearestcabin Fannies face was white andstrained but -she

Hands andthe HairWomen with pretty hands usuallytak better care of them than thotethat are not blessed Hov er mostany womavi can escape having attention drawn to the fact that her handsare rot especially beautiful by takingcare of them and making them as presentable as possible In the first placein order to make them limber a wordyou know that is the first cousin tograce the fingers should be exercisedevery day by doubling them up to afist then opening thena aid stretchingthem out as far as possible Repeatthis movement one hundred timescounting three each time the fingerschange positionAt night the hands should be soakedin very warm soap suds made frompure castile or olive oil soap Afterthis they should be carefully dried using almond meal or oatmeal to renderhi m velvety Then they should berubbedi very thoroughly with lanolineThis can be bought in bulk at the drugstores in whatever quantity is desiredor it can be bought in preparationwhich is a better way to use it Lanoline is pronounced by physicians to bea pure and excellent skin food After1 his is rubbed in the hands should be inserted in a loose pair of kid gloves overnight In the morning wash care fullyand dry with almond meal Of courseit is not necessary to rub in the lanolineevery night of ones life After thehands are once put in condition it isnot difficult to keep them soThe skin about the nails shoold bepressed well back using a dull instrument that will not cut nor irritate itThe crescent at the bottom of the nailgauges the distance at which the skinshould be pressed back as this shouldalways be in si htA jrood recipe for makinsr rouirh orhard hands soft and also for whiteningthem is to take one cake of tallowthree inches- square one cake of beeswax one inch square and a piece of camphor gum the size of a hickory nutMelt and mix When cool rub on thehands using plenty of it draw on apair of gloves for the night This isalso excellent for chapped handsWhy how awfully thin your hair isgetting Every now and then somesupposedly helpless woman hears thatre mar I addressed to her She looksup in a defeated kind of way andi sa s1 know it is but I dont know what todo about itThe difficulty usually lies not somuch in the fact that she cannot helpherself but that she neglects to to soThis is a deplorable mistake as nothing addis so much to a womans beautyas a lovelv coiffure in fact some womenalmost gain a reputation for beingbeautiful solely because cf itTn the first place great care shouldjjS taker n the 4stntpoo Vhvit no injurious ingredients are used and alsothat the hair is dried in the sun fanneddry or at least by a process that doesnot scorch it Drying quickly by greatheat is ruinous Then too it must beremembered that a shampoo mixturethat is excellent for a Wonde may bevt rv bad for a brunette For instanceordinal v washing soda dissolved in thewater is good for very light hair Itdoes not take the life out of it as doesperoxide of hydrogen it bleaches itjust slightly It costs but a few centsa pound and if not used too Btrong ISnot injurious However it can easilybe seen that this would not do at allfor a brunette as it would fade the hairIf the hair is split at the ends it shouldbe cut off tin inch or two as the splitting shows that the roots are not ableto nourish its full lengthBrushing the hair is excellent lor itand essential for its life and

our state but one of them hasthe nerve to say so over his own signature in the newspapers said Mr FR Graham a leading business man ofDurango Col to a Washington PostreporterAs I do not aspire to office there isno reason for timidity on my part andI unhesitatingly declare that the experimi it of giving the ballot to womenin Colorado has been as rank a pieceof foolishness as any people ever inflicted upon themselves it has done avrrviti ic 1 rieiithe elections cleaner but I contendthat they appropriate credit that doesrot belong to them for while theelections are better conducted thanformerly the improvement is due tothe Australian system and not to thewomenThe presence of women in conventions and political meetings is to mymind degrading to them Surroundedby a lot of coarse men whom theywould not elevate or refine in a lifetime they are entirely out of their element Their vote in no way conducesto better government than if they werewithout the franchise for they vote
