Saturday.Vehement criticism of the Wisconsin Senator and his own defense occupying virtually the entire day,marked the close of the war sessionwith other customary adjournmentand legislative procedures includingPresident Wilson's attendance at theCapitol. The usual eleventh hourgrist of legislation was put through,following six months of importantar action, and to-night most of themembers who had remained for thefinal day were enroute home to awaitthe call of the next session December 3.The halls of Congress have probably never -before heard such scathing criticism of a United States Senator as that which fell from the lipsof Senators to whom unalloyed patriotism had been inherited from theirforefathers. LaFollette was unmercifully held up to the merited scorn ofthe America people in bitter vitrolic? peeches by Senators Kellogg, of Minliesota, Fall, of New Mexico, and Robjnson, of Arkansas, who declared itwould be a shame to mention evenBenedict Arnold in the same breathtv-ifh T.aFollette. wnom evenschool children were beginning "oknd congratulated them upon theirshame and point the finger of scornas the arch-traitor of America."LaFollette replied with a threehour speech in his own defense, butit will never strike the people ofAmerica as being more than a weakapology for having "given aid andcomfort to the enemy."Senator Kellogg, of Minnesota, andFall, of New Mexico, Republicans,and Robinson, of Arkansas, Democrat, replied with criticism of Mr.LaFollette's public statements. Theydenounced what they termed his unpatriotic stand, Mr. Robinson statingthat if he held such opinions hewould seek a place in the GermantBundesart. Statements accreditedto the Wisconsin member in his St.Paul speech were flatly contradicted,especially that regarding former Secretary of State Bryan's knowledge ofammunition being on the Lusitaniabefore she sailed on her fatal voyage., ft B WPROSECUTIONS AGAINST GAMELAW VIOLATERS.Prosecutions in cases worked up bySpecial Game Warden Bush Bishop,of Paris, in Madison county, have resulted in stiff fines being assessedagainst- game law violators in thatcounty r ..- - . ,Some time ago Warden -Bishopmade a special trip' to Madisoncounty" where lie placed M. W. Anderson of Woodford county, underarrest on a charge of hunting without a license. In tne County Courta fine of ?15 and costs was marked-up against Anderson. The latter hadWarden Bishop arrested on a cliargeof tresspassing. When the case wastried Bishop was promptly discharged. Another charge against Anderson for-trespassing was dismissed onthe ground that he was acting asagent for the owner of the land,Mrs. Chenault.The -case of Warren Stoner, formerParisian, who was arrested by WarrlPTi Bishon. at Olympian Springs.charged with killing doves out of.season, and another charge or usingabusive and provoking language toward Warden Bishop, were also tried.A fine of ?25 and costs was assessedon the first charge, while the second case was continued until Oct. 16,on account of absence of importantwitnesses whose testimony wasneeded.Warden Bishop arrested Thos.Curtis, Charles Curtis and ThomasArbuckle near, Richmond last Friday,charged with hunting without alicense. Their cases will be heard inthe Madison County Court to-morrow.The law-abiding sportsmen of Madison are giving their hearty supportto Warden Bishop, and telling himto enforce the law regardless of whoit hurts.106 IdSTORAGE MANUALS RECEIVED. a lnrjrp hnndle of storage manualsissued by the National Food GardenCommission at Washington in thefood conservation campaign, has beenreceived in Paris by Miss JmogeneRedmon, Librarian at the Paris Public Library, for distribution in thefood conservation campaign.These, manuals are intended forfree distribution.

Every woman in the countryis asked to register during that weekfor whatever service she feels shecan render her country in this greatcrisis of its history. We have beenused to boasting of the splendid loyalty of our women, and we have always had whereofJx boast. Thus fariD the present conflict their responseto the calls made on them has beenspontaneous and most gratifying.But greater demands yet will bemade. Their work is in no sense inferior to that of the men, although itmay differ very materially from itin the element of "thrill." They willbe called on to take up and bearwoman's age-old burden patient endurance and helpful ministration.That their response will be evenmore enthusiastic than it has everbeen, there are uone who doubt.A Just Judge.At the opening of the MadisonCircuit Court last week Judge Shackelford called the' attention of thegrand jury to the flagrant violationsof the motor vehicle law in the cityof Richmond and Madison county.He said the law strictly forbids adrunken man from operating an automobiler that children under sixteenyears of age were also forbidden" tooperate an automobile, and there arecertain rules regulating the speed ofautomobiles in the city and county.He said drunken men were drivingmachines; children who could notlook over the wheels were drivingthem; that negro delivery boys inthe city were driving them recklessly; that many persons would runat a high speed through the streetswithout lights at night and fail togive warning at crossings and streetcorners. He said he had seen several narrow escapes of people, andthat this reckless driving was a greatmenace to the safety of the people,and especially to aged persons andchildren on their way to and fromschool. He said it would be all righti the fool drivers would kill themselves, but they were liable-to hurtsomebody else, and he urged the juryto thoroughly 'investigate-these violations of the motor law.aSHE CHOOSES A MAXWELL.Possessed of a regular fleet of highpowered motor, cars, Miss CharlotteWalker, a society belle of San Francisco, whose fame as a motoring tourist extends to all pafts of the. UnitedStates, chooses a Maxwell touringcar for mountain work in preferenceto the much higher priced motors."The ease of control and sturdypower of the Maxwell are ideal forthe different trials in the Hills," MissWalker says.She asserts the Maxwell takes thesteep inclines much better than anyof her other possessions. She hastoured over the Rockies, the Selkirks,Grand Canyon, White Mountainsand visited nearly all 'the beautyspots in the Uinted States and Canada. Motoring to inaccessible placesis a much stronger hobby with MissWalker than the usual society diversions to most young women.She is now 'planning several verydifficult trips for the early fall season. (ady)te na mROADS CONTINUE POLICY OP COMMANDEERING COAL.' In view of a threatened shortage ofcoal, the ljuisville & Nashville railroad and other roads are continuingtheir policy of commandeering coalwherever they can get it.W. L. Mapother, vice president ofthe L. &N., said almost every road inthe country had been compelled to dothis because the Government expected that the trains be kept running.His road is paying for the coal atprices fixed by. the Government, except in cases where .contracts existbetween the road and the mine operators. Instead of having a large supply on hand, as railroads generallydo, they have been facing a shortagefor several months. It is assertedthat this commandeering is not inviolation of the law.POSTMASTERS RECEIVE INSTRUCTIONS REGARDINGNEW RATES.Detailed instructions to postmasters on increased letter mail rates,which becomes effective Nov. 2, underthe terms of the war tax. bill, havebeen issued by Postmaster GeneralBurleson.The new order for increased past--agerates do not apply to mail tomost of the foreign countries, but doapply to all domestice mail, includingCanada, Mexico, Cuba, Panama andall nerson&in the military service oflhe ted States in Europe.

Some of our merchants are doing all they can to liveup to their agreement, while othersfind all kind of excuses to extend thetime of closing. One of their mainexcuses has been that customers willdelay their purchases to" the lastminute, and by entering stores at theclosing hour make it difficult formerchants to close their stores as'agreed upon.The Merchants Protective Association of Bourbon County at its lastmeeting directed by an unanimousvote that the undersigned make anurgent appeal to the public to kindlyassist the merchants by making alltheir purchases so as not to conflictwith this closing arrangement.There must be- reason in allthings. A business or householdconducted without order and systemcannot bring complete success. Remember success does not mean moneyalone but also means "Happiness,Harmony and Good Health."The mechanic and ordinary daylaborer will not 'work over 10 or 8hours per day. This you will agreeis exactly right. But why thenshould -we expect a merchant towork -from 6 a. m. to 10 or even 12p. m., or from 12 to 18 hours perday? vThe merchant desires good healthand wants to live as long as others.He wants to enjoy the company ofhis wife and. children, at eveningduring the week as well as only onSundays. Two hours extra rest eachday means all this for him and betterservice for you on the next day Nodoubt you believe this is right andare willing to grant him and hisclerks and porters this necessaryrest Then why not help him to liveup to his pledge and make your purchases accordingly?To those merchants who have sofar failed to close their stores aspromptly as they agreed, we appealagain, "For the good of all, as wellas your own welfare, let us stand together and work like one man."- To those merchants who so farhave failed to fall in line on theclosing agreement, we extend anearnest appeal to "Come and work together with us for a common cause,"andto the public we appeal for theirencouragement and co-operation inthis movement, because we believe itright.SignedFRBD WBCKESSER, Chairman.;WM.

'' . v" S"7?Z -aB ; B &POINTS ABOUT SKIRTS THEVOGUE OF TUCKS.NEW YORK, Oct. 5, 1917.This is the harvest season; thewatchful waiting and the hard laborof the summer months are being rewarded. Despite fee predictions ofthe pessimists, the uriusual conditionof the weather, and the shortage oflabor, there has never been so wonderful a crop of wneat, of corn, orof fashions. The matter has been socarefully systematized, that the gradeof efficiency reached in these patrioticendeavors is almost unbelievable.Speaking from the fashion standpoint, one can safely say that therenever has been a time when the stylesfitMXi!-- ! --2&A3 J iJ&-TJinnIc Cali,A Warm Coat For Cool Dayswere so universally becoming andsatisfactory. The "Paris openingshave brought out charming things.One hears of the marvelous materialsand one sees the models brought overby the intrepid buyers, and they areso interesting and wonderful thatthey seem too good to be true almost! The Narrow Way of the Skirt- Yes, indeed, skirts are narrow,and there is a very good reason fortheir being so. The Government hasasked that wool be conserved, andthe patriotic designer and the fashionable women alike cry, "Well, wecan help by wearing skirts that arenot too-wide; let them be narrow."And narrow they are, too, and short, ithough, perhaps not quite so shortas last year. It is not comfortable towalk in a tight skirt that is long,and so once (more we find commonsense aiding fashions. One must,however, not go to the other extremeand have Jthe skirt too narrow forbeauty.The Fall CoatOne of the big Paris houses hasdecided that the fall would not befall without the coat suit, and sothey are declaring with all theirmight and main that the smart thingis the suit, wrist-length coat, andshort tight skirts Another equallyfamous house forswears .11 allegianceto this old standby, and designs nothing but coats and dresses for streetwear. So, there in a nutshell youhave it, and the advantage is withyou, for you are American and candecide for yourself this all-importantquestion. There can be no doubt thatthe top coat has a place of its ownin the wardrobe of the smart woman.If the coat be stylish and becomingof line and color, the dress of lastyear can be worn with perfect confidence. (That is, if you don't takeoff your coat! )A splendid example of an all-embracing,all-covering coat is illustrated here. It is made of fur cloth,with the square collar that is -consideredso unusually smart. Thepocket sections, which give the widehip effect, can be omitted, thus giving a coat built on straighter lines.As you see, it is full" length, and iscomfortable in every respect. Thelarge buttons and the contrasting furcloth for the collar and cuffs are theonly trimming necessary.The Coming-Out of TucksThere is nothing more attractivethan the tiny tucks you find on everything. They are taking the place toa great extent of the hemstitching somuch used for the past three or fourseasons.

Butsome war customs are being practiced, and while there is no shortage ofmen, it is the interesting fact that women are working themselves intomany branches of employment hitherto followed only by men. Here isa woman conductor in Valparaiso, one of the great Pacific ports of busyChili, leaving her car after a trip. There is no explanation why the menhave given up railroadin' or why the women have, taken it up, but, nodoubt, the men have been able to find more lucrative employment in otherlines of endeavor.

Blackis preferred, or the color of the suit.One does not often see braid of acontrasting shade on the really distinctive costume. You see, everything is so simple this year, and allmore attractive on account of thissimplicity.Dated Autumn, 1917.News from the suit front declaresthat coats vary inlength from thevery short Eton jacket to the longthree-quarter length coat.
