THE CHAUTAUQUA.
K Although it will be several weeks
yet before the big Chautauqua tent
will be erected in this city, interest
is already being manifested in the
approaching event, which gives prom
ise of being fully equal to its prede
cessors in every respect. The pro
gram which will be presented this
year is one of the best' the White
Meyers System has yet put on the
road, according to the verdict ren
dered by the cities where it has al
ready been presented.
The Chautauqua means much to
this community. Presented this year
for the benefit of the Red Cross, the
cause should appeal to the people.
The strength and quality of the pro
grams are an uplift. They will afford
opportunity for cultured entertain
ments that is not the usual privilege
of small cities. They give a chance
o breathe a different atmosphere.
They give a new view of life. They
are-all to the good. There is no
question about the immense benefit
of the Chautauqua and it should be
liberally patronized by our people.
Display advertisements that have
been printed in THE NEWS have
told in an alluring way of the attrac
tions that will be presented at this
season's Chautauqua. Others will
follow , from time to time. Season
tickets will soon be 'on sale at places
that will be designated later on, at
$2.00 for the twelve sessions, or $1.00
for those under twelve years of age.

FOOD ADMINISTRATOR REGU
LATES SELLING OP SUGAR.
Fred M. Sackett, Federal Food

to all persons selling sugar in the

ing regulations become effective at
once.
1 Retail sales of sugar for house
hold purposes must be limited to two
(2) pounds to city and town resi
dents, and five (5) pounds to rural
and city residents.
2 Retail sales of sugar for- can
ning and preserving must be limited
to twenty-five (25) pounds at one
time, and then only when accompa
nied by a signed certificate on the
Government form pledging the custo
mer to use that particular sugar for
the particular purpose of canning
and preserving food.
3 Customers are expected to limit
the use of sugar for household pur
poses to three (3) pounds per month
per person.
4 Manufacturers using sugar can
only buy sugar through the Sugar Di
vision ..of the Food Administration,
701 Inter-Southern Building, Louis
ville, Kentucky, from which Depart
ment they must secure sugar certi
ficates. This applies to operators of
soda fountains, candy, syrup, soft

5 In hotels, resaurants and all

served to each person for a pot or cup
of coffee or tea. Granulated or
powdered sugar to be served by coun
ter man or waiter for berries, cereals
and fruits.
The above regulations, some of
which have been in force for several
weeks were made public and for
warded to all parts of the State upon
receipt of urgent telegrams from Mr.
Hoover at Washington, who" wired
that developments in the sugar situ
ation in the last few days made in
creased conservation in sugar imper
atively necessary.

CAN IT BE POSSIBLE?
Some time ago uncertainty as to
the quality of water furnished pat
rons of the Paris Water Company
furnished the topic of conversation
or argument pro and con in many
places in Paris. The discussion waxed
warm and adherents of both sides
grew warmer.
The agitation finally led to at
temps to have the water scientifically
analysed. Three samples of the wa
ter taken from hydrants in different
localities were secured and sent by
Mayor E. B. January to the State
Board of Health at Bowling Green,
with a request that a thorough,
comprehensive and accurate chemical
anaylsis be made and a report sub
mitted. Wednesday the following re
ply was received by Mayor January
from Dr. Jas. M. McCormick, State
Sanitary Inspector for the State
Board of Health:
"Bowling Green, Ky.
"June 18, 1918.
"Mayor E. B. January, Paris, Ky.
"Dear Sir We regret to inform
you that all three samples of water
submitted by you still show some evi
dence of pollution with colon bac
illus or sewage bacteria from intes
tinal discharges.
' "If we can be of further service to
you, please call upon us.
"Yours Truly,
"J. M. McCORMICK,
"State Sanitary Inspector."
THE NEWS submits to the people
of Paris that, though, the above re
port does not nesessarily imply a
scare, they should boil all water used
for drinking purposes, as a measure
of precaution. Notice to that effect
was published some weeks ago by
order of the City Board of Health.
