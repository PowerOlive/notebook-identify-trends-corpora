The money I received exceeded considerably what I paid in, to say nothing of my peace of mind thatI was fully protected in case of a storm. I have always advocated carrying hail, insurance on tobacco witKbut which everygrower takes a chance to lose all. With it he can, in safety, gointo the business of producing a crop which requires, as doestobacco, so much labor, time and money. ""Now that the Burley Growers have gone into an organizationto handle their business in a modern economic business-likeway, I see no reason why all growers can not take out insuranceon the reduced ratethe companies'are now quoting."Look up the insurance agent' in your section now, and let himprotect you against the loss of your tobacco.
