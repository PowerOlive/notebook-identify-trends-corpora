relationsthat would be affected by the enactment of the Dingley tariff act directing them to communicate to the foreignoffices in their respective posts the textof the act and to call attention tothe sections of the new tariff which provide for retaliationreciprocity and similar arrangementsThis is done in order that there may bea proper basis for the institution ofnegotiations looking to the consummation of some of the reciprocal agreements contemplated in the Dingley actThe groundto be covered by the statedepartment in these negotiationswill be difficult to traverse owing to the complexity ofthe subjects to be treated ofand the dissimilar conditionsexisting in various countries withwhich we must have to do yet therecan not be any delay in undertakingthe task inasmuch as congress has interms enjoined the beginning of thenegotiations as soon as may be afterthe passage of this act So far it issaid no formal responses to our advances have been made but from certain news items that come from Europeit is perceived that such overtures maybe expected at any momentWashington Aug 7 RepresentativeJ Hamilton Lewis of the state ofWashington Friday had a conferencewith the

information this duty -was 15 cents apound on goods of every characterThe treasury officials are inclined todoubt the accuracy of this report buthave taken means to ascertain thefacts If however it

The navy department Friday directed the preliminary acceptance of the gunboats Marietta and Wheeling built by the Unioniron works at San Francisco Therehad been some question as to the acceptance of these boats owing to thefact that the machinery was overweight in -which case the contract provided for deductions from the price tobe paid It was shown however byan engineer examination that the additional weight was attributable tochanges in plans that benefitted themachinery and added to the speed ofthe boats so no deductions were madeWOMANS FISTFells a Man at East Liverpool Doctor

Judge JohnrJayJacksons blanket injunction againstthe agitators which will remain in forceuntil September 20 when argumentswill be hadby both sides It is thoughtthe strike will be over by that timeBy the injunction Debs and his associates are enjoined from speaking onthe subject of strikes in and about theMonongah mines They are not permitted to intercept miners on theirway to and from work they can notspeak on any of the public highwaysleading to the mines of the petitionerslastly they are ordered to hold nopublic or private meetings whatsoeverin the neighborhood of the mines inquestionThree injunctions almost as sweeping have been granted in the Pittsburgh disti ict but it is said here thatthey are not being enforcedThe Evening Post the leading financial and corporation organ of NewYork and usually the last to givestrikers any sort of encouragementsaysIf the press report of the nature ofthe injunction granted by Judge Jackson is correct the striking miners arehardly getting fair treatment As Debssays he has been enjoined off the faceof the earthA man may be an extremely foolishor mischievous agitator but so long ashe refrains from violence and from inciting others to violence it has notbeen the policy of the common law tointerfere with himThe Tribune Saturday morning alsocondemns the Jackson injunction saying it is calculated to make all lawhatefulCOL AGUIRAThinks the Assassination of Canovas WillResult in the Estabishment of the Republic of SpainWashington Aug 9 Col A AAguira who is stopping in Washington said Sunday nightThe assassination of Canovasin the dethronement of the Spanish monarchy and the freedom of CubaThe people of Spain are ripe for a revolution being discontented over thehigh taxation which grinds them downto povertj and in some cases to starvation This is the beginning of the revolutionary movement and is connectedwith the recent attempt on the life ofthe queenThere is great dissatisfaction overthe result of the war in Cuba and toremoce Canovas was the object of welllaid plans lie was the supporter ofWeyler who was sent to Cuba by himand kept there by him The twodivided the spoils of Cuba and ofSpain I am certain that Canovas willbe succeeded by Sagasta his politicalrival and leader of the liberal partySagasta will undoubtedly take immediate steps to conciliate the Cubans bygranting them reforms but it will betoo late I expect to see Cuba freewithin 10 days and the republic ofSpain established soon afterwardsBIRMINGHAM ALACxpects to Bid for the Location Thereof theProjected Government Armor Plate

thought to be buried in theruins of the elevator and one manwas blown into the Chicago riverFrom the force with which the explosion swept the spot on wich hewas standing it is certain he must havebeen instantly killed Either thebursting of a boiler or the explosion ofmill dust caused the awful havocThe origin of the blaze is believed tohave been in the vicinity of the boilerhouse Accumulated dust as dry andinflammable as gunpowder that hadbeen piling up for years formed aready means for the fire It spreadwith great rapidity and then came aterrific explosion completing the workof scattering the

wife who waswith him lingering in agony for twohours and then passing away with thecry of Long live Spain which werethe last words upon his lipsSanta Agueda is noted for its bathsThe place is between San Sebastianthe summer residence of the Spanishcourt and VittOria the capital of theprovince of Alava about thirty milessouth of Bilbao The premier wentthere last Thursday to take a threeweeks course

meeting of the cabinetSunday under the presidency of SenorCos Gayon minister of the interior thelatter announced that he had been intrusted hy the queen regent with thepremiership ad interimThe murderer declares that he killedSenor Canovas in accomplishment ofa just vengeance and that the deed isthe outcome of a vast anarchist conspiracy He is believed to have arrivedat Santa Agueda the same day as thepremier and he was frequently seenlurking in the passages of the bathingestablishment in a suspicious mannerThe remains of Senor Canavos willbe brought here Monday MarshalMartinez Campos has gone to San Sebastian to attend the queen regentWashington Aug 9 Thisment probably has already received theformal notification of Premier Canovas assassination but if so it is lockedup with other dispatches in the statedepartment and will not be known untilSecretary Sherman reaches the department Monday morning Immediatelythe state department according toits usual custom will announce theevent to the president ami the latterwill in some way make formal andpublic expression regarding the governments deep regret lust in whatform this expression will be coached isnot known for precedents differ but itdoubtless will be a dispatch to theSpanish government simple and sympathetic in its termsSecretaiy of State Sherman receivedthe first news of the affair through abulletin He expressed deep interestin the details He saidThis deplorable event will havesome effect of course on the politicalaffairs of Spain but to what extent Ican not say The death of one man isnot necessarily going to change thesentiment of the whole countrySpain Is a very tenacious country Her money is gone Herresources have been exhausted Butshe means evidently to hold CubaJust how she can do it under these circumstances I can not see Yet she isopposed to yielding a point PremierCanovas was a strong partisan Hewas the chief exponent of the elementwhich was determined to keep theisland at all hazards Seemingly Spainis almost a unit on this Canovas was astrong factor in the government ofSpain but it is not impossible that another will be found to replace in thatimportant office having similar viewsand the same pronounced ideas Howit may be in this case I am not able tosay but the effects politically of suchan event are not essentially far-reachingand have not always produced radical development As to the consequences of the conflict in Cuba I donot care to talk I have no official information of the assassination andmust refrain from venturing guessesas to what it may effect in the futureAsked as to how long he now thoughtthe Cuban insurrection might last hereplied that that was problematical andhe did not care to discuss it He addedthat he had heard vai ious names ofprominent leaders in Spain mentionedbut he was not well informed as tothem and there was nothing on whichhe could base a prediction as to Canovas probable successorIllinois Miners Fass

once moreestablished at the Hotel Johannisbergwith the bustle and stress of the newcUy already beginning to efface thememory of the quiet dajs spent at thePuncan farm The changes wrought inthe few weeks were almost incredsbleThe encroaching- flood of buildings hadspread out over the vacant spaces newstructures of preposterous height andbulk reared themselves in localitieswhere Philip remembered seeing thesreen grass of the meadow or the stubtye of last years cornfield The streetswere in the chaotic condition whichprecedes the laying of pavements thegas and water companies rivaling eachother inmakingtheroadwajimpassabloduring the hurried trenching for pipesand conduits The daily auction salesof real estate continued but they hadbeen driven from the busy businesscenter and Mr Fenchs rostrum appeared only in the suburbs of Cheltenham Heights Arlington Terrace orNotwithstanding the pressure of aspeculative atmosphere which mightwell have turned a more steadfast manaside Philip held steadily to the purpose which had taken him back totown He examined the records in theold courthouse and found that a deedin lvilgrows name had been duly entered with that drawn b3 Cates and theenly suspicious circumstance was uXboth documents had been recorded onthe same day In the light of Kilgro -vsdenial the appearance on the record ofthe older deed established the fact oforgery on the part of some one andwhile the presumption of guilt pointedtoward Cates the anonymous letter toDuncan fortunately saved Philip frombeing led astray at the outsetAssuming that the deeds themselveswere in thehands of themanagerPhilipcalled upon Tench in the character of apossible purchaser of real estateYes yes I remember you came upon the train with you Thought youdcome around after youd seen whatwere doing Mr Fench was amiablyvoluble and it was some time beforePhilip could find space to drive in thewedge of rejoinder Of course glad1c show yon anything weve got Insideor outside property Mr ThorndykeInside I think Philip replied examining the map spread out on Fenchsresk about there I should sayplacing his finger on two vacant lotswell within the limits of the Cates tractHa best location in the city absolutely gilt edge I guess you know aI shall want alittle time for examinationthe titleofgood thing when you see it eh MrThorndykePhilip bowed his acknowledgmentsand asked the priceSixteen thousand apiece and thatscheap tA month ago I should have laughedat youMr Fench now I shall only saythat I think youre a little ahead of themarketWhereupon the manager leaned backthrew one leg over the arm of his chairand proceeded to demonstrate by anargument in which volubility outranitself that the price asked was conserative rather than speculative thatMessrs This and That of Cincinnatiand Senator The Other of Michiganowners of the property on either side ofthe lots in question had refused fabulous offers for their holdings andmuch more to the same effectpunctuated and emphasized by MrFenchs right forefinger laid impressively in the palm of his left handThe visitor listened patiently and foronce in his life having a definite objectin view forgot to be bored When themanager ran out of breath Philip saidI still think your figure is too highbut we can talk of that later I shallwant a little time for investigation andfor an examination of the titleHe was watching his antagonist tomark the first sign of discomposure Itcame at the word title Fench suddenlyfost interest and the self assertive legslid limply down from the arm of theeh airhold the bargain for you but I cantOur people wont let me block themarket not even when its to their interest to do ItPhilip saw his advantage and pushedit I can see the justice of such a ruleand Ill not ask you to make an exception in my case I jiresume you cansatisfy me as to the soundness of thetitle of course yxm have an abstractFench bounded from his chair withsomething that sounded very lflce anoath Excuse me Mr Thorndyke Ivegot an engagement at the bank andIll have to turn you over to Mr Sharpless our attorney Hell give you ail thepoints on the the title and so forthJust come with me and Ill introduceyouOne moment interposed Philip Ifwere to do business together its onlyfair that you should know somethingabout me If youll write or telegraphto ColvA M Van Cott Temple CourtNew York he will have my

had plum forgotmy appointment as our Alabamafriends would saj Mr Sharpless makeyou acquainted with Mr ThorndykeHe wants to talk title with you on lots13 and 14 block ISFor once in a way Philip regrettedthat he could not observe two men atthe same instant He was sure that themanager would try to put the lawyeron his guard but Sharpless impassiveface was blandly inscrutable as he roseand held out his hand From the factthat he was immediate given a highbacked chair facing the light of thewindow which made an expressionlesssilhouette of the lawyer Philip arguedthat the sign had been passed and understood and the suspicion was confirmed by the first question he wascalled upon to answerWhat makes you think that our titleisnt perfect Mr ThornctykeI beg your pardon I had raised nosuch question It is merely a matter ofprudence in a transaction involving somuch money that one should be wellassured of his titleThat is very true The lots youpicked out are in a tract formerlyknown as the Cates farm you can readthe whole history of the tract in therecords at the courthouseQuite possibly but one may iiaveneither the time nor the inclinationA glance at your abstract would bequite sufficient for my purposeSharpless swung back in his chairand slipped his hands into his pocketsI wish I could oblige you he saidbut I infer youve had little to do withproperty in Alabama Such a thing asan abstract of title is almost uxnownamong people who can neither -writetheir deeds nor read them after they arowritten I began just as you have andwas glad enough in the end to fallback on the recordsThorndyke knew this was an answerthat Sharpless would never have madeto another lawyer si nee analisfxacVisnothing more than a circumstantial history of any given piece of propertycompiled from the records but he watoo shrewd to betray his professionand he made no commentI suppose you were able to satisfyyourself that your titles were allrightAbsolutely we guarantee to defend our purchasersWill you allow me to look at yourdeeds for the tract in questionI should be glad to but I cant dothat either All the original documents are on file in the companys officein New YorkPhilip was beaten for a moment buthe rallied immediately Will youauthorize my solicitor to examinethemSharpless lost his head at that andThorndyke gained his point Certainly not such a proceeding would beunheard of Our secretary vouldpromptly refer the gentleman to mePhilip rose and bowed courteouslyIm sorry we cant arrive at an understanding I should like to have thoselotsBut my dear sir Sharpless hadquite recovered his elf control andwas industriously cursing himself forhaving made the slip cant you seehow unreasonable you are Dont yousuppose that among our hundreds olcustomers there are men who are quiteJ as careful of their rights as you can beof yoursAnd none of them have seen thesedeedsXot a man of them I assure youGo to any of them and youll find thattheyve taken our guarantee in perfectgood faithTo whom would you refer meTo anyone to the president of theChiwassee national bank if youpleaseVery well Ill think the matterover and see you again Good morningWhemThorndyke left the office he began to fear that theearlierdeeduponthediscovery of which the very life of hiscase would depend had been destroyedand there was small comfort in the reflection that there was no apparentreason for the disappearance of both ofI them That from Cates to the towncompany was undoubtedly genuineand he could not understand why iv1 00 should be missing He felt keenlythe need of an adviser but in a citywhere the interests of every other responsible person might be against lfimhe was afraid to trust anyone To besure there were Protheroe and Duncan but the first was in the service ofth town company and the Scotchmanhad already emptied himself of whatever suggestive material there was inhim Philip expected nothing furtherin the way of information from Fenchor Sharpless but none the less he senta message to Col Van Cott asking himto give prompt attention to any inquiryYes yes of course youll want to from Allacoochee suppressing onlyknow about these tilings and Id like to the fact of the senders professionTHE BOURBON NEWbTUJBAY AUGUST 10 1887When that was done Philip foundhimself once more among the uncertainties but he made another journey10 tlie courthouse for the purpose ofcopyingthethe missing documents fromrecords For two dajrs he tjordover these copies in his room at the hotel searching with infinite patience forsome clew that would point the wayout of the tangle A copy of a copyproved to be barren of suggestion buthe made a memorandum of the attesting notarys name and on the third dayhe paid a visit to Squire PragmoreNothing enme of it however Thenotarys rerjlies grew more indefiniteas the inquiry progressed His memorywas at fault he had acknowledged somany papers for the town companythat he could not be expected to recollect the details of any one transactionThorndyke called attention to the factthat the older deed antedated by several years the beginning of the rush ofbusiness brought- by the transfers ofthe town company whereupon Pragmore took another tack It was toolong agoedgedHe had doubtlessICilgrows signature but hecould remember none of the circumstancesThorndyke was baffled again but another clew came to the surface when heSi fkThe note and letter were both written on thesame machinereached the hotel and found a notefrom Sharpless asking him to call atthe companys oilice He went was received with a cordiality born of the favorable answer to the telegram sent byFench to Col Van Cott and was shownthe missing deeds with an air of reproachful frankness that almost disarmed himSince you made a point of it I wiredour secretary to send them downSharpless explained and as Philip readthem he thought he could never be sufficiently grateful for the impulse thathad led him to make the copies from therecords In poring over them he hadwell nigh committed them to memoryand a single reading of the pretendedoriginals convinced him that thesewere recent forgeries The notarys attestation was genuine a fact that atonce implicated Pragmore and if anyfurther damnatory iroof na3 beenneeded it was supplied by a single circumstance in the acknowledgmentPragmore had used a rubber stamp withiauottea line lor nisrsignatureancibtnewords notary public beneath if amithe gummy ink of the stamp was stillfresh enough to be blurred by thethumb of the readerPhilip read the papers leisurely asecond time and handed them back tothe attorneyIm sorry you ent to so muchtrouble he said I have given up thidea of buying inside and have beenthinking more particularly of tryingsomething in the resident districtSharpless met him half way andPhilip thought he surprised a fleetingexpression of relief on the shrewd faceof the lawyer Thats a sensible changeBetween us and leaving Mr Fench outof the question I believe theres moremoney to be made in CheltenhamHeights than on Broadway Ive scattered 1113 own little bit of cajjitalarouud on the edgesPhilip got away as soon as he coulddecently and went back to his room topiece together the deductions hichmight fairly be drawn from the inter-iew The first point made clear wasthe undoubted guilt of the conspirators if they had committed forgery forthe purpose of imposing on a singlej ustomer it was reasonable to concludethat they had not hesitated when thenecessity was far more urgent Another deduction was of even greater importance Fench and Sharpless hadh confederate in Pragmore and herevas a vulnerable point If the notaryset a price upon his silence he mightalso be induced to speak if it weremade sufficiently profitable for him todo so A third inference was that theoriginal forgery and the deed fromCates had disappeared otherwise theconspirators would not have been atthe trouble of fabricating new onesPhilip sat up late that night studying the problem and trying to determine what he should do next but hisperseverance was rewarded only by theturning of one more conjecture into acertainty The note which had calledi An to the attorne3s office was intypewriting and a comparison of itsmechanical inaccuracies with those inthe anonymous letter to Duncan provedthat both were written on the same ma-I chiuneXIIILOSS AND GAINIt was early in

wrestled with the difficulties of the legal problem the fireburned within him consuming somerubbish and shedding new light intothe dusky corners of the soul chamberhitherto obscured by the shadows of illhealth and morbidness The light wasnot altogether welcome though it materially lessened the distance betweenthe ostensible Philip and Philip thereal For one thing it belittled the motive which was

the new ideal and his sanerthought told him that it was wretchedly inadequate that it sprang from Impulse and was degraded in the hourof its birth by unfaith Unworthy asit was it was still an ideal

lives of any of the patients so it wasMrs Hathaways proud boast that asfar as she had heard tell she was theonly person who had ever been curedby elocutionBut the enjoyment and delight thosepoor

leaves At first the idlerwas puzzled to know how it managedto stand in the air in such a mannerbut soon he saw that it was held in thejaws of a snake The snae was lessthan two feet long and was what wasknown locally as a water moccasinllis head was about half an inch broadand his neck smaller in size than anordinary lead pencil The frog in thethickest part was about two inchesacross The snakes jaws were closedjust over the end of one of the frogshind legs and even that was such amouthful that Yc seemed as if the jawswere stretched to their utmostIn and out among the leaves thesnake slowly

an irritant nature though a fewnarcotic principles are to be foundThe virulence of the poisonous variesvery much but there are very few individuals of this order which are inertThe various species of buttercups haveall irritant properties and in the absence of better drugs they have occasionally been used as vesicatories Cowsavoid buttercups but hogs and someother animals can eat them with

start the youngsters inthe way to be profitable feed consumers So long as these favorable conditions exist in the pasture lot there isno advantage in making changes butwhen the time comes that a cool darkstable and mown clover or oats andtares would give the calves greatercomfort jxist at that time should suchconditions be administered This ismore particularly applicable to calvesthat are to become beefers because wewant to sell for money some time inthe future every pound of gain ourfeed has made and not allow any of itto be lost after being once beneath theskin With dairy calves rapid development when of a muscular characteris very important A stunted animalis always much less profitable than itwould have been had its growth beencontinuous because its digestion willbe stronger and

Iiive 1hSuburban DistrictsThere are some people who imaginethat residents in the country are ignorant of and indifferent to all mattersconnected with etiquette that they donot trouble either to know or to do thecorrect thing that they throw all ceremony to the winds and follow the dictates of their own sweet will in all social matters This is of course an extreme view but it is one that is to a certain extent held by some folks thoughit is all entirely erroneous for countryfolk are not only just as but even moreparticular about these matters thanare the dwellers in town for new ideasand new ways both of manner andspeech are not so easily accepted oradopted by the former as by the latterThere is no doubt less stiffness andmore sociability in the country for people are thrown more together and aremore dependent upon one another forcompanionship for kindness and attention It makes little or no differencewho is ones neighbor in town but inthe country it is a most important matter Although the rules of etiquette that govern society arethe same in the country as inthe town there are one or two littlecustoms that are dissimilar as for instance the matter of first visits Thenewcomer can neither call nor leavecards first It is the residents whotake the initiative in the matter andthis whether they have a previous acquaintance with the newcomer or not1ATEE BOURBON NEWS TUESDAY AUGUST 10 1897and the same rule regarding first visits holds good also in country townsand old cathedral citiesIn the country when visitors callearly in the afternoon which is oftenthe case when people live at some distance from one another and have a longdrive tea should be ordered for themby the hostess even if it should be earlier than the usual hour for it andthough wine is never offered to afternoon callers in towns it is quite correct to offer the gentlemen visitors inthe country When a lady drives herself and has no groom in attendancefor though ladies do not drive themselves in the town without being attended by the groom they often doso in the country the servant wrhoopens the door for them sends for someone to hold the horse or pony Whenthis is done the lady at the conclusion of her visit should give the manor boy who does this for her somelittle gratuity in return for his services This is always expected of herand should not be forgotten The sumgiven should not be a large one a sispence or a shilling will be quite sufficient for the purpose Of course whena groom is in attendance this is not necessary Sometimes when visitors havdriven long distances which is oftenthe case in the countrj the carriageinstead of remaining at the door asin town is sent round to the stablesand the horses taken out When thishas been done the visitor before risingto take leave of her hostess should askif she might ring and order her carriage and the hostess unless a gentleman is present to do so for her ringsthe bell and when the servant entersthe visitor should ask for her carriageWhen if comes around the servantreturns and announces that it is readyand the visitor then rises and takes leaveof the hostess She does not go out andwait in the hall until the carriagecomes around but remains in the drawing-roomwith her hostess until its arrival is announced London LadyCUSHIONS IN HIGH FAVORAmericans Developing the Iaxurions Taste of the OrientalsFashion has insisted and
