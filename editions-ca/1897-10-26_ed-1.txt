PhiliD Hitchborn Qhwf- ator or tne navy xucWork on New Vessels Stopped o JLofonntof Iiack of Funds Urgent Need igrfflmprovements in Navy PlantsBetterDocks Are Needed Badly rSLWashington Oct 25 In his -annualreport to the secretary of theiinavyPhilip Hichborn chief constructor ofthe navy says that the strengthof thenavy on October 1 was 141 vessels alltold including the ships of both oldand new navies It is stated that during the last few months of the last fiscal year a considerable amount ofrfworkupon vessels that had been authorizedby congress had to be suspended owingto lack of funds This caused a heavydrain upon the new appropriationsat the beginning of the presentfiscal year and makes the exhaustionof those appropriations before thefirstof next July almost an assured VfactChief Hichborn says this is a discouraging state of affairs as exhaustionmeans a wholesale reduction of navyyard forces and the discharge of competent and trained men He points tothe advantage and economy of havingat least one vessel building at each important navy yardProbably the most desirable type ofvessel for the purpose intended particularly in view of the present state ofthe armor question would be that of asheathed cruiser of comparatively lightdraft and great endurance with quarters for flag officersAttention is called to the urgentneed of improving the navy yardplants in the interest of the economicalexecution of work and estimates aresubmitted for each yard The plantsat New York Norfolk and Mare Islandrequire additions alterations and repairs to keep them up to a properstate of efficiency while the yards atBoston Portsmouth and League Islandthough not actively engaged should beput in a condition that would enablethem to work advantageously at shortnotice should occasion require A plantat Puget Sound is also said to be necessaryDuring the last year the governmentaccepted finally four ships the Massachusetts Oregon Ericssen and Brook-lyn while eleven vessels have been accepted preliminarily and subject tofinal test viz Iowa Nashville Wilmington Helena Annapolis Vicksburg Newport Wheeling MariettaPorter and FooteParticular attention is invited to thegood results attending the constructionof the Iowa It is shown that this efficient vessel is able to carry 212 tonsmore than was calculated upon for herdesigned draft The changes in hercase cost only about two per centof the contract price Of jthegunboats the report says that theirfirst cost was remarkably low aggregating about two million dollars forthe nine or not more than the cost ofafirst class armored cruiser The costfof their maintenanceiparticularlywithcopper bottoms and considerable sailpower should be minimumThe chief constructor who is chargedwith the duty of docking ships makesan urgent plea for more and betterdocks stating that the navy has beenat a serious inconvenience during thepast six months for lack of properfacilities for docking battleships Thebureau believes that the necessity for anadditional dock is most urgent at MareIsland and on the Atlantic coast atPortsmouth and Boston while a largerdock at Norfolk and League islandwould be a decided advantage Further consideration is also urged of themerits of Algiers La as a dry docksite and it is urged that all the docksshould be ready in two yearsChief Hichborn under the head ofArmor renews his suggestion that thedepartment should no longer make separate contracts for ships and theirarmor but should permit the Shipbuilder to supply the armorHOTEL FIREThree Persons Burned to Death and Others Injured by Jumping From the

Government PutFilibustering Will ProvnknAn End toa Sharn Tie-joiner From Secretary of State ShermanWashington Oct 23 If as announced in the Madrid dispatches theanswer of Spain to Minister Woodfordscommunication comes in the form of ademand that the United Statesgovernment put an end to filibustering expeditions to Cuba it will provoke a sharprejoinder from Secretary ShermanScarcely a more irritating reply couldbe made by Spain than one whichattempts to put upon the UnitedStates the responsibility for the prolongation of the Cuban struggle Inthe face of a clamorously expressedpublic sentimnc this government hasrefrained from any recognition of oractive sympathy with the Cuban insurgents and the power of the government has been used to prevent filibustering to an extent far bevond whatcongress has regarded as warrantedeven if our sympathies had been withSpainFor Spain to demand still more effective police service of this government and to attempt to fix on theUnited States the responsibility for thestrength and endurance of thflion will be irritating even exasperating to the administration Those whothoroughly understand the presidentsattitude in this matter knowthat he and his secretary ofstate are neither timid nor vascillatingnor are they amiable beyond the demands of propriety If Sagasta shallmake any such demand as the Madriddispatches outline Spanish sensibilities will be shockedin the prompt rejoinder that will be made The suggestion that this government has beeninsincere in its efforts to stop filibustering and that the administration isconniving at violations of neutrality law will be regarded as an insultnot to be passed without notice TheAmerican people have notonly been horrified by the deedsof barbarity on the island ofCuba but have endured the insulting insinuations and hostile demonstrations of the Spanish the imprisonment of American citizens in Cubaand the utter disregard and even malicious injury to American interestswhile American naval vessels and vessels of the revenue marine have atgreat expenditure of money and energy been performing police duty atthe behest of the Spanish minister atWashington This statement of factswill be coupled with a very clear statement that there is an end to AmericantolerationADOLPH LUETGERTMay Be Exhibited in a Dime Museum AfterHis Belease on BailChicago Oct 23 Formal

STiCKNEYCopyright 1896 by J B Llppincott CoCHAPTER XII ContinuedThe doctor had come to WindyGulch renouncing- his profession infavor of mining- ventures which hadresulted disastrously so far but towhich he was sticking- in a forlorn hopeof some day recouping himself for hislosses meanwhile keeinng the wolffrom the door by falling- back upon hislegitimate calling He had nothing- ofworldly advantage to commend himbut he was a g ood fellow and a good-looking-one Any woman mig ht fallin love with such a man and DorotihyMeredith Neil laughed a strangehysterical outburst turning away hishead And I did not even know thatyou knew her he said again Younever spoke of it beforeOh I met her when she was herethe physician nonchalantly explainedbut eying- the sick man with furtiveintentness I did not mention it Isuppose because you naturaUy hatedthe whole outfit so I felt I could choosemore agreeable subjects to talk aboutYes Xhated6thewhole outfit soAnd Neil laughed again that oddluirthless laugh You were so considerateiCBut you are talking too much nowold man the other observed repressirgly Ill be over in the morning andanswer your letters meanwhile youmust not let yourself think about business at all Here comes Mrs Bowento turn your pillows and make you comfortable and you must compose yourself and go to sleep Good nightThere was a low voiced conference mthe hall between nurse and physicianand then Mrs Bowen came to the bedside looking somewhat anxiousAbout them oystere she began thedoctor says -Oh hang the oysters Neil peevishly ejaculated I wish you would godownstairs and get one of the boys tocome up and help me dress Im goingeast in a few days and its timeI wassitting up It is weakening lying hereI never shall get strong if J dont get amove on me Go after Murphy pleasehes the man I wantBut the doctor began Mrs Bown looking frightenedOh I talked it over with the doctor I told Jiim I was going Neillaughed excitedly And I am Nothing on earth shall stop me Will you goafter Murphy now or must I go myselfCHAPTER XHirBut Harvey did not go east as he hadplannedThe very vehemence of his desire toescape an environment he had coine toloathe whipped to a frenzy by the sudden unreasoning jealousy aroused bythe doctors statement that Dorothyhad written to him defeated itself byits own impetuosity Thinking it bestto humor the sick mans whim if onlytc convince him of his weakness MrsBowen had allowed him to be dressedand to sit up for a little while that evening with the result that her argumentcarried beyond her expectations iheover exertion bringing about a relapsewhen as is usual in such cases the conditions were far more grave than in thefirst illnessNow he was delirious babbling of hisworlds fair lady his Dorothy hissweetheart until his voice had grownto be but a husky whisper as he sankdown into the very shadows of deathwhile the doctor listening understoodcomprehending what mischief he hadinadvertently wrought by his half truthabout Dorothys letterIt was an amazing revelation to hima revelation that left him very graveHe had not been a man if he had notperceived that Dorothy Meredith wasa rarely beautiful girl if he had notfelt the winning sweetness of her personality He had enjoyed but a barespeaking acquaintance with her duringmost of her stay at Windy Gulch buthe had fallen into a habit then of watching to see her come and go as he idledaway the hours before his office doorhisthoughtslmgeringaboutrnermorethan he had perhaps quite realized atrthe time and had eagerly seizedupon the oiportunity to be of serviceto her at the time of her fathers deathThey had parted on the footing offriends as a result of the small favorshe hadeein permitted to Tender thenand afterward when of her own sweetwill she wrote to him first a little notoof thanks and later a letter of inquiry in respect to a work of charitywhSch had occurred to her only hecould ever know what vista of hopehad opened before Ms dazzled imagination The doctor was man enough tofeel that she was a woman whom forherself he might love with all his heartwhile he was moreover sufficiently practical not to overlook altogether thewealth which by her f ather s death hadbecome hers a consideration delightfully restful to contemplate after thelong years of struggle against povertyand disappointment which had beenhis And so he had budded his fair aircastle but to see it fall like a house ofcards before the sick mans unconsciousbombs of truth But the doctor was agood fellow and better still a goodfriend and so he only called himself afool for his dreams and thanked heavenhe had excuse to write a certain letterwhich he hoped might bear good fruit fAnd soon after this Harvey beganto dream of seeing Dorothy standingnow and then by his bedside a drearnwhich seemed to fill him with peacemore potent for good than all the doctors medicines the fancy so possessing his imagination that when one dayhe awoke his great hollow eyes eagerly searching the room came back to thedoctors face with a look of helplessdisappointment I thought she washere he whispered weakly I havebeen dreamingOh its all right old fellow hisfriend returned swallowing somethingin his throat as he clasped the poor thinfingers in a tremulous grasp ofulation It was as by a miracle thatpoor Neil had been saved Its allright Go to sleep and dream that sheis coming by and by And faintlysmiling as though he accepted thepromise with the simple credulity ofa child Neil closed his eyes obedientlyand slept againHe did not speak of the fancy whennext he awoke seeming listlessly to accept the conditions as he found themthe trained nurse a deft quiet fellowwho had replaced loquacious MrsBowen the doctor coming and goingthe flowers on the table the recurrent broth and potions But in a fewdaj s the doctor sitting by the bedsidecheerily observed By the way youregetting almost strong enough to beginto think about business a bit arentyou old man The terans of compromise between the mines now you remember that Miss Merediths lawyerwrote you about it Of course youhavent been giving It any thoughtbut erNo I havent been giving it muchthought the invalid returned a shadepassing across his face They mustsee Bartels if there is any hurryiOEm yes5fthe doctor indifferenjlyirejoined But well you remembermy telling you that Miss Meredith hadwritten to ask me about the families ofthe men who were killed in the mineshe wanted to do something for themNeil looked up with a startled expression in his great eyes I did notknow he faltered plucking nervouslyat the bedclothes You said she hadwritten butPossibly it did not occur to me toexplain the doctor nonchalantly rejoined staring hard at something outof the window But she wrote to askabout that just at the time of her lawyers letter suggesting terms of compromise just before you were takendown with this relapse owing to yourconfounded lunacy in rampaging roundwhen you should have been in bed Idropped a line to the attorney tellinghim you were beyond business xrotemand then as I was answering Miss Merediths letter it occurred to me to explain to her as well why her propositionmust be laid on the shelf But herheart seems to have been set on arranging that compromise somehowwhen a woman will she will you knowand so well you recall how Mohammedwent to the mountain under the stressof circumstancesDo you mean oh what do youmean gasped Neil his gaunt featuresstrangely working his eyes hungrilyquestioning- Is she here DorothyYes she is here with her aunt atypical society old maid She willamuse you that aunt So the doctorplacidly went on thinking it wise tosay no more of Dorothy for the moment She is so obviously out of herelement here so uncompromisinglydown on the west and all things western I fancy she leads Miss Dorothyrather a dance with her protests andaristocratic agonies butWhen can I see her demanded thesick man in a tone of breathless pleading Will she see me will shecomeWhy certainly As I said before Irather think she has come on purposeto see you old fellow And if you feelwell enough though I cannot haveyou talking business today but ifyou would like to see her for a momentLike to see her Great heavens doctor dont keep me waiting I havewaited so longAnd a moment later Dorothy wasstanding by the bedside her two handsclasped in his her eyes looking downupon him with such love light in theirsoft depths that it seemed to his dazzled vision as though it could not really be he must still be dreamingIt is you really you he incredulously whispered with trembling touchcaressing the little hands as though hewould assure himself of their realityYou here Why are you here DorothyThe doctor wrote me that you weresick she faltered her fingers tightening about his with a sort oft shudderingtendernesstas at iLremembered terrorAnd you came for that Dorothysweetheart the last time I saw youTHEf BOURBON NEWS TUESUKT OCTOBER 26 1897Vyou told me that yOahated me It was thenot trueI think I think more of you thanI thought I did she murmured bending toward him like a wind blown rosfin the shy confession her eyes downcast her cheeks aflameAh the happy thought God blessj you for it my sweetheart mine Impossible to convey the gladness therapture of that impassioned whisperpunctuated with soft lcisses upon asmall pink palm But he was laughingtoo for gay amusement at her prettyembarrassment in such lightness ofheart as he had thought he could neverknow again and with characteristicimpetuosity he would follow up his triumph with the swift demand merrilymocking her shy hesitancy And dcyou think do you think enough of meto marry me soon darling Ohand now the laughter had left his voicewhile a glint of sudden tears enforcedthe impassioned earnestness of the lowcry I have so hungered so starved foryou DorothyBut though he laid bare his heart inthat brief pleading he was for the moment stunned by the swift granting ofhis prayer I will marry you whenever you like dear she whispered backher e3es alight with a glory of boundless tenderness resolutely bent to meetthe dazed wonder the rapturous questioning of hisIt was his look more than his voicethat presently spoke in his worshipfulMy darling And then he was silentfor awhile covering impulsively withher dear hands his eyes from whichthe glad tears were welling over Ifyou were my wife now he tentativelymuttered after a moment If I couldhave you with me all day long Hebroke off with a little sigh his glanceranging about the small bare bedroom But I could not ask it sweetheart of course I couldnotBut if you do not ask it I dont knowhow I can say yes do it Dorothy murmured drooping toward him in sweetconfusion until it needed but the yielding of an inch to answer the pleadingof his eyes and lay her hot cheeksagainst his in soft caressing4Dorothy It was all he could saybut all his doubt his eager questioninghis tremulous joy found expression inthe one wordYou see and the cirl drew backfrom him a little striving to assume amore matter-of-fact air for the explanation which she could hardly yet putinto coherent phrase auntie I madeher come with me I could not comealone you know and she hates thewest so much it is so hard for her tobecome reconciled to my staying hereso hard for her to uderstand that Imust stay here to be happy Harverhad

it her dutyto say so much went on Dorothy whenshe was sure of his calmer attentionOf course she means it for the bestshe cannot understand but it would beso much better if it were arranged sothat she might go back east and leaveme And then oh dont you seedear and again the blushing facebent to hide itself against his cheek1 want to be with you I mustAnd so there was a quiet little wed-dinggrayin that bare hotel chamber oneNovember morning the roommade bright with a wealth of the fairest flowers that Denver could contribute brighter still in Neils glad eyesfor the bride who came to ius bedsideto be wed the sweet radiance of herhappiness beyond clouding even suchgloom as her relative Miss Van Derlynde wore for the occasionIt was a sore trial for that good ladyThat a niece of hers a Van Derlynde onher mothers side should come to thisrude mining camp to marry this common miner for no explanation couldmake it clear to her that Harvey Neilwas anything else and that she shouldwed in this off hand fashion was ashock to her aristocratic soul fromwhich she felt that she could never quiterecover nad she been fully cognizantof such awful possibilities sure it wasthat she had never been brought toplay the part of a chaperone but nowthat she was here powerless to interfere she submitted herself to the martyrdom of giving away the bride witha feeling as she expressed it afterwards

RoomCanianyone tell me anything of thecity assembly rooms and the assemblyrooms on the Surrey side i e Southwark about the year 1772 The socialside of the city about that time is curiously difficult to get at satisfactorilyFor instance when Catherine Hultonwent to London in 1783 being then 27years of age she went with a certainMr J Woodhouse and his mother Theycalled for her at 730 in the eveningthe gentleman being dressed in a suitof pale blue French silk spotted withpink and green the coat lined withpink silk his hair in a bag a whitefeather in his hat a sword by his sideand his ruffle and frill of fine point laceThis seems very splendid At the assembly the men were chiefly in dresscoats meaning probably of blue orpink silk like that of Mr Woodhousethose who were not wore cloth coatstrimmed with narrow gold lace withwaistcoats of silver tissue and the hairin a queue with curls flying out oneach side of the headThe other ladies were covered withdiamonds The subscription

ground floor and that on acertain night the opening night of theseason of 1772 while the dancingwas at its height some wag threw openthe front door and gave admission to adrove of oxen which began to

affectionately helpingeach other by correcting faults towhich even the best are liafble Familygovernment must of course depend uponthe rule of the father and mother whoin the nature of things are the guidesand helps for their children In eisefecase the superior wisdom of the okkttheads of the family justifies their claimat least while the children axe smallto implicit obedience But there areolder persons in most households whoequally need admonition How shall itbe givenThe self righteous and meddlesomepeople who best like the business of reproving others are always least fittedfor this work The person who feelsmost deeply his own shortcomings andmakes large allowances for others isalways slowest in admonishing forwrongs done by others He does itonly under the admonitions of his ownconscience which tells him that he isreally speaking from the same planewith those he would help There mustbe a common ground on which weshould meet others if we would materially help them The fact that weare all liable to err places the rebukerof sin and the sinner on a commonlevel This in itself places the reproverand him or her who is reproved uponan equality and enables both to profitby the admonition givenIt is enough for scrupulous honestyto come in contact with dishonesty toput it out of countenance The sameis true of selfishness which is the mostprevalent of human sins It is becausethe example of Jesus Christ was of unselfish purity that it was best fittedto arouse the conscience by the exampleof unselfishness and perfect purity suchas the world has never before knownthat it forms a monition of purity andunselfishness such as the world hasnever before known Men harden themselves against the direct admonitionbut the indirect lesson makes its waywithout opposition If we can enlistthe good will and affection of bearersin behalf of divine truth we have wonmore than half the battle It is themost common experience that the hastyceusure of others pruduces no effectbecause it is recognized as being outof place Yet the later censure of thoseslower to speak and1 whoso words arealways thoughtfully considered will beheard with due respect and its admonitions duly heeded

INHABITANTSTwenty Thousand More Native BornWomen Than Men in the StateJersey men and Jersey women dontEmigrate Jersey men and Jersey women dont turn their backs on the farm orthe homestead to found colonies in thesouth or southwest as do the people ofXew York New England and Pennsylvania They are glad to be able to remain in Jersey and under these circumstances it is perhaps just a littlepeculiar that there should be 20000more native born women thtm men inXev JerseyThe male birth rate is higher thanthe female birth rate in New Jerseyas in other states and in most countriesIn the state last year there were born1032 females to each 1000 males but inmost states of the union or at least insettled states of the union this disparity is set off by two causes thehigher male death rate and the loss ofpopulation through emigration Alarger proportion of men thanr womenemigrate and in old established statesespecially in the eastern portion of theeountry and particularly in the NewEngland states Massachusetts RhodeIsland and Connecticut the preponder 1ance of female inhabitants is consider-able Tire average number of births inja year in Kew Jersey exceeds the average number of deaths by 30000 oit10 per cejit but though the numberof births of males is large and hasbeen for many years than the numberof births of females and although thereis practically little emigration fromNew Jersey the factremainsthat thereare 20000 more female than maleiinhabitants in that state native bornThe preponderance of women is notigeneral In Gloucester county for instance which is an South Jersey andtributary to Philadelphia there wereby the last state census GOO more menthan women In Ocean county thehome of fishermen there were by thelast census 9112 male and f679 femaleinhabitants a considerable disparityin favor of the former In Atlanticcounty in Cape -May county in Cumberland county in Salem and in Sussex the male outnumber the female inhabitants On the other hand in theother counties of New Jersey the native-bornfemale inhabitants preponderate The reason is plain New Jersey has enormous manufacturing interests and perhaps the best developedof them is the manufacttire of silk Avery considerable number of those engaged in silk manufacture are womenand girls In Passaic county which includes the city of Paterson there are -1600more native female than male inhabitants In Morris county there are1200 more native female than male inhabitants In Union county which includes the city of Elizabeth there are2200 more native born women than native-bornmen md in Essex countywhich includes the city of Newark withits vast and varied manufactures thereare 7179 more native female thanfive male inhabitants Im addition tothis disparity there

fiveyears Horses and sheep have been forimmediate returns very poor propertyCattle and hogs have at times been valuable but they too often have affordedno encouraging returns The signs ofthe times are changing and there isnow outlook for at least a moderate improvement in all classes of live stockThere is steady improvement in manufacturing business and with the increase in such work there will be igreatly improved demand for goodhorses As the income of salaried people and wage workers is advanced thegrocers and bther retail merchants willbe obliged to have more of the averagesized horses for use on delivery wagonsThis will afford a market to many farmers for their average horses and therewill be a tendency continually amongbreeders with advancing values to produce a better grade of stock for the future As values of all the differentgrades of equine stock improve therewill be a much better feeling amongthe general farmers which will causethem to invest in much needed new implements and machineryIt is usually necessary on the average farm to depend upon such productsas the meats butter eggs wool etcfor the current expenses and living othe family Permanent improvementsmust be made as a rule from the returns of the occasional sale of a teamor a single horseWith the increasing value of all kindsof grain there is every reason to expectan advance in the prices offered for allgrades of live stock There has been agreatly diminished condition of theflocks df the country so that the fleeceswijl not glut the near future The disposition Of so many people to economizein clothing during later jears willnecessarily of course force the massesto buy more freely in the near futureThis urgent demand will advance values -materially With the masse ofworking people employed also therewill be a steady advance in the demandfor meats and the greater variety -ofprovisions When families increasetheir expenditures for the table therewill be a sure and steady call for moradf the farmers productsIt is generally claimed that the supply of hogs throughout the country iless than for some years hitherto Themarkets at the yards indicate an upward tendency so that producers oipork may take oourage to give muchbetter care to the swine than theynveredisposed to do of late because of lovvaluesIt must be remembered that withproving times and values in fheiiproducts the farmers themselves willbe disposed to tise more freely betterfoods for their tables and more of theirbest products generally because -of thefact that an increase in their incomeswill permit more liberal living In toomany cases during panic times somefarmers felt themselves compelled touse for their own provisions largely theproducts which were perishable and tosome i extent unsalable A slight improvement all along the line shouldgive courage for renewed effortEverything produced on the farm hasnow enough worth ti warrant the owners in giving it the best care andand FiresideIT PRESERVERS HIDESAn Importunt

attention when Enos raised the instrumentWe tried of course always to makea route for the show that wouldnt conXflict with anybody else for there wereplenty of towns that wouldnt stand bmVone show at a time Two would losemoney in them however good theymight be But sometimes we ran againstsome stubborn man that wouldnt giveway and then there was nothing to dobut to show and beat him if we couldOnce when we struck a town withanother show we learned somehow thatthey had a great bass horn player intheir band and of course we challengedem for a contest And they took up thechallenge very -promptly There wasntmuch time to prepare for it but webilled the town in an hour and got permission to put up a stand on the publicsquare because it was to be a free exhibition and that attracted attentionThe contest was at noon and ofcourse the two bands played as accompanists of the horn players And thatmade a big band concert and the crowdwas something enormous The termswere that each man was to play onceand then a vote of the people was to betaken The man defeated in that roundhad a right to call for another If theman defeated in the first round won thesecond the man who won the firstround had a right to oall for a thirdround But the winner of two roundsby the vote of the people was to be declared the winner of the contest -Well the men in our show betevery dollar they could rake and scrapeon Enos and some of the more gentlehearted of them thought they werejnstjrobbing the men in the other snow yurold man not only bet all his money uthe bet the idol of his Heart the famousold giraffe of our show against theother shows moth eaten buffalo and hewas so dead sure that he threw in a cinnamon bear to bootOur side had the first inning andour band showed em How to play andthen Enos stood up for his solo Andj how he did make the thunder 1 It wasjoomphah oomphah oomphahl as ithad never been heard before and hefairly carried the people off their feetThen the other band played a tuneand their man got up And theres nouse talking he raised more thunderthan Enos did and set the peopleshoutingThen thevote as hed agreed to do and he wasinterested now as much as anybodyAnd the people voted for the other manas we expected they would But wehadnt any doubt about the final resultfor we thought that Enos would unshackle now and break away and makethe blow of his life And he did Wewho had been hearing him for yearshad never heard him approach what hedid now It was wonderful He set thepeople wild and we thought we hadem sureBut the other mans very first oomphah 1 made us tremble and as he vventon we knew we were lost money giraffe everything Wed never Heardanything like this before It wasnt justsimple peals of thunder it was a thunder factory in full blast and workingwith a double force of men There couldbe only one verdictThat afternoon the whole townwent to the other show and left our bigtent empty The other people cameoverfor the animals theyd won beforeshowtime They wanted to take em overand walk em around in their ring Theold man had em brought out Whenthe giraffe realized what had happenedhe wound his neck around the centerpole and wouldnt budge But the didman finally persuaded him and over hewent to be made a show of in the othercircusEnos Stulkinton never blew a basshorn again Hed had the opportunityof his life had missed it and he hadntthe hearfe After that he always blew abaritoneFor my own part I always thoughtthere was a trick in it Dont you knowthere are things that look fair andsquare on the face of them that you feelcertain all the same are off in someway Well I knew there was somethingwrong about that mans bass hdrh playing and years afterward I heard whatit was He had a bellows attached tothe horn with a hole in the side of thehorn for the nozzle of the bellows andthe bellows inside his clothes out ofsight and a rod running down to atreadle under his foot He reinforcedhis own blowing with blasts from thisbellows and of course the man didntlive that could stand up against himWe told Etios about this 5 But it wastoo hit- Rfrf lostWJiPMThsvyjto play second Tamafc j l5231 Ciluxu-2JwS4jtf 1V4wWlWwmM 181 -fJlWl m JmetfjwCp 5 vimAround
