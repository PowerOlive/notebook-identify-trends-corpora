ISOTHERMS
frrt Vnrt Isothermlc Map Thut
Ave Rarely Learned at School
Here are some definitions of isotherms
appear in American textbooks of
Ettphy
Those lines which are drawn through
glares with an eqnal average of temper
aJbTsre are called isotherms
Iaotherms are lines connecting
rfaoti having the same mean tempera
tore for particular periods as the whole
year the winter or summer
etc
If upon a map all places having
the same mean temperature are con
m hv lines such lines are caUed
feoUtermal lines or simple isotherms
These definitions are part of the
txuiA but not the whole of it It may
not lc a great calamity but the fact is
that most boys and girls leave school
with a misconception as to what an
isotherm is and they rarely find out in
later years
Ihj aU know that two elements
latitude and altitude are the main fac
tors in determining the mean temper
ature of a place that the farther a
place is from the equator and the higher
it strands above sea level the cooler its
climate is But they do not know that
iaotiwa mic maps take into account only
cos t these elements and that is lati
tude They eliminate the influence of
afttade The isotherm passing over the
top etf Pikes peak does not sliow the
mean temperature at the summit of the
moixixtain but what the mean temper
ator would be in that immediate neigh-
jgiliiiill if the land instead of rising
liigh ft ove the sea stood at the level of
Conf y Island
Do you see the reason for this It
may be easily explained Most of the
land loes not rise so high above the sea
that the temperature is greatly affected
hy altitude To the majority of man
kind latitude is a far more important
climatic element than altitude Now
the effects on temperature of both lati
tude and altitude cannot well be shown
at crve man and isothermic maps were
deviled to thow the effects of latitude
and some other element such as posi
tion near the sea or in the far interior
An isothermic line therefore does not
show the actual mean temperature of a
place on it unless that place is at sea
level But it is easy to deduce from the
isotherm the actual mean temperature
of a place if we know its elevation
above the sea How this is done is very
clearly explained by Dr H R Mill
the British geographer as follows
The air grows cooler by 1 degree F
for every 270 feet of elevation above
sea level but isothermic lines show the
eea level temperature In using isother
mic maps vr must therefore remember
that places GuO feet above the sea level
have a temperature 2 degrees lower
than the isotherms indicate places
6000 feet above the sea 22 degrees
lower those 12000 feet above the sea
45 degrees lcvTer and the mountain
elopes 18000 feet above the sea no less
than 66 decrees lower thrn the sea level
temperature shown by the isotherms
This accounts for the fact that none of
the important towns in the temperate
zones is situated more than 2000 feet
above the sea while in the tropics they
are built at as great elevations as 8 000
or 10000 feet
Weather charts are an exception to
this rule They record the actual
thermometrical readings at the points
of observation New York Sun
William Blacks Characters
Sir Wemvss Beid notes that William
Black seldom allowed himself to be
drawn into conversation about his work
One of Reids recollections runs thus
One day in the faroff past I was
walking along the sea front with Black
at Brighton when he said abruptly and
with reference to noihiug that had been
passirg bet ween as We are net all en
gaged in running away with other
mens wives There are some of us who
axe not the victims of mental disease or
moral deformity I do not even know
that anybody of my acquaintance has
committed a murder or a forgery Yet
people are angry with me because I do
not make my characters in my books
odious in this fashion I prefer to write
about sane people and honest people
and I imagine that they are after all
in a majority in the world
Some Went to Glory
I once asked a district nurse says a
writer in The Cornhill Magazine how
the various bick cases had been going on
during my absence from the parish At
once the look which I knew so well
crossed her face but her natural pro
fessional pride strove for the mastery
with the due unctuousness which she
considered necessary for the occasion
At last she evolved the following strange
mixture Middling well sir some of
ems gone straight to glory but I am
glad to say others are nicely on the
anend
Starting Him Right
Ahl sighed the sentimental youth
Would that I might install a senti
ment in your loyal heart
Sir interrupted the practical
maid Id have you understand that
Tny heart is no installment concern

MIGHT HAVE BEEN I MARIES CHOICE
Dolee far niente a sweet doing noth
ing I shall pin that to the catalogue of
memory pictures painted here
She looked up at Dim and laughed She
always laughed Their eyes met then
parted and a vague sense of anticipated
loss came to him with the realization of
her near departure
The mystic beauty of the twinkle hush
ed them into unwonted silence and the
tinkle of the sheep and cow bells rhymed
into reminiscent memories thoughts of
other days when they had watched the
sun fade away in the west The fields
whose greenness was accentuated by lines
of red Virinta soil guarded by deeper
green fir i silhouetted tall and sen
tinellikc it im lar background seemed
to be softly waiting for the coming night
You will forget aU this As for me I
will only be one more in your collection
he smiled evidently a willing victim
Collection of sticks she interrogat
ed laughingly
You are unkind he protested
You think tuen my remembrance of a
very charming winter lik pricked bub
bles will vanish into space
Her face flushed and a shadow deepened
her brown eyes He was looking intently
at a number of holes punched in the sand
with her parasol She caught her breath
as she crushed the laces of her gown
against her side a characteristic gesture
then she went on Weve seen each
other every day if only for a few momei ts
during nearly two months meeting w h
perfect frankness and I thought d
ship If it has all been insincere I s 11
forget Insincere He loaned ne r
saying softly You have made me are
too much but in the north there wi be
other interests in your life crowding me
out until I shall fade into the dim cc rri
I dors of the past
She noted the square strong chin and
mouth and tho li le wrinkles that caught
around the smiling eyes He could thus
lightly toss aside the recollection of drives
of wheeling down shaded country roads
which were he had said like a benedic
tion and the evenings when ho sang with
rii licate insinuation and emphasis about
you dear and love All these
thoughts pricked her mind If she could
only forget him
She rose
lieally you seem most insistent to be
come merely a polka dot in my memory
Dont you think evon then I could al
ways spot you
Her companion groaned
Jest if you must but stay ah stay
fair lady on this perfect day I promise
to do anything say anything if you will
not go
Ycu waxed quite poetical sweetly
There is tho silver moon for the second
verse
Thanks for the suggestion rather
stiffly
Come My hostess will think I am
lost
When a woman will she will
He reluctantly followed They walked
home through the spicy fragrant pines
whose melancholy soughing filled them
both with an undefined sadness
This must be goodby I leave on the
early train tomorrow and never see people
at the station It makes me blue
She stood on the steps with one hand
extended The stars flashed brightly and
the faint moon cast a soft light over her
Looking up at the little rebellious curls
blown about under the wide black hat he
felt an irresistible desire to touch them
but only raised her hand to his lips
Aufwiedersehn You have given me
many happy days and I shall always think
of you in this lavender gown the violets
and these saucy nod ing feathers just as
you stand You au surely come back
to us
Perhaps
Being a woman she could not cry to
him but must stifle the pain and defy the
might have been as sho saw this man drift
ing out of her life Ones heart does not
break in these modern days
Smiling bravely she went wearily up
the steps then paused Taking a few of
the violets she kissed them and turning
called to him He came hack
Somewhat confused she pinned them
on his coat
They really belong to you she ex
plained
The moon was hidden and he could not
seo how pale she had grown Going to her
room she took down a photograph softly
whispering To have loved and lost
Both hands suddenly pressed against her
heart and the tears blindly fell unheeded
as she sobbed on
He too went to his room to ponder
He knew he would miss her She had
been so jolly always ready for a dance or
a ride knowing his favorite music and
songs Now that was all over j
ing through his desk he finally found a
little package of notes Leaning back in
the deep chair he carefully removed the
elastic around them and leisurely read
over the lines Out from the sheets of one J
fluttered a withered violet It fell
ticed to tho floor In anothor he found a
tiny spray of jasamine She had worn a
great bunch of it one night This spray he
t tr c
the next morning when his request was
grant 1 with a few patient frorda They
had been at the opera and under the
magic of the music he looked into her
eyes startlod by their deep intensity He
could seo them now How really dear she
was Ah well sho would come again
He replaced the notes struck a match
carefully held it to a cigar and unfolded
the evening paper St Louis Star
Literary Interpretation
The follow ing incident occurred in the
Evansville high school A teacher of liter
ature was discussing with her class the
beautiful description of a day in Juno in
the Vision of Sir Launfal When they
came to the lines
Every clod feels a stir of might
An instinct within it that reacnes ana
towers
And groping blindly above it for light
Climbs to a soul in grass or flowers
the teacher tried to find out whether or
not tho pupils understood what the stir
of might was Various opinions were
advanced but none of them was satisfac
tory Finally a bright thought seemed to
strike a little boy His hand went up
gleefully and he almost shouted I be
lieve it was a worm Inland Educator

THE BOURBON NteWS fARIS KY TUESDAY JANUARY 31 1899
Years since there was in the city of St
Petersburg a young girl so beautiful and
lovely that the greatest prince of Europe
had he met her even in a peasants hut
might well have turned his back upon
princesses to offer her his hand and throne
but far from having seen the light in a
peasants hut she was born in the shadow
of the proudest throne on the earth It
was Marie Mcolaewna the adored daugh
ter of tho emperor of Russia As her fa
ther saw her blooming like the May flowor
and sought for her all the heirs of royalty
he cast his eyes upon the fairest the richest
and the most powerful of them and with
the smile of a father and a king said to
her
My child you are now of an age to
marry and I have chosen for you tho
prince who will make you a queen and the
man who will render yoi happy
The man who will render me happy
stammered the blushing princess with a
sigh which was the only objection to
which her heart gave utterance Speak
father she said as she saw a frown gath
ering on the brow of the czar speak and
your majesty shall be obeyed
Obeyed exclaimed the emperor I
trembling for the first time in his life Is
it then only as an act of obedience that
you will receive a husband from my
hands i
The young girl was 6ilent and concealed
a tear
Is your faith already plighted
Yes father if I must tell you my
heart is no longer my own It is bestowed
upon a young man who knows it not and I
who shall never know it if such be your
wish He has seen me but twa or three
times at a distance and we will never
speak to each other if your majesty forbids
it
Tho emperor was silent in his turn He
grew pale Three times he made the cir
cuit of the salon He durst not ask the
name of the young man
A stranger
Yes father
The emperor fell back into an armchair
and hid his face in his Lands like Aga
memnon at the sacrifice of Iphigenia
Where shall I see him said the czar
rising with a threatening aspect
Tomorrow at the review
How shall I recognize him demand
ed tho czar with a stamp of his foot
By his green plume and black steed
lis well Go my daughter and pray
God have pity upon the man
Tho princess withdrew in a fainting
condition and the emperor was soon lost
in thought
A childish ear rice he said at length
I am foolish to be disturbed at it She
i will forget it and his lips dared not ut
ter what his heart added It must be
for ail my power would be Weaker than
her tears
On the following day at the review the
czar whoso eagle eye embraced all at a
glance sought and saw in his battalions
naught else than a green plume and a black
charger
He recognized in him who wore the one
and rod the other a simple colonel of the
Bavarian light horse Maximilian Joseph
Eugene Auguste Beauharnais the duke
of Leuchtenberg youngest child of the
son of Josephine who was for a brief time
empress of France and of Auguste Ame
lia daughter of Maximilian Joseph of Ba
varia an admirable cavalier in truth but
as far inferior then to Marie Nicolaewnaas
is a common soldier to an emperor
Is it possible said the czar to himself
as he sent for tho colonel with the design
of sending him to Munich But at the
moment when he was about to crush him
with a word he stopped at the sight of his
daughter tainting in her calash There
is no longer a doubt thought the czar
tis indeed he
And turning his back upon the stupefied
stranger he returned with Marie to the
imperial palace
For six weeks all that prudence tern-
pered with love and severity could inspire

colonel in the heart of tho princess At the
end of the first week she was resigned at
tho end of tho second she wept at the end
of the third she wept in public at the end
of the fourth she wished to sacrifice her
self to her father at the end of the fifth
she was dying Meanwhile the colonel
sewing himself in disgrace at the court of
his host without daring to confess to him
self the cause did not wait for his dis
missal to return to his regiment He was
on the point of setting out for Munich
when an aid-de-camp of the czar came iox
him
I should have set out yesterday he
said to himself I might have avoided
what awaits me At tho first flash save
yoin tion Luni the thunderbolt
He was ushered into the cabinet where
kings only are allowed to enter The em
peror was pale and his eye was moist but
his air was firm and resolute
Colonel Duke said he enveloping
and penetrating him with a glance you
are one of the handsomest officers in Eu
