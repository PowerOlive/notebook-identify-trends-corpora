It was a one-day whirlwind campaign, .lasting far into thenight, long after THE NEWS hadgone to press. For that reason weare unable to give the exact figuresin the campaign. At the courthouse, headquarters of the movement, it was stated last night thatBourbon county, would, with a fewgrowers yet on the outside, reach atotal of ninety-nine per cent, of thecrop signed up.All the regular workers and everybusiness man in Paris who couldspare the time to devote to thework, was out with the solicitingsquads, and reported great success.The names and addresses of thosewho were unsigned were furnishedthe workers, who went to the homesof the growers and made personalpleas for the plan's success. The exact amount of tobacco signed up wasnot known as THE NEWS went topress last night, hut leaders in thework were of the. opinion that theestimate of ninety-nine per cent,would he very close to the mark.Just before THE NEWS formsclosed last night the best figures obtainable from headquarters were asfollows: A total of 1,576 contracts representing 9,705,764pounds of tobacco, grown on 9,225acres, had been signed up in thedrive. Sixty-five autos were employed in transporting the workersand -one hundred extra workers'were busy throughout the day hesides the regular forces.Bourbon county's going "over thetop" in the burley tobacco marketing campaign is a matter for congratulations not only for those whoworked so hard and faithfully to attain this end, but to the growers andgeneral public as well. The benefits that will accrue if the Association is a success will go to everyone who lives in a tobacco growingsection. Furthermore, it may betruly said that no movement wasever so heartily supported in allquarters. From the outset of thecampaign there were some doubtersand opponents, but it is believedevents and the ultimate success ofthe campaign convinced even those.The banks and merchants and thepress have all given their heartiestsupport to the movement, and to theorganizers and solicitors.There is, of course, a reason forthis united front. The logic of theplan and the fairness which hasbeen displayed by the organizers hashad much to do with it.The motto on the great seal of theState of Kentucky can not be betterexemplified than by the growers ofour principal money crop getting together without exception. "United westand, divided we falL" And to-dayit looks as if the tobacco growers ofKentucky are going to stand together and win a great and lasting victory. WHITE CLOVER HONEY IN SECTIONS.

Piggly Wiggly will be the wonder of the town in aday, but it will be your own pantry for the re& of the yearand the years to come.What is a Piggly JWiggly Store? It's a grocery store without clerks, withoutdelays, without confiision without delivery and other overhead expenses toyou. It's a grocery store made into a private pantry where you may alwaysfind the freshest, the cleanest, the be, and the healthiest food produdts thatanybody's money can purchase.It's not like any other store you've been in in Paris. It's a grocery cafeteria. You pick up a basket at the turnstileentrance. Pass down the well-lighted aisles where all the products of manufacturer, canner, packer and farmer aretemptingly displayed. The goods are all nationally known and "advertised brands. Easy to find and easy to-reachon the same shelf and the same place in each of the stores throughout Kentucky.Swinging tags tell the price. You pick out what you want. Do it as fast as you want to, or as slowly. No one iswaited on before yourself. You wait on yourself; choose what greens or fruit you want from the fruit stand. Openthe refrigerator pick out your butter and eggs.Then you pay as you leave. 'Fruits and vegetables are bought fresh every day. Butter, cheese, lard, bacon and other items are all arranged in aspecially designed refrigerator.The whole Piggly Wiggly store appeals to the woman who likes her f ooistuff s where everything is clean as the insideof an apple, and as untouched. It appeals to everyone because you can buy better food for less money than anywhere else in town without exception; else there would have been no need of a Piggly Wiggly Store in Paris.Buy at a Piggly Wiggly and you save the cost of clerk hire, middleman's profit, commission merchant's profit, deliverycharges and all other expenses that help to make living high.'--The idea of Piggly Wiggly is to stretch a dollar so that itdoes the work it took two dollars to do before. PigglyWiggly sets a new standard in quick service; a newstandard in Cleanliness and Quality.-ggmgggggligSglId'gyiggiaBlsIGet the Pigglya ..; : j 'i,,,tolTn ,r fthrn -a. r, - - ' N 'More FoodFor YourDollar-HighestQualityiLowestCost5""Vv-.".V,' ylliJWilTTTimi x-y.vk''aaiiEJass -3iEsaa3Sj5a5SW""" a-!

They wquld1 prefer to see wild animals and birdspermitted to enjoy their tree me unmolested. Still hunting is so deeprooted an instinct, inherited from somany generations of primitive ancestors, that it will be common practicefor many years. If it it legitimateto kill a sheep for her luscious mutton chops, it must "be equally legitimate to kill a deer or wild duck foruse as a food.Hunting takes men out of thewearisome routine of their daily life,brightening up their wits by the necessity of matching their brainsagainst the instinct of wild life.Most men return to their work refreshed by a hunting trip, with thestrength of the hills and the restfulness of the woods giving tonic totheir previously weary steps.DEATHSLife Is But A Brief Span,That All Must PayA BebiJJACKSONSylvia Jackson, two-year-oldidaughter of Mr. and Mrs. CharlesJackson, died early Sunday morning'at the family home on Winnie stret,of tuberculosis.
