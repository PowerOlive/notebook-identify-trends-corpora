IHE PEERLESS ONE" TAKEN
TO TASK.
Bryan says if his State should
l&me him a delegate to the National
Democratic- Convention and instruct
iim to vote for Gov. Edwards, of
Kew Jersey, or any other liquor
Democrat, he would not accept the
ommission. Peerless One must be
getting better as he grows older. He
ccepted such a commission, with in
structions to vote for Champ Clark

BOUHBON FARMING CONDITIONS
Due to unfavorable weather the
end of "gorundhog winter finds the
farmers of Bourbon county further
behind with their preparations for
spring and summer activities than
has been the case for a number of
years. Heavy rains last fall pre
vented late plowing to a marked de
gree and so far this spring little has
been accomplished in this line.
The extreme cold weather of the
early part of the past week, together
with a lack of protection by snow
caused the wheat crop to suffer to a
considerable extent in many in
stances.
It has been estimated by well
posted men that the farmers of this
county lost at least three thousand
lambs during the blizzard season,
which, entails a money loss of about
$35,000.
The tobacco season has closed,
and the farmers are awaiting with
much anxiety the coming of settled
weather so they may get their to
bacco beds burned for the next crop.
They have been mindful of the im
portance f'of an early preparation of
the soil, and that it is equally im
portant to set tobacco early in or
der to get the best results in growth,
maturity and color.
Country produce is more plentiful,
especially eggs,' which took a tumble
Friday on the local market, dealers
paying thirty-five to forty cents per
dozen. The retail price has been
about forty-five cents per dozen.

DEATHS.
McFADDEN.
Mrs. Charlotte McFadden, aged
sixty-eight, mother of Mrs. Robert P.
Walsh, of Paris, died at her home,
385 South Broadway, Lexington,
Saturday, shortly after midnight.
Mrs. McFadden has been ill but a
short time.
. Besides her daughter, Mrs. Robt.
P. Walsh, of Paris, she is survived
by her -husband, John G. McFadden,
two daughters, Miss Mary McFad
den, (of Lexington, and Mrs. R. B.
Rice, of Woodford county, and three
sons, Anthony J. McFadden, John H.
McFadden, both of Lexington, and
G. William McFadden, of Cincin
nati. x The funeral was held at St.
Paul's Catholic church, in Lexing
aon, yesterday morning, at nine
o'clock, services being conducted by
Rev. Father S. Augalone. The burial
took place o-n the family lot in the
Catholic Cemetery. The pall-bearers
were members of the family.
TROUBLES OF A POSTMASTER
Postmaster J. Walter Payne, just
like any other official, or business
man, has his trials and tribulations,
only he claims his share is larger
than the average person's. Talking
to THE NEWS man the other day
Mr. Payne said: "Hello, is this the
postmaster? Well, this is Mrs. Jones.
I ordered a pair of shoes from Lou
isville two weeks ago and you have
.not delivered them yet. Please look
through your parcel post packages
and let me know if the shoes have
come." That is a sample of the
many calls I receive every day. It
would require some time to look
through a large lot of parcel post
packages awaiting delivery, and find
a particular package that is causing
so much anxiety. We receive several
hundred parcel post packages daily,
and some time when the boys go out
on their routes they have all they
can do to get along under the loads
they have to carry. We aim to de
liver parcel post packages immedi
ately after they are received at this
office. If the expected package
does not arrive within a reasonable
time, the customer should place a
formal complaint with the postofftce
or write to the firm from which the
package was ordered."
. o
COUNTY PURCHASES MULES FOR
ROAD WORK.
Fifteen pairs of heavy mules, to
be used in the reconstruction and re
surfacing plans for the county,
have been purchased by vthe Fiscal
Court recently. The main thor
oughfares of the county will first
receive attention. Tliree rock
crushing outfits and seven, motor
tiucks will be kept buys getting out
material for the resurfacing' work,
and spreading it on the pikes. The
new fireproof county garage in East
Paris will be rushed to 'completion,
the " concrete foundations havlpg
been finished. A Lxn$ton firm lite
the contract for the ' prick work,
which will begin as sooj). as the ma
terial is on the ground.'
o
THE WEATHER.
Not that our people care partic
ularly about it because ttiey know
know all about it, but for the bene
fit of our readers in Florida. The
ground hog has certainly been vin
dicated.' The weather up to Sun
day was as mean as any ground hog
could wish for. Snow flurries, high
cold winds and low temperatures
made the days and nights uncom
fortable. The changes in temprea
lure were sudden and startling.
Sunday was a bright, warm day, the
one given in the succession of dafk
sray days. Yesterday was warm,
hlustry and elbudv, with a promise
of muggy weather to follow.
The Weather Bureau's predictions
for to-day are for colder weather.
But this is March, and anything is
likely to happen.
o
HITS AT AUTO THIEVES.
Senator Jay Harlan's bill design
ed to stop the growing theft of auto
mobiles, was another of the meas
ures to receive eleventh hour action
Saturday, passing the Senate with
out an opposing vote.
The bill has real teeth in it. It
not only makes it a felony to erase
or deface serial numbers on engines
or cars, but provides that it shall be
a similar crime, punishable by a
sentence of one to five years in pris
on, exen to have in possession a car
with serial number so tampered
with. Possession or control of a car
in such a condition is declared in
the bill to be prima facie evidence
t-hat the work was done by the per
son in control. The bill is by far
the most drastic legislation ever at
tempted to prevent automobile
thefts.
"CERTAIN RIGHTS."
Speaking before tfce Republican
State Convention in Louisville last
weejk, Mr. A. T.-JHert, the Republi
can' National Committeeman for
Kentucky, delegate from the State-at-large
to the National Convention,
and in brief, the Republican party
in the State, said:
"Of course, boys, -you know I can
not make a speech, but all of you
boys do know that I can do certain
things up at Chicago, and help Will
Hayes."
We wonder why the Republican
convention was not taken into Mr.
Hert's confidence as xto what the
"certain things" are thai he is to do
at Chicago. He was afraid to let it
instruct its delegates for a particu
lar candidate for the Presidency,
because maybe that might interfere
with these "certain things." He
was afraid to have men like Judge
O'Rear and Gov. Willson and Mr.
Yerkes on the delegation because
perhaps they might- not agree to
"Certain things.'
"Certain things" is rather an
elastic phrase. It might contem
plate a great deal. Will one of the
"things" be- to connect with a Cab
inet ob?
