shape of a telegram to his sister-in-law,
Mrs. Maria Lyons. The funeral

SCHULTZ.
Mr. Richard Woolfolk Schultz,
widely known among horsemen in
this vicinity as "Dick" Schultz, died
suddenly at his home near Lyndon,
Ky., last week of heart trouble. Mr.
Schultz for several years conducted
the column headed "Listen" in the

breeding fine saddle horses and where
he also conducted a riding school.

the famous sire and show horse,
Guided By Love.
Mr. Schultz was well known by
Paris and Bourbon county horse
men. He has visited Paris several
times as the guest of local horse
fanciers, who valued his judgment of
horseflesh.

Nellie Finnell. Rev. Finnell is be

YES! LIFT A CORN OFP WITHOUT
PAIN.
Cincinnati Authority Tells How to
Dry Up a Corn or Callous So
It lifts Off With Fingers.
You corn-pestered men and women
need suffer no longer. Wear shoes
that nearly killed you before, says
Cincinnati authority, because a few
drops of Freezone applied dircetly on
a tender, aching corn or callous,
stops soreness at once and soon the
corn or hardened callous loosens so
it can be lifted out, root and all,
without pain.
A small bottle of Freezone cost
very little at any drug store, but
will positively take off every hard
or soft corn or callous. This should
be tried, as it is inexpensive and is
said not to irritate the surrounding
skin.
If your druggist hasn't any Free
zone tell him to get a small bottle
for you from his wholesale drug
house. It is fine stuff, and acts like
a charm every time. (adv)

LOOKING POR PLATINUM.
A special survey to estimate exist
ing platinum fields and locate new
ones is being made by the Bureau
of Mines. It seems that the United
States produces only 10 per cent, of
its own platinum requirement. Pla
tinum is a war necessity of the first
importance, owing to its use in the
chemical branches of the munitions
industry- It is felt that the United
States should produce all its own
platinum, as there are undoubtedly
sufficient ore deposits, needing only
to be properly exploited. The Bureau
of Mines has detailed three men to
the investigation, in California, Ore
gon and the Appalachian region. At
present most of the world's platinum
supply comes from Russia.
