MORE ABOUT THE NOTED
KER ESTATE
BA-
The following clipping from a
Philadelphia pjfper. sent to THE
j NEWS, tells of another angle in the
noted iJaker estate case, in which
some time ago, several Paris "heirs"
saw visions of a -large fortune loom
ing up, ready to lop off the bushes:
"Governor Sproul denied to-day
he had promised support to a new
legal fight to reclaim for the Baker
heirs an 'estate' which includes the
site of the City Hall and the best
central real estate in the city.
"A Philadelphian, calling himself
'Mr. Rice,' has been retained for
$2,000 by the Canadian group of
descendants of the land owner, to
go after the property. 'Mr. Rice'
told William Baker, president of
the Baker Heirs, Inc., his efforts
would have the backing of Govrnor
Sproul and the political bosses of
the State.
" I don't know any Mr. Rice,' the
Governor said, 'and I never approv
ed the cause of the Baker Heirs. I
have hear about the estate from
time to time, but I am sure it is
legally impossible to claim it. Law
yers who have engaged themselves
to ifcover the estate knew that it
couldn't be done.'
"The plan outlined by 'Mr. Rice,'
when the president of the Bakers
visited this city, was reported at a
meeting of the heirs in Toronto last
week.
" 'Mr. Rice' took Mr. Baker out to
City Hill plaza to stand on some of
his own property. 'Mr. Rice' said he
would form the Finance Corpora
tion of the United States as a pre
liminary step to scooping up the
heart of Philadelphia."
There are a whole lot of people,
alas! who think we will never have
good government unless they are
elected to office.
, There is nothing more comforting,
sa'ys the village philosopher, than
picking your teeth after eating
roasting ears. ' ' ,

GREGORY
Following an illness of several
weeks' duration, due to frequent at
tacks of acute bronchitis, Mr. Rich
ard Gregory, aged seventy-five, a
well-known farmer, died yesterday
morning at his home, the old Pra
ther place, on the Peacock pike, near
this city. Mr. Gregory had been
confined to his bed but a short time,
but the disease which caused his
death had kept him a "shut-in" sev
eral weeks.
Mr. Gregory was a son of the late
Mr. and Mrs. George Gregory, and
was born in County Kerry, Ireland.
Coming to America at a tender age
he soon became imbued with all the
ideals of a true American and be
came one of the staunchest sup
porters of his adopted country. He
came to Bourbon county, in his
young manhood, and engaged in
farming, in which he was highly
successful. He was true to all the
principles that go to make a good
citizen, and his memory will be long
revered by those who knew him best.
Mr. Gregory is survived by his
widow, who before her marriage was
Miss Margaret Conway, one daugh
ter, Miss Elizabeth Gregory, chief
clerk in the office of the Paris Wa
ter Company, and one sister, Mrs.
Kate Dillawn, of Taylor, Texas.
The funeral will be held at the
Church of the Annunciation in this
city at 9:30 o'clock, to-morrow
mornng, with services conducted by
Rev. Father William Hare. The
burial will follow in the Catholic
Cemetery. The pall-bearers will be:
James Shea, John Toohey, Jno. Mc
Carthy, Thos. Conway, Jas. Higgins
and C. B. Gregory.

GOVERNOR SUGGESTS TREES AS
HEROES' MEMORIAL
In his Arbor Day proclamation,
Gov. Edwin P. Morrow suggests that
on Saturday, November 12, Arbor
Day, trees be planted in memory of
the American soldier, sailor and
marine who took part in the World
War.
The proclamation follows:
"The People of Kentucky: Greet
ings: "Saturday, November 12, is hereby
designated as Arbor Day, and those
who love Kentucky, who desire to
preserve its beauty and to conserve
its forest resources, are earnestly
urged on that day to plant trees in
their homes, along the roads and in
their fields, to give some thought
and attention to their woodlands and
the regrowth of forest life and the
preservation of that which already
exists.
"This date is fixed because it is
believed that planting at this time of
the year will be most satisfactory
and will produce the best results,
and it is also fixed following Arm
istice Day, when trees can be planted
in memory of the American soldier,
sailor and marine.
"Given under my hand, as Gover
nor of the Commonwealth, this 31st
day of October, 1921.
