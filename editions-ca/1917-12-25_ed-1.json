Our town and community was
shocked Saturday morning when it

Ward Wood and Mrs. Margaret Dor

family of seven children? one brother
and one sister having preceded him
to the grave. Early in life, with his
parents he came to Kentucky, and
located near Germantown, where his
early life was spent. On November
24, 1886, he was united in marriage
to Miss Lutie Proctor, of Sardis.
Their happy union was blest with
three daughters, .Misses. Margaret,
Edith and Hattie Wood, and one son,
Mr. Proctor Wood, who, with their
mother, survive him. In the spring
of 1915, he, with his family, moved
from Sardis to Millersburg, where
he has since resided. On coming
here he soon became active in the
Mathodist church, and also in Amity
Lodge No. 40, F. and A. M.. He is
also survived by his aged mother and
four sisters, Mesdames John Jones,
John Wallingford, Chas. Wallingford
and Susan Reese, all of Mason
county.

iu: ju a. m. at the Methodist church,

of the church, and Dr. C. C. Fisher,

THE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS.
The day before Christmas found
Paris almost smothered under a pall
of fog and rain, which came after a
promise from the weather man that
there was likely to oe snow. It did
not, however, deter the shoppers,
ho were out in force doing their
delayed shopping. Merchants report
a good business on Saturday and yes- J
terday both, and were very well sat
isfied with the two days' work. Sat-
urday saw probably the largest
crowd that has been in the city on
Saturday for some time. Many hun
dred dollars realized from the to
bacco sales were put in circulation
and found their way to the cash
registers and safes of the Paris mer
chants. One of the most delightful pre
Christmas -entertainments ushering
in the holidays wTas the "Nativity"
rendered at the Grand Opera House
by a large delegation of vocalists.

assisted by children of the city. The
progra'm embraced the sacred story
of "The Nativity," s told in song
readings and sixteen tableau pict
ures taken from the famous pictures
depicting the events that gave the
title of Christmas to the holiday
season. All the local churches and
their choirs assisted in the presen
tation of the pictures and the songs.
A Christmas tree entertainment
was given at the Baptist church at
seven o'clock last night, with a real
Santa Claus and a postofflce from
which gifts for the members of the
congregation was distributed. An.
offering from the Sunday School
classes for the poor was taken.
The postofflce was crowded to its
utmost capacity with anxious people
we had delayed packages to send to
friends and relatives. Postmaster
Payne and his assistants worked
like Torjans to relieve the pressure
on their several departments and did
good work in getting the accumula
tion out of the way.
To-day the celehration of the Sav
iour's natal day will be celebrated
with services at the churches, and in
other ways by the young people.
The majority of business houses will
close for the day, while a number
will gfrre their employes a half-hol
