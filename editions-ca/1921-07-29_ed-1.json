time, but had been able to attend to
business matters until the inroads of
the disease forced his retirement.
He was taken to the Lexington in

ed to Bracken county. He had been
a. resident of .Bourbon county for over
forty years. He was by instinct ana
training an industrious man, and by
his industry and close attention to
the most minute business detail, be
came a successful business man, who
stood high in the estimation of our
people. For a number of years he
conducted a livery and sale stable in
Paris in the location now the home
of the Bourbon Garage. For over
twenty-five years he was engaged in
the tobacco business. He won first
prize for finest tobacco at the St.
Louis Worlds' Fair in 1912. He was
a director in the Farmers' and Trad
ers' Bank of Paris, a member of the
Couer de Lion Commander?, Knights
Templar, and manyother secret or
ders of Paris.

Jr., and one daughter, Mrs. W. B. '
Patton, of Paris; four brothers,
George Peed, of Bardstown, Law

ville; four sisters, Mrs. George Diet
rich, of Cynthiana, Mrs. W. B. Jack
son, of Lexington, Mrs. Marion
Pool, of Cincinnati, and Mrs. Phoebe

ABRAM RENICK MUST PAY IN
$15,000.
Abram Renick, of Winchester, for
mer president of the McCombs Pro
ducing and Refining Company, must
pay into the treasury of the com
pany the equivalent in cash of 15,000
shares of stock at its par value, or
$15,000 Judge Samuel B. Kirby said
in a written opinion.
To an order to return the certificate
of stock, Renick claimed he had lost
the certificate, and when his excuse
was not accpeted he filed another re
sponse in which he said he turned the 4
stock over to a brokerage concern un
der some arrangement by which the
stock was taken as part compensation
for selling other stock of the com
pany, of which he was the selling
agent, and that the arrangement was
not profitable to him.
In response, Judge Kirby said:
"Whether defendant made or lost
money can have no bearing upon the
question of his liability. The stock
was issued to him as the result of an
unlawful conspiracy and was by him
disposed of to others for some advant
age to him and the stock has become
a liability to the corporation. As
the defendant cannot surrender the
certificate for cancellation there is
but one alternative; he must pay Us
par value."
Renick was recently fined $10,000
in federal court for alleged conspi
racy to defraud in connection . with
sale of stock in the company.

AUTOMOBILE HEADLIGHTS
Dazzling automobile headlights are
one of the frequent causes of acci
dents. No man can see with these
great glares coming up and filling his
eyes. A number of States are dealing
with this matter, and codes are being
adopted specifying what constitutes a
legal light.
A car with a dazzling light is a
public nuisance, therefore no car
should be permitted to leave any fac
tory until it has a lens that satisfies
a 'reasonable standard.
If each State simply tries to rega
late the headlights after the cars are
bought, a lot of illegal lenses will slip
through, as the result of failure to
make complaints and indifference of
police officers is many places. It
would-be far simpler and more ef
fective to deal with this abuse at the
factory source.

SEEKING REDUCTION ON REAL
ESTATE
A form letter explaining tax laws
and urging equalization in assess
ments was mailed out this week to
all county tax commissioners of
Kentucky.
It is contemplated, the letter sets
out, to present recommendations to
the Governor which, enacted inro
law, will re'duce taxes further on
real estate and at the same time ma
terially increase the revenue from
sources not yet bearing their just
proportion in the support of the State
government.
The total assessment of property
in 1917 was ?922,4 56,481, the com
municatidn points out, while in 1921
it was ?2, 148, 615, 627, an increase
in the assessment of 132.9 per cent.
The taxes increased from $5,073,
510.65. for State purposes in 1917 to
$7,483,915.89 in 1921, a raise of
47.5 per cent. Meanwhile the tax
rate had been reduced from 55 cents
to 40 cents for State purposes.

Longer school terms than six

tate Superintendent of Public In
struction, in a communication ad
dressed to all county school superin
tendents. "I believe that the rural child is
entitled to the same length of term as
is provided for city children," he
says. "We must see to it that every
school in Kentucky is actually
taught for at least six months. At
tendance at institute will not count
as time taught. We must constantly
emphasize the fact that schools exist
for the children alone. No salary
should be paid to any teacher in Ken
tucky for any month .unless the rec
ords show that the teacher has act
