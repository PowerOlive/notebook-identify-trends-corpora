Mrs. Mangus Rash, thefaithful president, will lay downthe staff of leadership, for a muchneeded rest.Justice, praise and appreciationare due Mrs. Rash, retired president of the Mothers' Club, who wasits originator, and :its leader forfive consecutive years. The steadygrowth and the good work the Clubhas done in i Community Service,proves that its leader was born, notmade. While residing here but afew years, no other has done moregood work for the community, noother has more friends than she,always freeTy giving her time, talent and means. Her spacious homewas thrown open to her members,and children on many and variedoccasions. Her very unselfish spiritis proven by her wish to have thetwo clubs united. Since the Mothers' Club consolidates with the Woman's Club, as the Community Service Department, when they hadgrown so large in number and instrength, is another proof of herfine character, believing that thecommunity spirit should be unity,harmony and co-operation.'The following annual report of1920-1921, shows one year of theirClub work. The Club opened lastfall as a Federated Club, with anenrollment of 135 members. Theiryear's work consisted of twelve miscellaneous programs, which made awonderful active outline of work.Besides supporting a free kindergarten, (as they had done for fiveyears) they started a reference library in the Graded School, sawthat all the school children had amedical examination by a graduateRed Cross nurse, assisted the schoolboard in seeing that the drinkingwater was made pure, and that thechildren had some play-groundequipments, and only regretted thepenny lunch could not be openedlast year.Last October they gave the schoolchildren $ "Historical Pilgrimage"to the Gov. Metcalfe home, and theNicholas county, paying all expenses. The historians who spokeon this occasion were: Mrs. W. T.Lafferty, Lexington; Mrs. SamuelH. Stoie, Louisville, and Miss Lizzie Grimes, Paris..In the. same month the Club women had the honor of having withthem Mrs. Desha Breckinridge, (deceased) who addressed them and alarge audience, on the "Responsibility of the New Voter." To theClub members, her memory will forever last, as an influential guide.On November 25 a CommunityThanksgiving dinner was served.At Christmas times, a CommunityChristmas tree was given for 200children at the Graded School. Thechildren sang Christmas carols andold Santa distributed many giftsfrom a beautifully decorated tree,which consisted of fruits, nuts,candy, dolls, tops and articles ofclothing, which were sent to thepoor.In January, the entire public wasgiven a free musical program, by theGlee Club of State University, whichconsisted of eighteen splendid malevoices.. In February the boys' homecraft exhibit at the school, theawarding of three prizes, followedby a lecture on Vocational Education by Mr. W. E. Hacker, Secretary at the Paris Commercial ClubIn March, M-".. Frank Lowry, ofParis, gave her splendid paper on"Pottery" to the Club, followed bya Club tea. April brought Mrs.Anna Ernberg, of Berea College,with her splendid address on "Fireside Industries," and her wonderful exhibit of mountain hand-work,also the exhibit of the Club members' hand-work, and a luncheon atthe home of the president. Oneweek later the school girls' sewingexhibit, in which prizes wereawarded for every grade. Maybrought the sports of the Field Dayat the school, by the Junior Department. In June the childrens beautiful pageant, was postponed untilAugust, and then directed by itspresident. The Girls' Canning Clubin 'August had to be omitted on account of the long drought this summer.. The average attendance of all themeetings was 178. The 'Club made,and gave over $650 as a benefit tothe children and community with nodebt left on hand. Their report wasone among the best reports at theState Convention at Danville lastMay.May this year's work in the Com-munity Service Department reach'the high standards of the past year'swork.A FRD3ND.FREE JERSEY CORN FLAKESOne package of Jersey CornFlakes free with the purchase oftwo.

Thiscourse has been found by some of thestrongest school systems in the U. S.to surpass all others, in content, andin psychologic treatment of the subject. Cincinnati and New Orleans,both distincticely musical cities haverecently adopted this course.The present supervisor of muchas studied for two years with Dr.Dann, who, until recently, was thehead of the department of music atCornell University.Dr. Dann on September 1, of thisyear assumed the duties of Directorof Music of the State of Pennsylvania. The music program in the Firstand Second grades, consists of matching tones, oral and written (blackboard) dictation, rhythm drills, rotesongs, dramatization, and individualsinging.The third year's work plans forthe development of a stronger senseof rhythm, recognition of note-valvesand rests, accurate sense of pitch andtone-quality, and correctness insight reading.Music Writing Book No. 1 is introduced in-the Fourth grade. This bookfills the need in the education of thechild, to make definite that knowledge which he is taught to expressorally. In the monthly lists, andsemester examinations the written-work in the writing dooks, is included in the marks given on thereport cards. The pupils in thefourth year are taught the rudiments of two-part singing, morecomplicated nutric problems, chromatics, the minor scale and themaking of original melodies.The fifth and sixth years' are devoted to more intricate tonal andmetric studies, differentiation ofscales, three part singing, memorization and biographical knowledgeof some composers.The scale taken up in the JuniorHigh School, is that of scale building and intervals. These points aredeveloped both through oral andwritten lessons. Music appreciation,c mnrfp vital Dart of the courseComposers are discussed, and Ihere.instruments, voices and compositionare classified. The Victrola andPathe machines and the records in, Qo-hnni Music Library are usedin the appreciation classes.Music is elective in the HighSchool, with the exception of theFreshman class, which has periodsfor chorus work.The number of students availingthemselves of this course is large.Elementary Theory of Music is studded, in addition to sight-reading, dictation, study of rhythms, melodymaking and appreciation.A recent test, covering all gradesin the school, disclosed the fact thenumber of monotones was remarkablysmall. This condition places Parisin the enviable list of those citieswhich are truly musical.Paris has alwayes had good musicians, and the art will certainlygrow to splendid proportions if thestandards of the Public Schools, private teachers and Music Departmentof the Women's Clubs are maintained. ,OCKEHHIAN FAMILY REUNIONNEAR CANE RIDGEThe handsome country home of Mr.and Mrs. J.

Mr. Melary willlikely be remembered by the olderresidents of Paris. His letter, inpart, follows: ""I am asking for copies of a goodParis paper of di different dates, as Iwould like to hear something of theold town where I lived so long manyyears ago."I was born and raised about amile north of Paris, on what was thencalled the old Brooks farm. Imaginemy great desire to see old Parisagain, not so much to see Paris as tosee some of my old-time friends. Iwonder how many of them are leftin the old town now. I have notheard of Paris nor from anyone therefor over thirty years, so I don't knowwho to write to, therefore I am taking this way to get some of them tocorrespond with me, if there are anyof them left there.. "Among those I well rememberwere the Connelleys, the Cains, andthe Fitzgeralds, all of whom lived inold Cottontown, and many otherswho lived in the town ofParis proper. I often thinkof our boyhood days, how weused to like to go to the old school.We wouldn't go across the street tosee some great trotting horses goaround the track, nor take in a ballgame, nor go swimming in old Stonercreek, nothing but study, study, allthe time."Well, please publish this letter,and it may be the means of gettingsome of my old. boyhood friends towrite to me.

But let that waterdrop on his forehead, drop by drop,and he will go crazy. In olden timesmen were tortured to death in thismanner.Many drops of water, runningover rock or through a valley, havedug out the gully near your home orthe deep channel of the grand canyon in Colorado.You can easily lift ten buckets ofwater, one by one. But pour theseten buckets of water into a barrel,and then try to lift the barrel andyou may ruin your back for life.There is a lesson in this, aboutnot burdening yourself with a peakload of work. You can do only &-much at a time without strainingyourself.The sensible thing to do is to distribute the load. You can carry thewhole load with ease by dividing itup but you must keep pluggingaway at it.
