DO
DOGS EVADE THl!
GRASS SECTION?
The new dog license law is keeping
part of the Agricultural Department
busy these days supplying tags,
licenses ancl information.
County Clerks are asking for hun
dreds more tags than the County Tax
Commissioners reported tfogs last
year, but aside from Clark county
these requests are Hmited to Western
and Eastern Kentucky counties.
Central Kentucky and the Blue
grass appear to be 'comparatively free
from dogs, judging from.jmodest re
ports made by' the clerks.
County Clerks in many instances
apparently have misconstrued the
law and believe lic&nse tags cannot
be issued after January 1. The
licenses can be issued at any time,
and the Clerks have nothing to do
with the penalty for failure to secure
licenses.
That is the Sheriff's duty and for
the first year they are urged to be
lenient, provided delinquents secure
their licenses when warned.
Construction of the provision that
dags running at large, not chaperon
ed by their owners or keepers, can be
taken up or killed, is causing some
trouble.
Miss May Frederickson, daughter
of Mr. Denny Frederickson, of r near
Centerville, recently sold her crop of
960 pounds of tobacco a'nd received
the high average of $71.50 per hun'
1red pounds for the crop, all of which
was raised by her.

In issuing an order that all wast
age of natural gas is to be reported
to the Government, the National
Fuel Administration pointed to Lou
isville as an example of a city where
wasteful practices in the use of this
commodity were indulged in. -
When the supply of natural gas
failed at Louisville last winter, says
the Fuel Administration, it was
found that 1 9-10 per cent, of the
consumers were using 30 7-10 per
cent, of the natural gas. This was'
due in part to the consumption of
natural gas in converted or coal fur
naces, which, according to fuel offi
cials, is a wholly improper ap
pliance for burning natural gas.
The Public Utilities Commission in
the different cities are now recogniz
ing this, they point out, and are pro
hibiting the use of natural gas in
I appliances not primarily constructed
for such use.
The order which has just beenJ
issued by the Fuel Administration
reads as follows: --
"It shall be deemed wasteful to
burn natural gas by means of na,ni-
beaux of open lights; to burn nat
ural gas for the purpose of outside
lighting during daylight hours; to
burn natural gas in inefficient appli
ances; to burn more natural gas than
is reasonably necessary for the pur
pose which it is intended to serve; or
to consume natural gas in any other
manner which is not reasonably effi
cient and economical. Licensees are
hereby directed to report to the
United States Fuel Administration,
all cases where consumers persist! in
the wasteful use of natural gas
BLUE BUREAU OF CENSUS ISSUES
TOBACCO STATEMENT.
The Department of Commerce
through its Bureau of Census has
made public its official statement as
required by the Cantrill Tobacco Law
showing the number of pounds of
leaf tobacco in the hands of the man
ufacturers and dealers in the United
States.
This report is very encouraging
from the standpoint of the tobacco
grower and thoroughly justifies the
high market which is prevailing
especially on -the Burley type of to
bacco. The Cantrill Tobacco Law re
quires ,sworn reports made by
every manufacturer and dealer and
tne reports made on January 1st show
that the stocks of tobacco of all
types grown in the United States are
practically the same as last year,
but the report further shows that so
far as the white Burley stocks are
concerned that there is a treimend-
OUS shortaee of TJnrlAV tnhannn
The report just issued shows that I
the manufacturers and dealers have
in stock ffty million pounds less of
Burley tobacco than they had on Jari
1 st, 1918. In fact, during the seven
years that the Cantrill Tobacco Law
has been in force, the stocks of Bnr-
The purpose of the provision, it is ley Tocco are greatly less than they
explained, is to prevent the running hav bee at any time since the law
at large of dogs which migJt destroy haeenf1,J effect- . . , .
property or injure livestock. I The statement just issued shows
. , . . . . , that the manufacturers and dealers
$,$?!! 7 rVnSti!nCe simpIn January 1st had only 13,000,000
taking the air and attending to!pounds of Burley on hand whereas
his own business, is not game for any on January 1st, 1918 they had 177,
offlcer, provided the dog wears the00o,000 pounds, and on January 1st,
tag- " j 1917 had 188,000,000 pounds, so it is
,Curfew sounds for the dog, how-J very evident that the demand by
ever, at sundown, and from that the consumers of tobacco has been
time until sunup he must keep within steadily increasing for the Burley
bounds, else the "goblins will get type and consequently the stocks in
hp1-" the hands of the manufacturers and
V
I dealers have been steadily decreasing
uiiui tneir stocKs are lower than even
in the history of the tobacco market.
This makes it very evident that the
high prices now being paid for Bur
ley tobacco will continue, and in fact
it would not be surprising if prices
went still higher.
The Cantrill Tobacco law has
been in effect now seven years and
the statements made by the Burley
of Census under that law are accept
ed by the entire tobacco trade of the
United States as being thoroughly
correct, and the statement issued
is certainly very encouraging to the
growers- of tobacco in the United
States and especially to the growers
ot the Burleytype.
