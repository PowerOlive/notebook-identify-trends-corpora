One of the bills before thelegislators seeks to skrike out the lawholding directors of racing ascciationspersonally liable for betting at thetracks. Another defines 'bockmakingwithcut"v?iitin,' which was incoi pirated into the statutes on the recommendation of Governor Hughes asmeaning the Maying or pnblishirg ofodds to all comers.'"The contention of th-sa who supported Governor Hushes is that theobvious purpose of the proposed legislation is to restore raca track gambling. "On the other hand Richard T.

Base Ball.That heavy batiing which has beenthe wonder of fans and the despair ofpitchers since the opening of the 1911base ball season will be somewhat curtailed by natural causes in the nearfuture. Without becoming too explicitor attempting to pry into the tradesecrets of the manufacturers ot haspballs, it cannot be questioned that thenext supply of balls for the clubs ofthe major and minor leagues will notbe as lively as the one3 now in use. Inother words it will be deadened. According to a factory representative thepresent lively ball which is breakingdown the fences and produced 367 runsin three day3 in the major leagues wasdue to a tip from the base ball powersthat there was not enough batting tosuit the fans. Now the tip has goneforth again that fans are being heid atthe games until they get cold dinnersbecause of the gieat increase in batting. It is not intended to revert tothe old ball which produced so manyfew hit contests and made manychampionship affairs merely a oattlebetween m'tchers, but to strike a happy medium about the middle groundbetween the old oall and the new.ONE WEAK SPOT.Most Paris People Have a WeakPart and Too Often It'sthe Back.$30,000,000 Raisements.in AssessThe State Board of EqualizationTuesday practically completed thework for this year and the totali amount of " its raises in assessmentswill be right at S3u,000,000 over thecounty assessors return.

The program-was in twoparts, classical and heavy, but as ourpeople are not only accustomed togood music but enjoy the best the con-was the "Rights of the Child," andthe trend of his argument was alongthe deficiency of school work in Kenlucky, revealing some remarkable circumstances! He stated early in hisaddress that less than fifty per cent ofthose of a school age between eightand twenty years were in school. Thenumber of children in the statcofthese ages are eight hundred thousandwhile only about three hundred thousand are in schools. That the averageschool house in the country districtswas an ill contrived unsightly building, usually placed on a barren piceof ground which was void of gras3tree or flower and badly ventilated.Another astounding feature of hisaddress was that should every child ofschool age desire to go to school onone day there are not enough schoolbuildings in the state, including ourcolleges, seminaries and academics toaccommodate more than three-fourthsof them.
