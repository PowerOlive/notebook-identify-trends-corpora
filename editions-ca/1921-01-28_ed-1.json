hay and other grain crops to take
the place of tobacco. It is expect'!

in this county this year. Farmers
are being urged to take up live

WITCH-BURNING TIME
(Cincinnati Enquirer)
Modern would-be understudies of
the blessed saints are forging for
ward in their crusade to redeepn
ihis wicked world, so far at least as
America is concerned.
A member of the Tennesse Gen
eral Assembly is one of these
anointed servants of super-virtue.
If his proposals are carried into
effect we shall bid good-by to Sun
day baseball and all other games;
no more shall we read a Sunday
newspaper, nor ride on the steam
or trolley cars, nor yet in the fes
tive automobile; theatres and movie
houses will be closed; there will be
no barter or trade of any kind
whatsoever. Here is a choice bit
from this new evsngel now sweep
ing the country under the auspices
of the Anti-Saloon League spirits:
"Too long have the people of the
earth clung to the fleshpots, and
their doom is as certain as that of
Tyre and Sodom. Europe is the
Sodom and America the Gomorrah,
and only the immediate return to
the Puritanical religious precepts of
the witch-burning days fan save the
earth from destruction."
It clearly is to be seen that this
apostolic prophet nf doom would re
joice in lighting the faggots of the'
funeral pyres whereon the unregen
erate should die.
This s talk merely a bit more ex
treme than now is heard on every
hand. But it represents the logical
outcome of this menace to democ
racy if peimitted to have its intoler
ant way. This man and all his
kind represent something that was
thought to have been banished forever-
from the world. He invokes
dissensions, hatreds, intolerance, all
the black brood of evils which
cursed the earth Jirough eighteen
bloody centuries. And he speaks
this creed openly in America!
Rev. Dr. Niles Csrpenter, of Har
vard University, is not of the ilk of
the Tennessee divinity legislator.
He recently declared that Sunday
blue laws were un-Christian. He
finds in recent schemes for social
reform all the essential elements of
Bolshevism. He asserted that it was
not Christian for any minority to de
cide what was best for a majority.
that 3uch policies savor of Bolshev
ism, leading to such movements as
the blue law movement and the ear
ner restiictive laws in this country
and England. J

.The glee with which some Demo

variable and fluctuating rumors
from the haunts of the President

Hert, of Kentucky, will not be a
member of the 'Cabinet is incompre
hensible, except as a manifestation
of partnership as petty as it is pro

be a signal honor for Kentucky tc
have one of its citizens in a positiom
of such distinction in the place of a
citizen of another State, with no
greater qualifications. If Kentucky
