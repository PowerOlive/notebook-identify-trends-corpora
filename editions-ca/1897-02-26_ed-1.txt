aspoiled child and so to a spoiled manthat baby boy and man arrived at thelast mentioned stage about the timeClarence Parker reached his twentjftf th year His father left this scene ofearthly change when Clarence was ayoungster of two years andbis mother the sweetest tempered little woman to be found immediatelycommenced a system of indulgence admirably calculated to make a milksopci her only son and the heir to his fathers large estateThat he did not grow up vicious wasprobably due to the fact that lie fairly idolized his mother and would nothave grieved her for any amount ofself -gratification Also it must be confessed because he was too indolent tocare to seek pleasure that did not fallacross his path- lie had been educated by a private tutor till he entered college had graduated there and traveled through Europe with his motherMrs Parker was a little woman amere mite beside her tall stalwart son-who called her by a thousand pet dimrnutiveu names in half a dozen languages She was blue eyed fair hairedand daintily pretty neat to the extremeol nicety gentle low voiced and exquisitely feminine yet withal- with awell stored mind and an intellect thatmade her a charming companion evenfor her college fledged son Many asuitor had tried to wjn her from herone devotion but in vain All her lovethat was not her sons was buried inhis fathers grave and she never

and lovely as yourself madremia he would say 1 will moveen and earth to win her Until then letme enjoy my libertyIt was in the late spring and MrsParker was preparing for her annual vv moval to her

ChestnutHill but you can come into the city tomeet herCertainlyAnd at the appointed time in a faultless suit of summer gray Mr ClarenceParker drove his carriage and coalblack horses to the depot The

gray linenwith a plaid shawl on her arm walkedpast him to the dressing room with afree graceful step and poise of herglorious head eminently suggestive ofcountry life in the westShe is a perfect squaw

hadnothing but gingerbread and applessince yesterday noonThere was no resisting such an appeal and Clarence led the way to thedepot restaurant and offered his cousinthe bill of fare It being one of hisgreat points in feminine perfection thatthe appetite should be delicate andneeding coaxing he was absolutelyshocked to see Myra Delano eat Suchan indiscriminate jumble of provisionswould have made his mother ill fora month but Myra heartily enjoyedsteak eggs coffee pie rolls cakesoysters anything and everything asthe waiter put it before herShe was not rude did not eat withher knife or fingers but she had notone of the little dainty tricks of manlier that made Mrs Parkers table etiquette so charming and Clarence trifling with his own luncheon wonderedif in six meals he could eat as much asthis squaw ate in one In his own1 have -said he was spoiled and in a I the maid would protestI cannot breathe all pressed up soCousin Clara Myra would remonstrate I should stifle in an hourIt was difficult to compromise butMrs Parker by exercising the patienceand gentleness natural to her finallypresented Myra with a well chosenwardrobe that gave her the freedom oflimes and movement she craved andyet set off the magnificent figureThe girls own utter ignorance ofdress amazed the little woman of fashion She found that a half yearly visitto the nearest town an order to thedressmaker to make warm dresses forwinter and cool ones for summer comprised Myras idea of dress Scrupulously cleanly she was absolutely without vanity and as pleased an a childto note the improvement in her looksproduced by a becoming arrangementof her abundant raven hair and thetasteful brooch of bright color in hertastefully appointed dressThe first time Clarence saw her in adress of black silk tissue with a dashof vivid crimson here and there at thethroat in the glossy braids of hairthe sash and sleeve knots he was absolutely amazed at her beautyIf only she was not such a savagehe thought regretfulBut there was not one hour of the daythat she did not jar upon his fastidiousideas He rode with her atherTequestand told his mother confidentially thatlie never imagined anything butan Indian

givingno jar to Clarences fastidious tastethough he wished her tone more subdued But her dawdy hat her cottongloves her stout leather boots her untidy hair were all an offenseIn his first hour alone

anirresistible charm jnthe verj frankness of her manner thedaring of her movements that- werefree as ia childs but never awkward orabrupt She was absolutely ignorantof all feminine pursuits knew nothingof sewing housekeeping or the numberless accomplishments that made MrsParker so fascinating And yet she hadan instinctive avoidance of any uncouthor rude speech or act As Clarenceonce told his mother she was thoroughly gentlemanly She told Mrs Parkeronce in a sudden fit of shamef acednessfor her ignorance of womanly dutiestha t she never knew a lady Her fatherwas not willing to have her

Shechallenged him to races shootingmatches pedestrian -trips and fairlydrove him about by the laughing lashof her wittv tongueIt was curious to note how they came Iby degrees to a level the one

Myra walking in upon her husband one morning announcedClaire I have been to see your moth-He sang with her and found that he er and father -was there and-must actually exert himself to prevent jhis

JournalPUTTING HORNS ON A VIPERFaked Animals Tliat SuccessfullyFool the PublicThe painted sparrow trick hy whichsimple people are inveigled into buyinga worthless bird in the belief that theyare xurohasing a rare foreign songsteris well known It is perhaps the mostflagrant example practiced in this country of the art of preparing animals f orsale so that they may appear otherthan they are Strange stories are alsotold of the misdirected ingenuitysometimes accompanied by crueltyemployed in faking animals for exhibition in order to deceive the judgesand secure for the birds or beasts exhibited prizes to which on their merits they would1 not be entitled Butall the stories of faked birds dogsand cats fade into insignificance whencompared with the sublime audacity ofthe genius who fitted one of the cerastes vipers now in the rep le house ofthe Zoological gardens Regents parkwith a pair of artificial hornsIt is well known that in the malesand also in some females of this deadly African snake there is a little abovethe eye a hornlike process covered withscales which accounts for their popularname of horned vipers Presumablynative collectors obtain a higher pricefor these reptiles when the horns arepresent than is paid by the dealers forspecimens without these adornmentsfor the storv is current that art hasoften- covered the deficiencies of natureand supplied horns to creptiles whichwould otherwise have been hornlessOne of the horned vipers now in theZoological gardens shows that there issome foundation for the tale Twosmall spines perhaps those of a hedgehog or the tips of porcupine quillshave been deftly inserted in the skin ofthe venomous reptile in the place wherethe true horns ought to be Thefraud must have been attended withconsiderable danger to the perpetratorIt could have been no easy matter tohold a venomous snake to make two incisions in the skin and to insert thespines therein It was probably donewhile the neck of the viper was held between the index finger and thumb of theleft hand thus leaving fihe right handfree for the insertion of the spinesDirectly the attention of the visitor isdrawn to the fact by the keeper of thereptile house the difference betweenthe true and false horns is so startling that one is surprised that the fraudescaped detection for a- moment Asmay be seen from other specimens inthe same case the true horns harmonize with the coloring of the scalesof the head and bend backwards in agentle curve while the false ones showdark and light bands stand up almostvertically from the head and slopeslightly outward from base to tip It issaid that snch frauds aire by no meansrare This however is probably thefirst instance of a cerastes viper fittedwitili false horns having found itsway into the zoological collection of alearned society London StandardSeeing Rislit Side UpThe lenses of the eye produce on theretina an inverted image of objectslooked at and the question is oftenasked Why do things appear rightside up when their images are wrongside up It occurred to Mr Strattonof the University of California to trythe effect of preventing the inversion bymeans of images on the retina Thiswas accomplished by means of an optical instrument which excluded from theeyes all light except that which passedthrough the instrument itself The instrument was adjusted to the eyes- atthree oclock one afternoon and vvanot removed except at night when theeyes were bandaged until noon tilenext day At first to the person whoseeyes were thus treated everythingseemed topsy turvy and illusory andthe mind instinctivcl tried toimagineobjects to be in the position in whichthey ordinarily appear After a timehowever the feeling of unreality ofwhat was seen passed away and theperson experimented on even began toimagine everything that 2ay outside hisfield of vision to be arranged in thesame way as what he saw This goes toshow that habit and experience counteract the effect of the inversion ofimages

inprices passes A lamb not meeting therequirements of the market at thatperiod must pass on into a cheaperIass not to find sale until anotherreason opens which calls for a lamhthree or five months old but at a lessprice per poundThe lambs sold at four months olddo not as a rule bring as much asthose sold t two months old If againthe age is doubled or tripled the market into which thev must go is suchthat in spite of their gain in size theywill bring little if any more per headthan at either of the former pricesThis may be continued until we havethe sheep at its maximum weight andthe price per head does not vary greatlyThere is an imoressive lesson inthis that has not found general application in the growing of mutton Thelesson is not however that all muttonshould he marketed in the form ofeight-weeks-old lambs Not all thesheep raisers are rightly situated respecting market or equipped in skillor stable accommodations for producing this class of mutton But thisteaching is of general application thatthe younger a sheep can be marketedwhen grown under the most economical conditions for meeting a certain market for choice form the larger will bethe profit To illustrate again by

FieldCLOVER AND STOVERTwo Feetls Tliat AVorlc Together withExcellent ResultsIt is only natural to expect that afarmer who is progressive and economical in one department of hiswork will be equally progressive in another Farmers who are raising cloverare the ones who are most likely to testthe value of shredded fodder And wellmay they for they two work togetherwith excellent results In referring tocorn fodder generally and in comparison with other cattle foods a writer inthe Breeders Gazette saysOn every corn farm there should begrown as many acres of clover as cornAn average crop of corn fodder is 2tons per acre An average crop of cloverhay is 1 tons Corn fodder costs in thebarn about 250 per ton Clover hayabout the same A ton of a mixture oistover and clover then costs 250Timothy hay has sold readily at thebarn for some years at ten dollars andupward If a ton of the clover andstover mixed half and half is equal tGa ton of timothy hay for growing coltscattle or sheep the long neglected cornstalk mixed with the hay of our renovating crop becomes a very valuablearticle Experiments which we havenot space to repeat have shown that oneton of stover and clover half and halfwill produce as much growth on steersas one ton of timothy hay As timothysells for ten dollars per ton -at our barnthen the ton of stover and clover isworth ten dollars or four times as muchas it costs us in the barn K timothy isworth ten dollars a ton to feed steersthe mixture of stover and clover inuslbe worth the same But the fact istimothy is not worth that amount forfeeding steers since we have as good afeed for growth that can be jjrodueedfor half that timothy will sell for Cornstover then has so much value that wecannot afford to feed timothy hay andlet the cornstalks go to wasteCure for

the dilemma of the Royal Geographical society of Australasia It asked theInternational Geographical congressin London last year to give an answerto the question What is the true definition of the term Australasia Thecongress being very busy with othermatters had no time for this conundrum and the question is still unansweredThe Australian geographers declineto accept the British definition of theword as given in the imperial statutewhich declares that the term Australasia shall signify and include Xew Zealand and Tasmania as well as Australia Why aslc the Australian geographers should New Guinea FijiNew Caledonia and the other islands ofthe South seas be excluded In factno geographical society and few writers accept the British definition butconfusion arises because everybodyuses the word according to his own ideaof Avhat it embraces The Australiansthemselves have tried in vain to reacha common understanding A geographical conference at Melbourne in 1881argued the question but failed to attain any conclusion and none has beenarrived at since though the great society with its branches in all the leading colonies said in its memorial to theLondon congress that we consider ita matter of daily increasing importanceThe fact is there are few acceptedboundaries for parts of the- Avorld considered in a geographical instead of apolitical sense What is the geographical the so called natural division between Europe and Asia in the southeast One famous authority says it isthe ilanytsch depression north of theCaucasus another that it is the linefollowing the crest of the main Caucasus range and still another that itis the southern boundary of TransCaucasia and the latest edition of Bevolkerung der Erde which deals withthe matter gives three determinationsof the total area of Europe accordingas one or other of these boundary linesis acceptedThere is no agreement even as to thenumber of continents for some distinguished writers recognize onlythree Euro Asia Africa and Americaand- when they talk of the great divisions of the land surface the numbervaries from five to eight according todifferent writers Perhaps in only onerespect is this a matter of much importance When a writer or speaker refers to a region it is highly desirableto know how much of the earths surface he includes under the nameUntil half a century ago there wasmuch confusion in books and atlaseswith regard to the names and extentof the various oceans The Royal Geographical society of London appointeda committee in 1845 to settle these matters and the conclusions reached by thecommittee with some modificationswere generally accepted and haveproved advantageous There is muchless contusion with regard to the namesand extent of land surfaces but such asexists is not likely to be remedied unlesssome authoritative tribunal takes thematter in hand and the rest of the worldaccepts its decisions N Y SunFORCE OF HABIT AND INSTINCTExperiments in lliolosy That Illnsstrate Natural IncongruitiesProf Lloyd Morgan the well knownbiologist has just published the resultsof experiments and observations madeby him on the influence of habit on insl inct in animals Habit is defined bythe professor as action or conduct stereolyped on the individual by repetitionwhile instinct is twofold namely inherited instinct comprising congenitally definite faculties and innate capacity and acquired instinct leadingto the formation of habit Both habitand instinct are automatic althoughlike such automatic acts as breathingand walking they may become subjectto conscious cerebration or action of thewillIt is instinct which when a hen hashatched a brood of ducklings throwsher into a terrible state of agitationwiien the brood also actuated by instinct takes to the water What experience asks Mr Morgan has the henof drowning To adopt such an interpretation is to credit her with powersof anticipating the results of experience which it is hard to conceive shepossesses It is more probable that herfussy behavior is partly the result ofher little ones going where she has aninstinctive aversion to following themand partly the result of a breach ofnormal associations due to previous experience with chicks Two instancesare recorded of hens under the impulseof habit Each had reared three broodsof ducklings in succession while thefourth brood of each consisted oichickens One of the hens used to flyto a stone in the pond and remain therewhile her ducklings swam around herWhen her chickens were hatched sheflew to the accustomed stone and calledeagerly to them to follow her but invain The other hen finding her chicksdid not take to the water like her former broods had done took them downto the stream and pushed them in Imitation begets habit and habit becomesinstinctOf all British nest builders nonesurpass the chaffinch for its artisticnests yet the chaffinches naturalizedin New Zealand having no nests of theirown to copy have imitated those oihang bard Instinct prompts them tcbuild nests but imitation is called inccplay to decide the style Reason whichused to be ranged as the antithesis oiinstinct is now largely regarded asynonymous with it Yet

Up AgainFrom the Gazette CMUicothex OhioMr Elbridge Waterman is a well knownrailroad engineer of the Baltimore and OhioSouthwestern Railway who has been agreat suffererfrom nervous debilhy of anaggravated kind for the past ten years Thestrain was telling on his nerves terriblyand steady work was impossible The folio wing is his storyFor the past ten years he said I havesuffered as few men have with nervousness heart trouble and rheumatism I havelived on the footboard most of my life andthe constant jolting and nervous strain3lovly but surely undermined my constitution I was forced to quit work and thereseemed to he little prospect of my goingback to the throttle again I tried everyremedy that I could find but none ofthem did me any good I consulted doctorsall over the country but to no avail I wouldbebetter for a time and then would comeon an attack more severe than ever and Iwould have to quit work The money Ibave spent during thatime for doctors andmedicine none of which did me any permanent good would place me now out ofwant and in comparativeafnuence if Iliadit An idea of how much time and money Ilost may be gained when I tell you that during last summer alone I was totally unableto work four months on a stretch and wasmuch of the time confined to the house andto the bed sometimes unable to move Itmakes me cold all over when I look back onWhat I have gone throughBut rheumatism was not the only thingI suffered from My heart troubled me verymuch and I was totally unable to sleep fordays and weeks at a time When I woulddrop off into a doze my heart would beatitseii almost out oi my bosom and wouldwake me up as though I had been struck bya trip hammer I had twitchings in myarms and legs and was altogether in suchacondition that my wife and friends began toconsider me beyond reach of medical assistanceI was almost of the same opinion myself when I happened to see in the paperlast June a letter from an old soldier iu thewest who had been cured of rheumatism byDr Williams Pink Pills The testimonialwas written in such a way that I knew itwas not a faked up one and I determined togive this medicine a fair trial I was unable to work at the time and almost in despair So I went to the drug store andbought six boxes of them in order to givethem a thorough test and in a few days Ibegan to feel the improvement they wereworking in my system In two weeks Iwas able to go to work and I have workedever since without a lay off which is something I have not done for yearsThe first improvement I noticed was inmy heart which grew more and more normal in its action until at last it did nottrouble me at all and I was able to sleep asI had not been able for ten years The hearttrouble has never returned and my sleepfor the past two months has been healthyand deep Last night I went to bed earlyand slept soundly until eight oclock tiiismorning And now when 1 wake up I feelinvigorated and ready for the days workjust as I used to leel wneu I was a boyThe nervous twitchings were also curedin a short time and have never returned orbothered me in the least since This hasalso been a great relief to me as tlie twitch-mgs were very annoying as well as an indication to everyone of the terrible conditionin which my state of health was And thegreatest wonder of all is thatthe rheumatismseems to be cured also and does notr botherme in the least any more except when I expose myself unduly and even then only fora short time 1 consider myself a well mannow and hope to continue so I am stilltaking Pink Pills for I want the cure to bea complete and
