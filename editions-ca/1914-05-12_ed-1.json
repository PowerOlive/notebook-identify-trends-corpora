The graduation recital in piano of
Misses Gertrude Patrick and Stella

Auditorium Saturday at 8:00 p. m.
The spacious auditorium was well
filled with relatives and friends of the
young ladies. The program was
classical and well rendered. These
young ladies hrave been untiring in
their efforts through several long
years of their musical carreer, and
Saturday night gave good evidence of
pression and faultless tones were far
above the average. It was an" inter
esting program inasmuch as both of
the young ladies were graduating.
Of course their numbers alternated,
and it gave the musical critic oppor
tunity to watch the various points of
both performers. They received nu
merous flowers and other presents,
;and were the recipients of showers
of congratulations. They were as
sisted by Misses Marie Smith and
Mary Bruce Redd, as readers, who
also did their work nicely. After the
recital a short reception was held in
the library and parlors of the college
wher everyone was given an oppor

ed to the public to attend all the

The" past session has been exceed
ingly pleasant and satisfactory in
every way. The most delightful har
mony has prevailed among teachers
and pupils, and 'the work accom
plished by both has been highly sat
isfactory. Plans and specifications have been
made for extensive improvements
during the approaching vacation.
These improvements will consist of a
first-class gymnasium, 46x72 feet,
swimming pool of the same length,
shower baths, art studio, literary so
ciety hall, flower conservatory, and
additional dormitory room for about
thirty pupils. With these improve
ments there will not be a boarding
school in the State more up-to-date
and better equipped for the work to
be accomplished.
At the meeting of the committee
held in Lexington last January, twenty-six
High and Secondary schools
were put on the "accredited list,"
these schools being divided into two
classes, A and B, and then graded ac
cording to merit. The Millersburg
Female College stood at the top in
Class A, with possible credits, 25.
This means that the M. F. C. stands
above all the other schools of its kind
which were put on the "accredited
list." With these facts before them,
we look for our old friends to remain
loyally and enthusiastically true to
us, and also to enlarge our circle of
friends until all our rooms are filled
to their capacity with earnest, honest
pupils whose highest aim is to be ac
complished, educated Christian wom
en. We have never had as competent
a faculty as we have had during the
past session, and we are happy to
announce that the faculty for next
session will remain almost the same
as for last session. We appeal to our
alumnae and all friends to aid us in
filling our rooms to their capacity
with a high grade of pupils. It is our
purpose to gradually advance our
course of study until those graduating
from the M. F. C. will be able to enter
the Junior year in the best of colleges
and universities of the North and
East. Please send us names of pros
pective pupils. .
Cordially,
C. C. FISHER, President,

various base ball teatns to compose
the Sunday School League was held
Saturday afernoon in the offices at the
Peoples' Bank and the schedule for
the season was adopted. The meeting
was a very interesting one and much
enthusiasm was manifested.
When the league was organized a
week ago only five points in the
county were represented, and it being
necessary to have six clubs in the
league to work the schedule to an ad
vantage, it was decided to have two
teams iin this: city and accordingly
the Loyal Sons, an organization com
posed of the young men of the Chris
tian Church was added to the league
membership.
The first game of the season will be
played on Saturday, May 30. The
schedule as arranged is as follows:

TUBERCULOSIS IN THE ORIENT
IS SERIOUS PROBLEM.
Tuberculosis is one of the most se
rious health problems in the Orient.
Active organizations to fight this dis
ease have been formed in Japan, the
Philippines, India and Australia. A
movement is on foot for a national
organization In China and in a number
of cities local work has been started.
While no accurate figures are availa

know claim that consumption takes
annually from 5,000,000 to 10,000,000

WARNING AGAINST DANGEROUS
PRESERVING POWDERS.
The attention of National Depart
ment of Agriculture has recently
been called to the widespread use, es
pecially in rural communities, of sal
icylic acid in putting up preserves.
The head of a large drug and chemical
supply house states that people living
in Southwest Virginia, North and
South Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee
and Western Georgia, have been pur
chasing salicylic acid in one-quarter
pound packages for a number of years
and that this practice has grown to an
enormous extent. This dealer states
further that only a few weeks ago he
received an order from one wholesale
grocer for fifty gross of these goods.
The department is aware that this
practice is not confined to salicyic
acid under its own name alone, but
that large quantites of this acid, and
of boric acid as well, are sold under
fanciful names as preserving powders
or canning compounds at prices which
are much in excess of their real
value.
In the directions for use, the house
wife is told to fill the jar with the
fruit or vegetables, cover with water
and add a teaspoonful of the powder.
It is true that these powders may
prevent the decay of the fruit or veg
etable, but they also encourage un
cleanly "or careless work, and their
excessive use may be attended with
very serious results upon the health.
Salicylic acid is a medicine of the
greatest value in acute articular rheu
matism and certain orther diseases. It
is well known as a poisonous sub
stance, and one of the evils which may
accompany its use in derangement of
the digestion. It is therefore plain
that its extensive use in food may lead
to disturbance of digestion and health.
It is entirely practicable to put up
both fruits and vegetables in such a
manner that they will keep indefiin-
ltely by seterilizing the products by
means of heat, and there is no excuse
for running any risk by the using of
preserving powders. The Department
of Agriculture has issued the follow
ing Farmers' Bulletins dn canning and
preserving:
F.. B. 203 Canned Fruit, Preserves
and Jellies.
F. B. 359 Canning Vegetables in the
Home.
F. B. 521 Canning Tomatoes at
Home in Club Work.
These bulletins, which may be ob
tained without cost by applying to the
Division of Publications of the De
partment, give exact directions for
canning and preserving foods without
the use of preserving powders or can
ning compounds.
COLORED HIGH SCHOOL NINE
LOSES TO CYNTHIANA CLUB.
The Paris colored High School base
ball team was defeated by a team from

terday afternoon by a score of 9 to 8.
The game was very exciting.
superstitions, the problem of preven
tion and treatment is peculiarly diffi
cult. The Japanese has taken a hand
officially in the control of tuberculo
sis, and is co-operating with two well
organized private associations. The
death rate while very high, is lower
than in China and India. Under the
direction of the United States Public
Health Service a movement for the
prevention of tuberculosis in the Phil
ippines has also been organized.
The National Association for the
Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis,
with headquarters in New York, al
though organized especially for work
in this country, has been largely in
strumental in the establishment of
anti-tuberculosis movements in most
of the Oriental countries, as well as
Africa and South America.
