anyoEC who chose t address himand seemed to possess a wonderful memoryfor even the mct trilling details This wasin fact an mlor iial reception which the cardinal Loth as y prince of the church andthe representative of Prance at the PapalCourt held and hither came all thelesser members of the French party inRome and all those who hoped to gainsomething from the prelate by the simpleprocess of asking for DAmboise wa knownto be generous and lice despite an occasionel testiness of manner such as he had exhibited to Corte and shown in the first instance to St ArmandeCorte I spoke to no more that day but Isaw him where he had retreated to the extreme end of the room his book under hisarm evidently waiting to make his exit StArmande took his place beside me his companion the abbe dropping into the rearOnce he St Armande hazarded a remarkwhich I did not catch and therefore did notanswer In truth 1 was in no mood forpeaking my mind being lull of my eventfulInterview with the ardinal and JJayard ami1 was more than grateful for the happy-chance that had enabled me to draw myword in aid of the secretary MachiavelliI thought too of Mme DEntrangues andof what -he had done in my behalf andMould have given much to have thanked herfor her eliorts fruitless although they apparently were But what struck me mostof all was the fact that whilst in my miseryat Florence I was upbraiding fate and allbut cursing God friends were at work trying to help and aid me and this taught me alessonAt last the levee came to an end The lastpetition monger had made his requestJAmboise had made his last pleasantspeech and turning slowly round wemade our way back when the cardinal retired with Bayard to an inner apartmentleaving us to our own devices St Armande whose appearance attracted generalattention was surrounded by the gentlemenof the suite who asked the last news of thecouit and the last scandal of Macon whereLouis was holding high revelry instead otmarching as he should have done at onceto Italy alter the defeat of Cesareat Fsombrone The result of his action being afurther truce that much delayed his successand indeed cry nearly ruined his chanceswhich were great at the time As for me Iwas lift to myself no one coming nea J meexcept the huge hound which rose slowlyand approaching surveyed me with graveinterest Then apparently satisfied hewagged his tnil in approval and touched myhand with his grim muzzle I ran my lingers over his shaggy coat with a caressingmotion and observing Defame the pagewhom I had iirst addressed on arrivingbegged him to show me my apartments inquiring at the same time of Jacopo and thehorsesThe house is full signore he repliedbut we have done what we could for youraccommodation The horses have been attended to and the Sergt Jacopo awaits youin your roomsThanks friend and I followed himsmiling a little to myself at the French rankwhich Jacopo had assumed no doubt out ofcompliment to our host my new employerWe passed out by the same entrance bywhich 1 had come in and crossing a courtyard the page ushered me to a set of apartments in an outbuilding and left me withthe information that dinner would be servedat noon for the cardinal as well as the gentlemen of the suiteI found Jacopo in high glee He had setout all my apparel and was engaged in buinishing his sword This he put down as Icame in and burst into speechBlood of St John Excellency but didI not say luck wnuld turn Yesterday wewere anywhere end he held up both handswith the fingers outstretched to day behold and he waved his arms around theroom which wa certainly fitted with luxury and struck me as all the more luxuriousafter my past privationsThe horses JrcopoAre well as might be signore and munching their corn cs if they were never to havemother feed Does your excellency mean tostay long in this land of plentyNot for long Jacopo And harkee Kemember not to address me by any othername than that of Uonati Do not let a hintand avoid babblingof my real name escape youbling over the wine cupI will be dumb excellencyA good deal depends on your prudenceIn this and you must take care not to failNow to business and keep your cars openand your head dear How do we stand asregards fundslarono to whom I had intrusted myand I will engage them for a month and payeach man five crownsThat is at the rate of 60 crowns a yearfor each man We could enlist half Romefor thatProbably but it isnt half Rome onlyhalf a dozen men I wantVery true your worship and I willdoubtless be able to find them but excellencyWhat is itSix men at five crowns each makes 30crowns andDid I not say more will be forthcomingYou need not pay them in advance Twocrowns each on enlisting and the remainderon completion of the task Will that doIt is enough surelyVery well then you may set about thisat once and remember that they should belodged close at hand and be ready to go anywhere at a moments noticeExcellencyWhilst this conversation was going on Ihad effected such change in my attire aswas possible resolving to take the first opportunity the following day to summon atailor and give him orders for things forwhich I stood in need Jacopo was justabout to depart when Defaure the pageappeared bearing with him a note and arouleau which he said was from his eminence These hie left with me and retiredsaying there was no answer The note wasbrief merely hoping I was in comfort andsending me in the rouleau a hundred crownswith the intimation that if I needed themanother hundred was ready for me Thesum however was more than ample andgiving Jacopo further directions to engagea couple of lackeys I sent him away rejoicing at my good fortune with a present ofU u crowns for himself which the honest lellow at first refused to take and only accepted on my pressing the sum on himThis being done there was nothing leftfor me but to await the dinner hour and Istrolled down to the stables to look at thehorses which were in truth in such luxuryas perhaps the poor beasts had never enjoyed A groom of the cardinals establishment had attended to them and J slippeda piece of silver into his hand for his troubleHe bit this to test whether it was genuineor not and then settled himself on a heap ofhay to mend some- Baddlery1 left him to his occupation and with aparting caress to my beasts moved furtheron to look at the other animals And heremeeting the head groom 1 had some conversation with him admiring the cardinalsstudYes excellency he said they are goodhorses notably the two barbs which theSoldan Djem presented to his eminent e butthere are other two now in our stables belonging to the Sieur de Bayard the like ofwhich I have never seen They are thiswav excellency if you will but accompanymeI readily assented and passing by thebarbs whose slight delicate frames beliedtheir powers of speed and endurance wecame to a couple ol stalls in which therewere a pair of war horses that fully justifiedthe head grooms praise They were bothEnglish and I recognised the breed asUawkwood had brought three or four withhim from Britain saying and with truththat they were the only animals that couldever carry him when in full mail But thetwo before me in the stables were as superior to iiawkwoods as a barb is to a muleOne was the great bay Bayard was ridingon the day of my trial when he accompaniedthe duke and his stali back to Arezzo Theether was a blue roan whose color did notshow oil his size to advantage but whosebroad chest sloping shoulders and leanflanks marked his power His eyes weremild and solt yet full of fire and his smallhead was set like that of a stag upon hisstrong neck Two grooms bearing on theirliveries the arms of the house of Terrail ofwhich the Seigneur de Bayard was chiefwere in attendance and set to work with asomewhat unnecessary zeal on our appearance to polish the coats of their chargeswhich already shone like satin Whilst engaged in admiring these splendid animalsI heard the deep bay of the hound behindme and turning saw Bayard himself whohad com to visit his favorites I complimented him on the possession of two suchsteeds as who would not have done andBayard saidYes they are fine animals truly the finestI have ever seen except perhaps the oneeyed 8avoy who was also of the san ebreed and yet 1 am not sure and he ran- over the horses They were givento me along with Bran here he touchedthe head of the hound by his majestyHenry of England when I was taken prisoner in the English warA noble giftYes from a noble prince And youreally admire them cavaliereYes- and 1 knew Savoy too and doubtif he was betterWhat can knight want more A goodhorse a good hound and his face saddened a little a true love Pardieu butI must sec to that last My castle on theGaronne needs a chatelaineI said nothing knowing of the one greatsorrow of his life which he bore so bravelyand which 1 knew had bitten to his heartfor all his gay wordsCastor and Pollux I call them be saidindicating the horses with a slight gestureNot that they are alike except in speedand courage but that they are both supposed to have been born the same day andhave never been separated The best offriends must however part and a knightwants no more than one horse so cavaliereif you will accept Castor the blue roan thereyou will find that he will never fail you1 could hardly speak for the moment andat first stoutly refused to take so valuablea gift but Bayard would have no denialand the short of it was that Castor was ledinto one of the stalls reserved for meTo say that I was grateful would be to sayvery little but I will merely add here thatthe gilt itself was only equaled by the manner of the giver I accompanied Bayard intothe garden which lay to the west of thepalace and in course of conversation toldhim that I had received the sum sent byDAmboise and of the steps I had taken toget together a few men and assured himthat whatever the task was that I was to beset to perform nothing but death itselfwould cut short my endeavor ur talk thendrifted to other matters and he gave mesome information of interest concerningMme DEntrangues It appeared thatDEntrangues who had a friend at court inhis kinsman Etienne de Yesci the seneschal of Beaucaue had forwarded a strongpetition against iremouilles decision re-money pulled out a leather purse and count- j garding himself and a prayer that the kinged the contentsThere are five-and-thirty crowns withme signore and five I gave your worshipthis morning making i0 in all and hereitcred the purse to its hiding place under hisheltEnough for our needs at present anamore will be forthcoming soon for there iseasiness in hand1 bd that luck would turn repeatedacopo his face showing joy at the newsNever mind the luck but attend to meI want to enlist half a dozen good men menand do anythingwho will go anywhereThey must bring their own arms and horseswould restore him to his position and compel Mme DEntrangues to return to himAs if he himself had not abandoned herOwing to his influence with Ccsare he hadmoreover obtained an order from Alexander denying madams the refuge of a convent Eouis had however declined to interfere with Tremouilles decision but hadordered madame to leave the court and return to her husband Fearing that forcewould be resorted to in order to compel herto return to DEntrangues she had lied fromthe protection of the Duchesse de la TremHulle who denied ail knowledge of hernovements and the matter iood thereBy this time it was almost approaching thedinner hour and we separated Bayard followed close at his heels by Bran going toseek the cardinal and 1 returning to nrychamber where I found Jacopo who hadjust come back He had been to the stableson his way up and was loud in his praise ofCastorThey say he is fleet as the wind excellency and he is as gentle as a lambkin It isa glorious steed and a princely giftIt is so but what success have you hadNone as yet about the swords ignorethere has not been time but I have engageda couple of grooms and a lackey and ordered plain liveries for them The groomsare even now with the horses and the lackeywill be here to morrowYery well there is time enough BastaThere go the trumpets His eminence mustbe servedWe made our way to the dining hall entering it almost at the same time as the cardinal his guests and the rest Of the suiteAt the high table on the dais sat the cardinal with Bayard another prince of thechurch whom I afterwards found out wasthe Cardinal of Strigonia a scion of thehouse of Este and a tall somber lookingman with high aquiline features and a complexion almost as dark as a Moors He wasplainly and simply dressed wearing a lightsteel corset over his jerkin and round hisneck the ribbon of St James of Compostellawhilst the older itself a red enamel swordwith a hilt set in an oval whiteenamel medallion with a red border studdedwith brilliants flashed at his throat Hisshort closely cropped hair was white assnow but the long mustac he which droppedover his mouth and short pointed beardwas untouched by a streak of gray Altogether a remarkable man one whom no onecould pass by v ithout looking at tvu andin me he excited the greatest interest forhe was none other than ranalvo de ordovathe rcat Captain and the most skillfulgeneral of the age He had only a fvw weeksbefore driven Marshal dAubigny out of Calabria and was mat chin straight on againstTremouilie when the cassation of hostilitiesstopped his plans and suddenly resigninghis command he had come to Rome forwhat purpose no one knew although it wassaid tint his resignation and difference withthe Spanish court was but a blindBe that as it may I had now an opportunity of seeing together seated side by salethe dark and stem grandee of Spain as ableas he was ciuel as vindictive as he wasbrave and the brilliant and polished Bayard avIio seemed to have gathered in his person all the noblest qualities of knighthoodand on the white shield of whose honorthere was never a stain And how differentwas the late of these two men De Cordovaafter holding the highest offices after being practically a king after sheddingan imperishable glory on his country by his victories and staining her memory indeliblyby his perfidy died at last with all his finespun webs broken And Bayard old as Iam my eyes grow moist when I think of thatglorious day at the passage of the Sesiawhen covered with wounds overborne bynumbers and fighting to the last againsthopeless odds Pierre dti Terrail gave backhis soul to God Hut long years were topass before this happened and Bayard wasat present in the hey dey of his careerThe table for the gentlemen of the suitewas placed just below the dais and extending further down the room were othertables for all who could obtain seats thereat whilst at the extreme end of the roomwas a high stand whence anyone Avas at liberty to bear away as much of a meal as hecould carry off on the point of his daggerEstimating roughly I should say that fully300 persons dined daily in this manner withDAmboise and this hospitality which heexercised in the manner of a French feudalncble was the subject of much amusementat the papal court where they prided themselves on a more refined and delicate styleof living At any rate all that was herewas safe to touch ami no one had need tofear that a dinner at the Palazzo Cornetowith the Cardinal of Rouen was a prelude toa supper with St Peter in Heaven Iliseminence who was a notable trenchermanbeamed down from his high seat on us aand tried valiantly to assay conclusions withthe Cardinal of Strigonia but was compelledat last to own himself beaten for InpolytedEste was one in a thousand at table infact this jovial prelate ended his days suddenly after a prodigious dinner which began at 11 in the morning and ended at fourin the afternoon concluding with so lightn dainty as a dish of roasted cra fish washeddown with a bottle of vernaccia a wine ofvhich he was inordinately fond At ourown table there were about a dozen cr moreand I found m self seated next St Armandewhilst opposite to ne was Ee ere the cardinals chaplain and next to him an officerof the papl guards a Spaniard who spokelittle and ate much St Armande paby the wine drinking only water and in reply to a question of mine answered that hewas under a vowVYe n absolve J ou here easily chevalier said Ee Clerc who overheard the remark here is some Orvieto which I canrc ommend and he pushed the flask towards St ArmandeThe hitter however would not be tempted and Ee Clerc shook his headA willful man must have his own waychevalier but that Orvieto was a presentfrom Pierrot our lords most favored servantIndeed said the Spaniard then I cansafely say it is the last present you will receive from Don PierrotHow soCesare arrived last night very suddenlywith two men only they say He has nothowever yet seen his holiness althoughhe is in the VaticanLe Clerc remained silent but St Armande asked in his low voiceI do not follow sir Could you not explain Unless I ask too much You seeI am a stranger in RomeThe Spaniard smiled grimlyIt means chevalier that Pierrot wasfound this morning with a dagger stickingup to the hilt in his heartSt Armande turned pale and Le Clercasked in a low toneAre jou sure of this When did it happenAs sure as 1 sit here It happened anhour or sr after Cesares coming The popeis said to be overcome with grieV and thelips of Don Diego de Leyva took a sarcasticcurveOreat heavens said Le Clerc PoorPierrotThe chaplain rose from his seat with aslight apology and approaching DAmboiseleaned over him and whispered a fewwords in his ear The cardinal nodded withapparent unconcern and Ee Clerc cameback but watching DAmboise narrowlyI saw that although he still appeared tolaugh and jest his eyes were grave and hisbrow troubled In fact shortly afterwardsthe high table broke up and we followedsuit very soon Despite his effeminate appearance I had begun to take a liking toSt Armande and as the next few hourswere at our disposal I invited him to rideout with me as I had a mind to try Casters paces This however he declinedwith the somewhat shy air that marked hismanner and leaving him to his devices ICastor to be jdlcd and took himout When I returned about five in theafternoon I felt that all that had been saidof the generous beast I rode underrated hisvalue and that I possessed a matchlesssteed who was fit to run for a kingdomFor the next few days the routine of mylife was exactly the same the morning attendance at the cardinals levee the dailydinner in public and long rides with Castor in the afternoons in which 1 was sometimes accompanied by St Armande butthis was not always possible as he wasclosely attached to DAmboises personDAmboise frequently asked me to accompany him to the Vatican but up to nowI had begged permission to decline his invitation on the plea that with the businessbefore me it would perhaps be well for meto live as much in retreat as possible Thecardinal said with that good temperedlaugh of his which entirely belied his astute scheming nature that as I was as yetignorant of my task I need not be so careful I replied to his eminence that it wasjust because I was in the dark that I wasso circumspect and he was then goodenough to agree with me I was howevernaturally anxious to see something of theVatican and one of my reasons for refusing besides that of prudence was that 1was not sufficiently well equipped Thishowever with the funds at my disposalwas soon mended but from some cause orother I had up to now not gone Jacopowas not so successful us he anticipated hewould be in raising his men lt was aboveall necessary to have them trustworthyand it was difficult to get men of this class fora merely temporary employment such as1 offered At last the matter wca arranged and by the end of the week I mustered a body of six stout fellows all of themfairly well mounted and what was better all of them trained soldiers I hadthem lodged near the Ripetta and the cardinals table afforded them a free dinnerof which they were not slow to take advantage In order to keep them employed Itook them out with me every afternoon dismissing them upon my return with ordersto join the nightly escort of the cardinaland Bayard to and from the Vatican Isaw a good deal of Bayard and at times expressed myself with impatience at beingkept to cool my heels He told me thathe was not at liberty to mention the details of the business on which 1 was to beemployed and advised me to bide my timewith a patient heart Amongst other matters we spoke of was the murder of Pierrotand Bayard told me that Cesare Borgia hadleft Rome the next day without seeing hisfather the pope and that he was crushingout completely the stand made against himby my old chief Yitelli of Citta del Castelloand others1 took Bayards advice and held patienceby the tail although I longed for workto begin My men were in good fettle Theyhad enough work to keep them out of mischief the pay was good they had sufficient leisure for amusement and there wastherefore no grumblingLto be continuedSPURGEONS

his house While they sat in hishumble home the eminent preachersconscience smote him because his gooddeacon and himself were consumingsome of the scanty store of provisionsand he began to think of some plan bywhich they could repay the clergymanfor his hospitalityNoting that his friend was wearingan alpaca coat which was very shinyand in places so worn that he could secthrough it Spurgeon hit upon his planSo at the end of the evening service hesaid to the congregationVow dear friends I have preachedto you as well as I could and you knowwhat our Saviour said to His disciplesFreely ye have

who kepthouse for him was the orphaned childA his only daughterMr Sawyer wiped his gold bowedon his faded silk handkerchiefidjusted them carefully and began toexamine the present a large Biblerery crit ieally He was a small weazen1 old man of an extremely pessimistic temperament quite the reverseA cheery Grandpa HudsonThe print is clear he said after asurvey through GenesisW s George knew my eyes were getting dim Mr Hudson said so he sentme one with good large print I canalmost read it without my glassesBut it seems to me the binding aintoverstrong the neighbor continuedLooks as if it might come to piecesI guess it will last me the old mananswered quietly though I shouldike to leave it to Letty when Im gone1 keep a newspaper around it most ofthe timeIs that your sons writing MrSawyer asked as he turned to the firtBy leaf and gazed with wonder on thtelaborate flourishes which he finallydeciphered to mean Presented toJosiah Hudson by his son GeorgeOh no Mr Hudson replied hurriedly and 1 dont mind telling youdont let it go any further but thatsthe only thing about the book I dontjuite like I wish George had writtenthat himself for I see much ofBeorges writing he continued pa-thetically and it would be nice to havetome where 1 could see it every dayHe stopped for a moment and thenadded with an attempt at cheerfulnessBut Letty says its fashionable to havenames written that way and Georgesfolks are real fashionableAS Letty sat in the sittiug room thatafternoon sewing she noticed that herprondfather was busy at his desk Hewas evidently writing a letter and theundertaking was arduous for he bit hispen used up several sheets of paper andsueceeded In getting much ink on hisfingers before the unaccustomed taskwas doneLetty usually wrote his letters forhim and she wondered why she had notbeen asked to write this one but sheasked no questionsFrom that day for nearly two weeksMr Hudson went about with an air ofmystery He mended the few brokenplaces in the fence whitewashed thechicken house and was very solicitousas to the condition of the late fall garden Every evening he might be seenwalking to or from the townIts only half a mile he repliedto Lettys protest when this daily walkhad been kept up for a fortnight andI need exercise I dont get nearenough to do here The kindling tosplit and the cow to milk Why theyreonly play and he started toward townagain at a nimble gaitAnything for me to day Mr Joneshe asked as he walked into the postoffice trying to speak as if it were amatter of no importanceWhy yes the postmaster repliedslowly there is a letter for you aroundhere somewhere Hank Golder was justin and we were curious to know who itcould be from You dont get lettersvery often you knowBut the old man took his letter ignored the hint and went out withoutgiving any informationThink he might have been more sociable muttered the postmaster hewas storekeeper as well as he beganweighing out sugar for a customerA body likes to know whats going onIt was not until after supper thatMr Hudson found time to read his letter To be sure he had gazed at it allthe way home studied the postmarkand wondered if it was ves or nobut he would not open it till he hadplenty of time Then he read it severaltimes before he mastered the wholeI guess well get up in themorning he said to Letty as she cameout to empty the dishwaterWhy grandpa she asked in surprise Is there anything special tomorrow7Were going to have company theold man answeredCompany the girl echoed WhvwhoI could tell he answered butyoud rather be surprised would jounotOf course if youd like it that waygrandfather only I should like toknow how many are coming and justwhen Letty answered pleasantlyShe knew his weakness for surprisesOne with an appetite for two aboutsix oclock to morrow evening MrHudson went to shut the gate withoutoffering any further explanationAt the appointed time the next evening the kitchen fire was burning brightly and the kettle was sending up acloud of steam The room was filledwith the odor of frying chicken Thebiscuit were in the edge of the ovencovered with a white cloth and Lettywas so busy creaming the potatoes thatshe forgot to wonder who after allwas coming when the door opened andher grandfather and Uncle Georgewalked in1 told you shed be surprised theM t mold man said to his son misinterpretingthe look of astonishment on the girlsfaceI hope Letty enjoyed her stay inthe city George Hudson remarked tohis father as he sat on the porch aftersupper while Letty did up the dishesYes she had a good time the oldman answered but I guess she musthave got rather confused with he noiseand everything for she clear forgot allabout a new dress she had been planning all summer to buy She pickedberries to get the money You see HalMarkhams sisters going to be married pretty soon I guess Hal likes Letty pretty well he added with a slywink and Letty was to stand up withher but she forgot all about the dressHe laughed heartily at his granddaughters lapse of memory Funny howforgetful some people are he resumedafter awhile Why The old manstopped suddenly and stared at his sonin amazementWhat is it father the son askedwith anxietyI declare he exclaimed Talkingabout forgetfulness made me remember Why George I forgot to thankyou for my present Here Ive been using it every day and havent said aword to you about at Of course whenLetty went away he continued whilethe look of perplexity on the sons facedeepened I didnt know what youdsend me but I knew it would be something niceI said to Lett3 Letty what do youthink George will send me Shecouldnt guess and neither could I butI said I hoped it would be a Bible withnice large print and when she gothome this is what she brought meWhy where is it he exclaimed withconcern I always keep it right hereLetty must have put it away and hestarted in quest of the missing bookBut father I dont understandWhat is this about mv giving vou aBibleThe old man stopped for a momentgazed at his son with a quizzical lookand laughed loud and long Youthought Letty wouldnt tell who sent itdidnt you Oh you like secrets aswell as your father Still chucklinghe went into the houseOne look at her uncles face as he hurried into the kitchen and Letty knewthat he had found out1 know Im wicked to deceive himso she stammered while the tears began to gather but Uncle George Icouldnt help it He wanted the Bibleso much arid counted on your sendinghim one I had to get it I couldntdisappoint himWhy didnt you tell me he askt dseverely I didnt know he wantedoneBut he did not wait for an answerHe suddenly remembered how little hehad seen of Letty while she was on hervisit He had been busy on an important case and had hardly noticed herHe recollected with a pang of remorsethat he had scarcely even asked afterhis father much less thought of a giftfor him until he had received the letterasking him- to come back to the oldfarm for a few days His wife and children were at the seacoast business wasdull and he had come come emptyhandedAnother Bible asked Mr Sawyerin surprise as he came in a week afterGeorges departureYes George took that one back Iguess he hadnt examined it very closely before and he said the binding waspoor just as you thought and he sentme this He displayed a beautifulBible in an adjustable holder Itsreal comfortable and handy he continued and ieorge wrote mj name init himself He showed the strongbusinesslike writing with a pardonableprideI told him Id rather have his writing if it wasnt quite so fancy thoughhe is going to write once a

as long as thebuilding in which they are to be placedHang the frame a at one side to thewall by heavy strap or T hinges andsupport the other ide by props dplaced under it or a couple of piecesof stout

of the angleworm is to scatter a quantity of stronglime all over the poultry runs or yardsearly every spring and ycu will neverhave any more gapes in your flockI have done this for the past five yearsand have never had any chicks infectedwith this malady since I began theuse of limeLime is also a good disinfectant anddestroys other disease eerms and vermin The lime is also beneficial to

in a place convenient to the3Tard so the cattle and hogs can beturned in on it Then there should beanother piece to turn into when this iseaten down This may seem like aslovenly way of doing but it should beremembered the husking of the corn isthe most expensive part of growing thecrop It costs from three to five centsper bushel to husk and put it in thecrib and then it has to be shoveled outagain Of course part of the corn willhave to be husked to be fed later on in agood yard for here is where a great partof the profit com s in Some may thinkit costs too much to build fences to keepstock in the corn fields but a good fencewill last at least 15 years The stock canbe turned in the field just as soon as thecorn begins to glaze Stock fed in thisway will train ast r than when fed drycorn but care should be taken not toleave them in the field too long at firstThev should not be turned into a fieldj of green corn in a poor condition or theresult might be damaging and the profits from feeding in this way lost Whenthe corn is in proper condition to cut apart of the crop should be cot eitherwith a machine or by hand and shockednicely in the field to be fed la7er without husking this saves labor also andmakes a nice lot of feed to be fed out inthe winter There is also a good profitin feeding sheep in the same way thatis turn them in the corn field in the falland cut up corn and feed them throughthe winter I wintered 100 sheep in thatway last winter and I never had sheepdo so well before In order to get theiuost profit out of corn it is necessary tosave as much labor as possible Thereare many ways of feeding corn at aprofit this timr of year Pastures aregetting short fur the dairy cow and if alittle corn that was planted for thatpurpose is cut and fed to the cows
