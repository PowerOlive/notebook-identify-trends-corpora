How to Detect the
Alum Baking Powder
"Which are the. alum baking powders; '
how can I avoid diem unless they are named?'
asks a housekeeper.
Here is one way: take the can of a low
priced powder in your hand and read the
. ingredient clause upon the back label. The
law requires that if the powder contains alum
.that fact must be there stated. ' If you find
one of the ingredients named alum, or sul
j phate, of aluminum, you have found an alum
baking pctodcr.
There is another and a better way. You
don't have to know the names of the alum
powders. Use Royal Baking Powder only;
that .assures you a cream M- tartar powder,
and the purest and most healthful baking
powder beyond question. 4
