STIVERS.
Sherman H. Stivers, aged about
sixty, for many years one of the best
known men in Central Kentucky,
died at seven o'plock, yesterday
morning, at 336 Harrison avenue, in
Lexington, where he had been con
fined to his bed for several weeks
with the illness that finally resulted
in his death. Mr. Stivers had been
ill for some time with a complication
of diseases, but manfully stuck to
his work until the disease had made
such inroads on his system as to com
pel cessation of activity.
Mr. Stivers was a native or tnis
county, having been born on the old
place on the Beftilehem pike, where
his parents, Mr. and Mrs. J. W. Sti
vers, resided until their death. He
received his early education in the
schools of his day, and was quick to
take advantage of every opportunity
to improve his mind. He was en
gaged in various enterprises about
Paris, but finally went into the news
paper business, being for, a time asso
ciated with THE NEWS, when the
paper was published on Broadway.
He was given the post of Paris cor
respondent of The Lexington Herald,
his work gaining him the approba
tion of The Herald.. -
Several years ago he was made ed
itor of the Blue Grass Farmer edi
tion of The Herald, in which he ren
dered faithful and conscientiouser
vice. He was endowed with, a keen
memory, a ready, pen and had a re-
mailable adaptitude for newspaper
work. -Leaving the employ of The
Herald he was for several years en
gaged as publicity manager for the
manufacturers of Tanlac. Leaving
this line of work he returned to
Paris, where he again took up news
paper work, being given his former
position as Herald representative and
local business manager. This he re
tained until forced to give it up by
illness. Mr. Stivers was a man who
was well-liked by all who knew him,
and his hundreds of friends here and
elsewhere heard with genuine sorrow
the hews of his death. Mr. Stivers
was a member of Rathbone Lodge.
Knights of Pythias, of Paris, and of
the Paris Presbyterian church..
Besides his widow, who resides in
Lexington, Mr. Stivers is 'survived by
three children, one son, Harry bti
vers, of Chattanooga, Tenn., Miss
Ruby Stivers, of Lexington, and Mb.
Mattie Andrews, of California; also
by three brothers and three sisters,
James Stivers, Rufus Stivers and J.
Hooker Stivers, of Paris, Mrs. John
M. Woods, of Winchester, Mrs. L. B.
