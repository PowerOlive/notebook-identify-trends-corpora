- LEER
Charles Carroll Leer, aged
eighty-seven, one of the best-known
farmers in Bourbon county, died at
his home, on the Maysville pike,
near Paris, Saturday night, at eight
o'clock, after a lingering illness.
Mr. Leer was a son of the late
David and Cordelia Fleming Leer,
pioneer citizens of Bourbon coiyity.
He was born within a mile of the
site of the residence in which he
died and where he had lived for
over fifty years. Mr. Leer was an
authority on matters connected with
the history of Paris and Bourbon
county, and was one of the best-posted
men on general affairs that the
county contained. He was noted for
having a most remarkable memory,
and was often consulted by parties'
making notes on the history of the
city and county. He was a man of
education and talent, and well in
formed m all that pertained ta
county, State and National events.
Mr. Leer is survived by his widow,
Mrs. Adelia Ewing Leer, and one
daughter, Miss Carroll Leer, and one
son, Courtland Leer, both of whonw
reside at home.
The funeral was held at ten
o'clock yesterday morning, with ser
vices conducted at thegrave in the
Paris5 Cemetery, by Rev. T. S. Smy
lie, pastor of the Paris Presbyterian
church.
A most unsual circumstance was
witnessed at the funeral, the pall
bearers, fourteen in number, were
all nephews, grand-nephews anfi first
cousins of Mr. Leer, who had ex
pressed a wish that his remains
might be carried by them to the last
resting place in "the city of the
dead."

ways in closest and most frequent

the first to see a sign of weakness
in the opposite trenches and to take
advantage of it. In a charge he
constitutes the front rank.
Whether his paper be a daily or

ways share a just reward, but he

Every Democrat owes a duty to his
party, and that duty is only partly
performed when he or she votes the
Democratic ticket. There are long
periods between elections when
many Democrats give little or no
thought to the men in the" first
trenches. Unless these are support
ed and loyally supported, chances of
victory are minimized. Support of
the organization and by organiza
tion we mean National, State, coun
ty and precinct and support of the
Democratic press is not only the
duty of all Democrats, but it is a
duty that practically every Demo
crat can perform without hardship.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
are wasted in campaigns by candi
dates and party committees because
they do not know how to spend it
to the best' advantage. If Demo
cratic candidates and committees
would t consult with the local Demo
cratic editors, these sums could be
expended in the most legitimate and
effective way. With proper co-operation
between candidates, commit
tees and local editors the maximum
results only can be obtained. There
is nc danger that the Democratic
press will be or can be Newberryiz
ed, because such methods are re
pugnant to Democratic organizations
and candidates, and the Democratic
press itself is intellectually and
otherwise honest.
