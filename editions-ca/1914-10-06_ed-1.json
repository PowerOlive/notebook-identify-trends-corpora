prohibition to apply to druggists also,
was illegal, invalid, and null and void,
for the following reasons, to-wit:

cent, of the votes cast therein, at the
last preceding general election
2. Because said petition was not
signed by a number of legal voters
equal to twenty-five per cent, of the
votes cast in Bourbon County at the
last preceding general election.
3. Because the Judge of the Bour
bon County Court, after the filing of
the petition and before entering an
order of election thereon did not
hear proof that said petition was
signed by a number of legal voters
equal to twenty-five per cent, of the
votes cast in Bourbon County at the
last perceding' general 'election.
4. Because said petitioners whose
names were signed to said petition
did not offer any proof that said peti
tion was signed by a number of legal
voters in said County equal to twenty
five per cent, of the votes cast therein
at the last preceding general elec
tion. 5. Because the Judge of the Bour
bon County Court, at the next regu
lar term thereof, after receiving said
petition, did not make an order on his
order book, directing an election to be
held in said county on some date
named in said petition,. no earlier than
sixty days after said application was
lodged with the Judge of said Court,
directing the Sheriff, or any other
officer of said County, appointed to

each and all voting places in said
County, on said .date, for the purpose
of taking the sense of the legal voters
of said County, who were qualified

or not spirituous, vinous or malt

ed therein, or whether or not any
prohibition law in force in said
County, or in any city, town, precinct
i or district thereof, by virtue of any
general or special act or acts shall
I become inoperative.
6. Because the order which was
spread upon the order book of the
County Court, purporting to call said
election on September 28th, 1914, was
not signed by the Judge of the Bour
bon County Court and is therefore
null an. void, and of no effect.
7. Because in said' purported order
of election, the County Judge of- Bour
bon County did .not, at the same time,
fix a date for the registration for
those people entitled to vote thereat,
whose names had not been recorde.

and did not require same to be pub

place of said election of vote are re
quired to be published.
8. Because upon a petition filed
byT. F. Brannon and others, which
petition contained a number of legal
voters in each precinct of the City of
Paris, equal to twenty-five per cent,
of the votes cast therein at the last
preceding general election, the" Judge
of the Bourbon County Court had or
dered an election to be held in each
precinct of the City of Paris on Sep
tember 26th, 1914, to take the sense
of the legal voters of each of said
precincts of the City of Paris upon
the question whether or not spirit

titled to vote thereat whose names
had not been recorded on the regis
tration books of that year; and be
cause the said Judge of the Bourbon
County Court in -the order for a
special registration day for the elec
tion, which was held on Sep
tember 28th, 1914, did not fix a
special registration day for that elec
tion. 9. Because the County Board of
Election Commissioners in appoint
ing the election officers to conduct
said registration and said election did
not divide said officers equally as
required by law, between those favor
ing .said proposition and those op
posing said proposition.
10. Because at the special regis
tration which was held in the City
of Paris on September 18th 1914,
legal voters in said City of Paris,
who were entitled to register
on said date, and who were entitled
to vote at said election, and who ap
plied for permission to register in
the precinct in which they were legal
ly entitled to register and vote, were
not permitted to register and thereby
were prevented from voting.
11. Because the Bourbon County
Board of Election Commissioners in
the appointment of officers to hold
sai. registration and said election on
September 28, 1914, on September 18,
wrongfully and "unlawfully and with
purpose and intent to favor those op
posed to said proposition, appointed
clerks of registration and election
from the list of names furnished by
those opposed to said proposition in
five out of the six precincts in the
City ot Paris, and thereby wrongfully
and unlawfully, and unjustly gave to
those opposed to said proposition,
control of registration in said five
precincts out of six in the City of
Paris; and because of these facts
heretofore set out, said election was
not free and equal.
12. Because in Clintonville Pre
cinct No. 2, in Bourbon County, and
in North Middletown Precinct No. 2,
in Bourbon County, and in Millers
burg Precinct No. 1, and in various
other precincts in Bourbon County in
which the officers of election taken
from the list of names furnished by
those favoring said proposition did not
appear at the polls at six o'clock on
the morning of the election, to-wit,
on September 28th, 1914, the other
officers and the voters present op
posed to said proposition wrongfully
and unlawfully, refused and failed to
wait thirty minutes as required by
law, for the appearance of the regu
larly appointed officers, and wrong
fully and unlawfully selected other
officers from bystanders present to
take the place of such officers that
were regularly appointed; and wrong
fully and unlawfully Selected other
officers from among" the bystanders
who favored said proposition.
13. Because the Sheriff of Bour
bon County did not advertise in a
weekly and daily paper published in
the County, said notice of election
for at least two weeks before said
election and in fact failed to adver
tise said election for two weeks by
posting a written or printed hand bill
at some conspicuous place in each
precinct of said County as required
by law; and because said' Sheriff
only advertised said election in the
Bourbon News in the issue beginning
August 14th, and ending with the
issue of August 21st, said newspaper
being published in Bourbon County,

Bourbon County, Kentucky, by
license, and are autorized to conduct
said business in said territory by vir
tue of license granted to each of them
by the United States of America,
Commonwealth of Kentucky and the
City of Paris; and that the license of
them and each of them were on Sep
tember 28th, 1914, and now are in
full force and effect.
2. They come and amend the 18th
ground of contest heretofore filed, and,
for amendment thereto they say that
they are citizens and residents of the
United States of America and the
Commonwealth of Kentucky, of the
County of Bourbon, and of the City of
Paris; and they say that they are
engaged in the business of retailing
spirituous, vinous and malt liquors in
the City of Paris, Bourbon County,
Kentucky, under license duly grant
ed to them by the United States of
America, the State of Kentucky, and
the City of Paris, and that said
licenses were in fuif force and effect
on September 28th, 1914, and are still
'in full force and effect; and they-say
that said licenses will not expire until
after sixty days from the date of the
j entry of the certificate of the Can
vassing Board of Bourbon County in
the Order Book of the County Court,
unless the entry thereof is suspended.
They say that said Act is illegal
and unconstitutional and void, be
cause it deprives these contestants of
their property without due process of
law, and abridges the privileges
and immunities of these contest
ants as citidens of the United
States, and denies to these
contestants, who are persons within

City of Paris took advantage of the
Statutes in. such cases made and nro-
tne sense of the legal voters on said
proposition of whether spirituous.
vinous or malt liquors should be sold,
' bartered or loaned in said City, a ma
I jority of the legal votes cast was in
i favor of the sale of liquor within
'said City; and the contestants say
I that the said City of Paris, by rea
! son of the matters hereinbefore set
j out is and was a separate unit, and
j under the Statutes made and provid-
ed in such cases it is and was en
titled to vote separately from the
! County of Bourbon on the sale, bar
ter or loan of spirituous, vinous or
'malt liquors, and to determine for
i itself such question independently of
, said County; and that said City of
' Paris has so voted and has voted
and 'decided in favor of such sale;
and that by reason of the matters
herein et out, the election held in
the County of Bourbon on the 28th
day of Septsmber, 1914, is null, void
