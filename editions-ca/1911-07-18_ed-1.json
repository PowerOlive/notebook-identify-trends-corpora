won up to the final round the Bnur
bonites pulled off some quepr stunta in
the ninth and allowed the Pioneers to
carry off the day.
The locals out hit the visitors by
6ve points but a couple of errors in
the last framo put the Paris aggrega
tion high above the earth's level and
before they could anchor again on ter
ra firma three runs crossed the rubber
and the game was lost.
-After ihe first session when George
passed the first two, both of which
scored on Strieker's two bagger, he
pitched winning ball and but for the
grand blow up, which was started
when Walden's grounder bounded off
of McKernan's cranium and rolled so
far beyond the reach of the fielder .
that before it could be recovered the
runner had pulled up on third, he would
have won.
Creager was hit hard and every one
of the locals' runs were clearly earn
ed. However he worked himself out
of many tight places and only allowed
runs to come one at a time.
The visitors started off with a rush
in the first and counted twice. The
locals tied the score in the third and
fourth and went ahead in the eighth.
Three runs in the ninth nailed the
game as in the last half the locals
were unequal to the occasion of over
coming the lead.

The Way cf a Cat.
A husband and -wife of Presque Isle
started out last week to visit some
friends who live about three miles
from that town. On reaching their
destination they were greatly sur
prised to find their pet house cat
hidden under the seat among the
horse blankets. While greetings wero
being passed - the cat disappeared.
After a short visit and a hurried
search the visitors started for home.
More astonishment than before was
their share to find pussy awaiting
them, as demure as though nothing
had happened. Portland Press.
