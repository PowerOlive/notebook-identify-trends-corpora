A Weighty Question
The story is told of a gilded yonth of
Chicago whose father employed a pri
vate tutor to ram algebra into the
young mans head
In order to simplify tho plus and
minus the tutor used the familiar il
lustration of the counting of years from
the hirth of Christ
Now for instance we speak of so
many years A D or in tho year of our
Lord he said Those years counting
from the birth of Christ we may con
sider as the plus units The years count
ing back one by one before the birth of
Christ we may take to be the minus
units Now suppose I ask you the ques
tion How many years elapse between
tho date 10 B C and 10 A D
Let me get that straight said the
young man
The question was repeated He sat in
deep thought for several moments and
then said Well now Ill tell you I
could answer that if I only knew in
what year Christ was born Chicago
Record
Subdued the Virago
While Spurgeon was still a boy
preacher he was warned about a certain
virago and told that she intended to
give him a tongue lashing All right
he replied but thats a game at which
two can play Not long after as he
passed her gate one morning she assail
ed him with a flood of billingsgate
He smiled and said Yes thank
you I am quite well I hope you are
the same
Then came another hurst of vitupera
tion pitched in a still higher key to
which he replied still smiling Yes
it does look rather as if it is going to
rain I think I had better be getting
on
Bless the man she exclaimed
hes as deaf as a post Whats the use
of storming at him and so her rav
ings ceased and were never again at
tempted
The Boston of It
Yon would be pretty persisted
the other if you didnt know it your
self The gorgeous Boston creature
shook her head I can know nothing
she argued I have mental impres
sions but they do not establish exter
nal fact Externality is a figment of
subjectivity Ergo I do not know I am
pretty quod erat demonstrandum
Casuistical subtleties doubtless but not
easily to be swept away for all that
