PRINTERS PRANKS
Watson Wilson printers and publish
ers were very much in need of a man
There was the new tax list just awarded
them by tho county commissioners they
had helped to elect and thoy did not know
a thing about tho insanity breeding prob
lem of rule and figure work Thoy had
learned the trade like many anothor man
in the and could
country set straight com
position with anybody
Watson indeed had doveloped a talent
for display lines and could satisfy all the
demands of Watertown merchants for en
velopes and letterheads and by following
tho general form of ancient wall borne
specimens could do sales bills to your
hearts delight
But who should save them from the pit
falls of rules and figures
As they stood at the bottom of the stair
way thinking of these things they saw a
stranger on tho street Watortown always
looked twice at a stranger It was just
unhurried enough to spare the time
This man was of medium hoight slen
der with tho appearanoo of ono who has
flourished in cities catching tho style and
tho garments that are unusual in the coun
try His bands were slender and there
was a something about the right thumb
and forefinger which proclaimed his craft
at once
Hes a printor said Watson
Hes seen the sign and is coming
over said Wilson
The new man paused at the entrance
way read tho oardboard office signs on
the stairway looked at the two men crit
ically and inquired
Any chance for work
How did you know we wore the pub
lishers asked Watson
How did you know I was a printer
asked the man
In the afternoon ho took charge of the
delinquent list and in half an hour they
knew they were secure Ho was a crafts
man He knew everything from bending
rule to casting rollers
But he would not pull the hand press
and he would not work Saturday after
noon Tbey labored with him on those
points but he laughed and said he was
past it
He was given to jesting and ono of his
happiest thoughts was to shoot a spray of
water into the oyoof an inquisitive citizen
who wanted to see purple stars in a galloy
of dead type wetted for distribution
He changed tho figures in the advertise
ment of lands delinquent after the first is
sue and wondered if tho money londers
who should later purchase could make
good title with defective publication
In a good many ways he enjoyed him
self It was clear to every one that he held
the town and all its belongings in some
thing like contempt but ho was ho amia
ble about it so suave in his treatment of
people that punishment was unthought
of and antipathy was disarmed
When Watson Wilson began advertis
ing for the Fourth of July celebration the
printer was ready to move He had work
ed three months in one town and was
hungry for the city
They wanod him to stay Thoy sat
down ono day in June when the paper
was off and tried to argue it He told
them he must make a confession
There was a young woman in tho town
sweetheart affianced he feared of a man
whom he regarded as his friend and she
had smiled upon him She was very fair
and he feared he might forget himself
prove disloyal and court a girl to his
friends undoing
They applauded the chivalric spntiraent
uiu nciiu ar nj nauauu uoauiau iU TVUB
Wilsons young lady Wilson convinced It
was Watsons girl
Tho Fourth of July had come Wilson
was master of ceremonies Watson was
leader of the band People came in dele
gations from the country There was a
cannon on the bluff and a float on the
rive
Wilson wanted something with which to
load that 20 pounder Cramming down
wet paper was good in its way but it
didnt make noise enough The printer
suggested old roller composition There
were loads of it In the big box on the land
ing It was tho one indestructible thing
on earth
Ram down that roller composition
said the printer and they will hear your
old cannon in 14 counties every time she
speaks
Wilson did as directed Watson came by
with the band Wilson pulled a very long
rod of iron from a fire ran across the open
space and whipped his redhot torch upon
the powder sprinklod touchhole of the 20
pounder
The powder flamed into a geyser of fire
There were a flash a pause and then a
shook which stopped the current of the
river The roller composition had clung
to the guns interior refusing ejectment
and the cannon was shattered in a hun
dred pieces
The noise was terrible Tho concussion
shook Watson from his feet and hurled
half of the band in a pile above him It
lifted the ambitious Wilson and set him
down in the leading wagon of a passing
delegation How the crowd escaped un
harmed was a marvel no man could solve
The forward four feet of the cannon
leaped 50 yards and sood up like a post
the yielding but tenacious ancient compo
sition bubbling like a blossom from the
ragged iron
Watson excused himself while the crowd
was making inquiries and started uptown
for the printer
Wilson olimbed out of the country mans
wagon and joined his partner in the search
A messenger boy from the telegraph of
fice met them At the bottom of the stairs
with the regulation yellow envelope
Watson opened it and Wilson read over
his shoulder The date was in a country
seat 20 miles away
I heard your cannon
And that was the last they ever heard
of the printer Leroy Armstrong in In
land Printer
A Playground on a Roof
The boys of St Pauls cathedral choir
have a cricket and football field out of
London where on the weekly half holiday
they play among themselves and with oth
er schools and choir schools For the rest
of the week they possess1 what is certainly
the strangest playground in England
The top of the roof of the school is inclosed
by means of strong beams and wlro net
ting so that balls cannot fall on the un
suspecting passersby Here on the leads
hockey stump cricket and the like go
briskly forward in any of the odd mo
ments which thoy have to themselvei In
the winter a thin sheet of water which
quickly freezes converts tho roof into a
skating pond whereon the most anxious
parent could trust her son without fear of
his falling through -London Quiver
