TO SAISE $50,000 P0R DIXIE
HIGHWAY.
Dixie Highway promotors at a
meeting in Richmond have decided to
resume efforts to raise $50,000 by
subscriptions to complete the eastern
route in Laurel and Rockcastle coun
ties. Cincinnati has agreed to raise
$20,000, and each county in Ken
tucky and Ohio along the route is
assessed a certain portion. It will re
quire $100,000 to do the work and
both Laurel and Rockcastle have
reached the limit of their ability to
finance road building. Between
twenty and thirty miles remain to be
finished, with a bridge ever Parker's
Creek. The counties after two years'
controversy have agreed upon th3
route to the point where their re
spective roads join.

I DANIEL BOONE'S SWING.
Do you remember reading in one
of the school histories about how
the doughty Daniel Boone, when pur
sued by Indians on his way to the
unknown wilderness of Kentucky, cut
a grapevine near the ground so that
it formed a swing upon which he
traveled through the air for enough
to break his track?
If you read it, you probably thought
it a bit fishy, unless you live some
where in the Allegheney Mountains;
you would not believe that wild
grapevines are long enough or strong
enough to hold onto the trees tight
enough to make much of a swing.
As a matter of fact, there is no
reason to doubt that Daniel made the
swing and got away from the Indi
ans. For in the mountains of West
ern Maryland and Eastern West Vir
ginia, across which Daniel took his
hazardous way, the boys are still
making such. swings just for fun.
And royal fun it is. The writer of '
this was driving through the moun
tains near the upper Potomac a few
weeks ago when he saw some enor
mous grapevines drooping sixty or
seventy feet from the tops of the
rtrees. Swings made with ropes were
-tame by comparison. But there was
no temptation to emulate Daniel by
"letting loose at the end of the swing.
It took pioneering nerve to do that.

AUTOS AND AIRPLANES.
Our aircraft program is largely
dependent on the speed with which
our automobile factories can turn to
making airplane engines. European
experience has shown that the air
plane engine is quite different from
the auto engine, not only in detail,
but in principle. The essentials of a
successful automobile engine are low
cost, silence and long lite. None of
these factors is vital to a successful
airplane engine. Here the essentials
are light weight and absolute relia
bility. An airplane engine does al
most all its work at full speed; it
does not have to be as "elastic" as
an auto engine. Expense is no ob
ject, and it may be as noisy as it
cares to be, so long as it delivers the
power. Engineers point out that the
airplane engine is quite, distinct from
the commercial or pleasure car en
gine, but is much like the racing car
engine in essential characteristic.

NEW SOURCES OF PAPER,
The paper shortage has stimulated
the inventive genius of the whole
world into a search for new forms
of raw materials. Discoveries along
this line are announced almost daily
because the essential constituent of
paper, the cellulose. fiber, is common
to almost the whole vegetable king
dom. The problem is wholly one of
cheapness and -practicability of pro
duction. Among the promising sug
gestions are the proposal to use spin
ach stalks, put forward by a French
scientist, who has proved his success
experimentally, and the proposed use
of the Mexican sacaton grass. A very
promising related development is the
reported perfection of a process by
which the printer's ink can be re
moved from old newspapers.
SIMPLE BRAKE.
(Popular Mechanics Magazine.)
A new devicje for preventing back
lashing in casting, now incorporated
in certain fishing reels, consists of a
bar to which is attached a wire bail
that serves as a brake lever. When
ever the fishline is taut it draws
the bail up into such a position that
it releases the reel brakes, but when
the line slackens, as when the bait
strikes the water, the bail drops
doVn, setting the brakes so that the
reel's speed is lessened and no back
lash occurs.

"SAMMIES" TO PARADE THROUGH
LONDON STREETS.
In response to suggestions made by
London newspapers, the War Office
and the commander of American
troops in England are considering
parading the troops through the
streets of London to give the people
a chance to welcome them. The ar-'
rangements may be completed within
a few days, when an announcement
is expected from the War Office. The
announcement by one of the newspa
pers that arrangements for the pa
rade had already been made was de
clared premature.
All the London newspapers assert
that the people are awaiting a chance
to welcome the Americans.
