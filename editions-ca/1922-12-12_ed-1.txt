PARIS, KENTUCKYTUESDAY, DEGOfBlR 12riS22PAGE FOURMLLY TELLEE MEMORIAL AUNIQUE GIFT, One of the most unique memorialsin the annals of a religious body isthat which Mr. and Mrs. Carrol A.Teller, of Louisville, the latter adaughter of Mr. and Mrs. I. L.;Pricef of Paris, left to the congregation of the Temple Ada,th Israel,in Louisville, before their departurefor Chicago to reside. The December issue of the Monthly Bulletin,published under ' auspices of theTemple Adath congregation, says:"The congregation is deeply grateful to Mr. and Mrs. Carrol A. Telliar for a unique bequest offered toour Religious School before theyleft the city. The circumstancessurrounding the offer are so unusual that they deserve special mention. ' "On May 9th of this year Mr.and Mrs. Teller lost their littleson, Billy, a sweet and lovable boy,under circumstances of a peculiarand sad nature. The heart of thecongregation went out in sympathy-to the bereaved parents, and so faras it was humanely possible ourpeople helped them bear their burden of bereavement and become'reconciled to the loss. Mr. andMrs. Teller were appreciative of"this and decided to show theirgartitude in a way that would notonly be a memorial to their ' departed little son, but at the sametime render a lasting religious service to the congregation."With this in view they haveoffered to give to the congregationthe sum of $100 a year during theirlifetime, and have provided a sinking fund which will take care ofthis donation in the future, and themoney to be used exclusively for thegood of our Religious School. Infairness to Mr. and Mrs. Teller itmay be said that they made thegift free of any condition. It was;our suggestion that a 'Sunday Schoolroom be named 'The Billy TellerMemorial Room' in recognition ofthis unique gift. We thought thiswas proper."Wp hs.ve eriven these detailsj about the Billy Teljer Memorial because it s not omy tne uil gut uiits kind to our congregation, but.insofar as we have been able to getinformation from the Departmentof Synagogue and School Extensionof Cincinnati, there is no other giftlike it anywhere. Be this as it mayit marks a new type of giving.Hospitals, orphanages and charities have been recipients from timeof old, while our religious and educational institutions have been veritable Cinderella. There is anawakening in this new field of giving in our congregation and we regard it as a distinction that AdathIsrael should be in the lead. TheTeller Memorial is a pointer in Religious School endowments."oSTYLISH SHOES GREATLY REDUCED IN PRICES'T-TfjFhlBrsK .m .mM m m- m x nDepartment StoreParis, Kentucky.CHRISTMASSALEBIG DROP IN PRICESRELIGIOUS. iA Resume of Events In ReligionsCircles For iTesent andFutureA beautifully selected line ofstylish shoes and slippers for ladies,men and children, especially boughtfor the holiday trde.

Davis,Secretary of the United States Department of Labor, Guy A. Henry,General Director of the Eye ' SightConservation Council, is directingthe campaign, which aims to accomplish vast savings in health andmoney by carrying the . message"First Health, Then Wisdom." toevery city and hamlet in the landwhere children are taught.Every school in Kentucky will beasked to join in establishing thenew semi-annual custom of EyeSight Conservation Day, planned asa universal! and permanent contribution to the American system ofeducation.The Eye Sight ConservationCouncil is enlisting the assistanceof commissioners of education inevery State, and of superintendentsin every county and school district.Kentucky school officials have beenprovided with a complete Eyesignt conservation Day program.To execute this plan George W.

Richmond Times-Dispatch.It is not always the good luck ofajn author to fall into kindly andskillful hands when his book isdramatized. Harry Leon Wilson hasmuch to be thankful for that his"Merton of the Movies" was turnedinto a, play by such skillful craftsmen and clever wits and George S.Kaufman and Marc Connelley. In"Merton." the power for blendinghumor., satire, and pathos which isdistinctly Wilson's, is happily preserved, while the Kaufman-Con-nelleytwins add their ability toconstruct a well-knit play, andtheir own individual kind of brightness. The play abounds in pitfajlsfor the unwary dramatists.
