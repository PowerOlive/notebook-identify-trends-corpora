This was anofficial announcement made Tuesdaynight by the Executive Committee ofthe Burley Union after an executivesession behind closed dors which lasted nearly the entire afternoon. Theaction practically repudiates the action of the red hot meeting of growersheld in Lexington on February 20,which declared for a cut out with orwithout the Burley Society.The committee puts it squarely upto the Burley Society to determinewhether or not there shall be a cutout. Some of the cut out enthusiastsexpress the hope that the districtboard of the society, at its quarterlymeeting in Lexington next Tuesday,will declare for a cut out, but reportsfrom the country are that farmers arealready making plans to raise the customary crop and it is probable therewill be no restraint placed on the production of Burley toabecu ihis year.The official statement of the committee is as follows:"To the tobacco growers nf theWhite Burley district: Owing to theconfusion in the minds of many growers of tobacco as to the 1911 cut out,the Executie Committee of the Burley Tobacco Union deems it wise tomake the following statement:"The Burley Tobacco Union, in convention qn January 6, in the effort tocut out the 1911 crop, adopted the following pledge:" 'I agree not to grow any tobacco,personally, by tenant or agent, nor topermit any tobacco to be xrown onany land which I own or control during the year 1911. This agreementshall not'be binding unless in the judgment of the executive boards of theBurley Tobacco Union and the BurleyTohacco Society a sufficient per cent ispledged to insure a successful cut outof the 1911 crop, and unless said cutout is officially declared by the executive loards of both the Burley Tobacco Union and the Burley TobaccoSociety before the 20th day of February, 1111."On February G the Burley TobaccoUnion reconvened to hear reports fromthe various counties as to the successof the work in securing signatures tothe cut out pledges, and it appearingto the Burley Tobacco Union that asufficient acreage had been signed towarrant a successful cut out, providedit was joined by the Burley TohaccoSociety, the following resolution wasunanimously adopted by the convention of the Burley Tobacco Union :" 'Resolved, by the Burley TobaccoUnion, in convention assembled, Thatit is the sense of this meeting that acut out be declared;- that the BurleyTobacco Society's executive committee be informed of the action of theBurley Tobacco Union, and that it theBurley Tobacco Society refuses to indorse the movement it be abandoned,and that the Executive Committee ofthe Burley Tobacco Union be instructed to notify the Burley Tobacco Society of this action.'"The Executive Committee of theBurley Tobacco Union presented thisresolution in person to tbe ExecutiveCommittee of the Burley TobaccoSociety on February 6 and receivedfrom them the following reply :" 'Lexington, Ky., Feb. 6, 1911.Committee of the Burley UnionGentlemen: At the present time,from your reports, we do not see ourway 'clear to recommend our people totake any action as to the 1911 cut out.Respectfully," 'EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, BUR-3 LEY TOBACCO SOCIETY.'"Subsequent to this refusal of theBurley Tobacco Society to indorse thecut out additional signatures were obtained in different counties and reported t) a meeting of growers held February 20. but no further action wastaken by the Burley Tobacco Society."This committee can now do nothing more than reaffirm that part ofthe resolution passed by the BurleyTobacco Uniun on February 6, whichdeclares that the movement would neabandoned unless indorsed by the Burley Tobacco Society."The Burley Tobacco Union haslabored hard and 'incessantly for thecut out and was led to believe that theBurley Tobacco Society would co-operatewith them, when the movementhad obtained sufficient strength towarrant a cut out, and it is a sourceof great regret that they failed to assist us in any way. Had we beenjoined by the Burley Tobacco Societywe believe a peaceful and successfulcut out woud have been accomplished,but the refusal of the Burley TobaccoSociety to co-operate with us renderedtbe pledges which had been signed nulland void and has so far made the cutout a failure."This committee decides to continuethetoganization of the Burley Tobacco Union in order to be ready at anytime to assist in any movement thatwill benefit the growres.

He was attending court in acountry town, and while waiting for'he trial of a case in which he vvab interested was urged by the attorneys ina dog case to help them. Voluminousevidence was introduced to show thatthe defendant had shot the dog in malice, while other evidence went to showthat the dug had attacked the defendant. Vest took no part in the trialand was not disposed to speak. Theattorneys, however, urged him tospeak. Being thus urged, he arosescanned the face of each juryman fora moment and said:"Gentlemen of the jurv. The bestfriend a man has in the world mayturn against him and become his enemy. His son or daughter that he hasreared with loving care may prove un-ay prove un-grateful. Those who are nearest anddearest tons, those whom we trustvith our happiness and our good namemay become tiaitors to their faith.The money that a man has he maylose. It flys away from him, perhapswhen he needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a momentof ill-considered action. The peoplewho are prone to fall on their knees todo us honor when suscess is with usmay be the first to thn w the stone ofmalice when failure settles its cloudupon our heads.1 "The one absolutely unselfish friendthat man can have in this selfishworld, the one that never deserts him,the one that never proves ungratefulor treacherous is hia dog. A man'sdog stands by him in prospeiity andpoverty, in health and in sickness.He will sleep on the cold ground wherethe wintry winds blow and the snowdrives fiercely, if only he may be nearhis master's side. He 'will kiss theVinrirl fhtif- hdu nr "nrr In ntfo- Vo tt?illiiVif tho tvmmHs r,r 0 thnf'nnmo'inencounter with the roughness :of theworld. He guards the sleep Sof hispauper master as it ne were a prince.When riches take wings and reputationfalls to pieces he is as constant in hislove as the sun in its journeys throughthe heavens. egMtz"If fortune drives the master forthan outcast in the world, friendless andhomeless, the faithful dog asks nohigher privilege than that- of accompanying him, to guard against danger,to fight against his enemies. Andwhen the, last scene of all comes, anddeath takes the master in its embrace,and his body is laid away in the coldground, no matter if all other friendspursue their way there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, hishead between his paws, his eyes sad,but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true, even in death." T.Z&MThen Vest S2t down. He had spokenin a low voice, without a gesture. Hemade no reference to thu evidence orthe merits of the case. When he finished Judge and jury werp wipingtheir eyes. The jury filed out. butsoon entered with a verdict of S500 forthe plaintiff whose dog was shot andit as said that some of the jurorswanted to hang thedefendant.

"Ther is a certain analogy in thacise of the great Caruso and tba heroine, Adelina. in "The Climax." whichJoseph Webber is sending to the ParisGrand next Wednesday night.The great tenor was losing his voiceand an operation was necessary. Fora time it was feared that music loversthroughout the world would neveragain hear his golden notes. Imaginethe anguish of the temperamentalItalian. If a man who has the worldof music at hi3 feet can suffer near tothe verge of collapse, what must awoman who is striving to be a primadonna, endure when she is told thatnever again can she sing another note.It is the human soul note, which hasbeen struck by the master hand of Edward Locke, that makes "The Climax"a play which appeals to all that isgood in us, and herein lies the secretof its lasting success. Last seasonMr. Weber sent out five companies tomeet the demand of the public to witness tne play this year the demandfor it is even greater, by reason of thecommendation which is limited to theconfines offthe North American continent.
