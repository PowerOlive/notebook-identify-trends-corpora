On Christmas day,1812, a stringent manifesto was issuedby the governmentjjabsolutelv prohibitingthe people from indulging in thehabit. This manifesto expressed thedesire for thesuppression of the evil inorder tojsave thepeople from a life ofdegradation, rnot by "tapering off,"but by stopping the habit entirely. Atthefsarne time the fear was voicedthat, although the government wasvery much in earnest, the peoplewould endeavor to evade the law.Indian opium to the value of $60,000,000 was stacked at that time inchests in Shanghai and Hongkongwarehouses; stacked there withoutfinaing buyers. After the manifestoby the government it was practicallyimpossibleSto buy or sell opium in thecoast provinces or the Yangste provinces.But lastlweek an incident occurredthat shows very grimly how earnest jthe new government is in this matter. !A woman of Shanghai, who openly persisted in the use of the drug, wastaken to a public place, by order ofthe governor of the province, and inthe presence of a large crowd of spectators was shot.To the occidental mind this willseem more than shocking; but perhapsthe oriental government knows besthow to handle its own problems. Andin the matter of stamping out theopium curse. China has a problem thatwould cause any nation trouble.One Million Dollar Auto Show.West 5 StreetWe Take Pleasure.in "oing up the finest shirtwaists or anything in thelaundry line.

The Herald says:"Pearce Paton, clerk of the GourbonCounty Court, has authorized the announcement of his candidacy for reelection to that office at the t primaryelection next August."Mr. Paton has made a very efficient clerk, and has won popularity byhis genial and accommodating manner.The County Clerk's office in this countyis one in which frequent changes havenot been popular."It will be of interest to Paris readers to know that from the beginning ofthe county in 1786 to the present .time,a period of 127 years, the county hashad only ten clerks."The first person to hold that officewas John Edwards, who was elected in1786. He was a man of considerableeminence and on the admission of Kentucky to the Union in 1792, he was thefirst Senator from Kentucky."Mr. Edwards was succeeded in 1792by Thomas Reeder, who held the officeuntil 1795, when Thomas Arnold waselected. Mr. Arnold was succeeded in1803 by William Garrard, Jr., who resicned on May 1, 1815. and was succeeded by Thomas Porter Smith. Mr.Smith was the father of the late Dr.Thomas P. Smish, of Paris, and thegrandfather of Hon. Jonn S. Smith,formerly County Attorney of Bourbon,afterwards Commonwealth's Attorneyof the district composed of Bourbon,Scott, Woodford and Franklin counties,and is now practicing law in Indianapolis. "Mr Smith held the office uninterruptedly from 1815 to 1851, a period ofthirty-six years In 1851, Mr. R. J.Brown was plected Clerk and held theoffice through the period of the CivilWar Mr. Brown was a Republican,and at the close of the war was defeased by the late James M. Hughes,a Mexican War veteran, well known toall the older iesidents of the county.Mr. Hughes had opposition severaltimes, but his popularity and the belief of the people that the CountyClerk's office was one that should notbe experimented with too freely,always enabled him to secure re-election.He was Clerk for twenty years.In August, 1886, William Mvall. ofParis, was elected to the office, his opponents for the nomination being W.S. Alexander, James Kerr, John S.Smith, K. K. McCarney and John W.Bouldn. Mr. Myall held the officefor two terms, from 1S86 to 1895, andhaving formed other business connections, did not ask for a third term.Ed. D. Paton, popularly known as'Bally' Paton, who had been Mr.Myall's deputy, succeeded to the officein 1895, having been elected the previous November. Mr. Paton held theo8jce until nis death on October 31,J 1908. when his son and deputy, Pearceraton, the preaent uierK, was appointed to fill cut the unexpired termand was tnen elected by the people apdafterwards re-elected."J.

BHSiADE IN PHILANTHROPIC MOOD'!Successful American Writer Relates,With Pleasure How He ServedInquiring Chicago Woman.George Ade was talking about-hislast visit to London."I like to knock about Londonalone," he said, "studying the placesof historical interest; and at this kindly Christmas season I remember withparticular pleasure a good deed that Iperformed at one of London's historiclandmarks for a Chicago woman."It was a rainy fall day and I satover a beefsteak pudding and a mugof bitter at the Cheshire Cheese onFleet street."The Chicago woman entered, Boswell's 'Johnson' in her hand. The Cheshire Cheese was, you know, Johnson'sfavorite tavern, and the woman hadbeen told that the great man's autograph could still be seen, penciled onone of the walls. ."The waiters told her they know ofno such autograph, but the woman,with dauntless Chicago spirit, begana long, long search, upstairs anddown."While she was upstairs a warmglow of benevolence suddenly rose upin my breast, and, taking a pencilfrom my pocket, I wrote with quainteighteenth century flourishes on thewall behind me:"'Sam: Johnson.'"The woman on her return from up,stairs spied the autograph and wasoverjoyed. Is it not amazing howmuch happiness we can give to othersby these little acts of kindness?"ROCKEFELLER A LITTLE SHYAccording to Small Girl His Apparently Strongest Asset Was NotEnough for One Thing.The audience which heard the Rev.W. W. Bustard, John D. Rockefeller'sCleveland pastor, address the Christian Endeavor convention was amusedby a story on the richest man."While riding in an auto with Mr.Rockefeller .recently, some miles fromCleveland," said the Rev. Dr. Bustard, "we were about to pass a littlebarefoot girl plodding along throughthe dust, when Mr. Rockefeller ordered the chauffeur to halt the car.Then he invited her to step up on therunning board and asked her whereshe would like to have the car stopped. "The little girl said she wanted toget off at the second crossroads, andasked:'"How far are you going?'"'Oh, we're going to heaven,' Mr.Rockefeller answered."The little girl was surprised, asmany people are when he says that.Then he asked:" 'Don't you think we'll get there?'"'No,' said the little girl."'And why not?' persisted Mr.Rockefeller.'"I don't think you have enoughgasoline,' she said." Cleveland Press.Rose-Tinted Mountains.The rosy light that tinges so beautifully the summits of lofty, snow-cladmountains before sunrise and aftersunset is due to the fact that theyellow and red rays of light possessmore penetrative power than the blue.The firstrmentioned rays make theirway through stretches of the atmosphere which entirely arrest and turnback the blue, and they do this themore especialy if the air is laden atthe time with extraneous particlesthat augment their opacity."When the sun is below the horizonthe red and yellow rays struggle onthrough the air as far as the snowyheights, dropping their associates bythe way, and thus paint their fleecysurfaces with red and yellow tintedlight. This roseate afterglow is verybeautifuly seen on the Jungfrau. Thebroad-based cone is suddenly coveredin the deepening twilight with .thecrimson hue of the rose, and thisgradually fades until the whole hasvanished into darkness. Harper'sWeekly.Too Tender With It.A physician tells a story of a philanthropic doctor in a Pennsylvaniacoal mining town who presented eachhousehold with a nice new thermometer and told the people the necessityof maintaining a proper temperature.When making his rounds one day heobserved his thermometer hanging inthe room. He inquired of the womanof the house if she had rememberedhis instructions."Indeed, sir, I do," was the response."I hang the thing right up there andI watch it carefully to see it does notget too high.'"God!" exclaimed the doctor. "Andwhat do you do when the temperature rises above 70 degrees V"Why, sir," answered the woman,with the air of one faithful to a trust,"when it gets too high I take it downand put it outside until it cools off."Newark Star.He'll Probably Give It Up.Will Prof. Walter Dill Scott orsome other eminent psychologist explain why a strong-minded, able-bodiedcitizen will lie awake in a stateof semi-freezing for hours, enduringthe slow torture, rather than get upin the full strength of the cold fortwo minutes while getting anotherblanket?Sins of the Mothers.Discovery that the hobble skirt wasin vogue just 5,000 years ago, promptsone to be belief that the sins of themothers shall be visited upon thechildren of the nine hundred andninety-ninth generation.

It is a hugefigure, bigger than most people canrealize. It will also mark a recordfor the number of shellfish broughtto life at the government place.At the present time there are at theBoothbay hatchery 13,529 seed lobsters from which eggs will be secured. The season for collecting the seeders extends into the spring of theyear, so that it is safe to say thatfully two-thirds as many lobsters ashave already been collected will beadded to the number on hand. Theaverage number of eggs secured fromthe mother lobster is 20,000. The percentage of fertility of these as theyare hatched at the government stationis so high that it i3 safe to say thatpractically all of them will be hatched. Reckoning on this basis, the number of seeders now at the hatcherywill produce 270,000,000 lobsters. Thenumber yet to be collected will verynearly total up to 500,000,000.AT THE AGE OF REAL WORTHYouth of Eighty Years of Age Hopesto Demonstrate His Value Beforethe World.Here is a young fellow who Is thereal thing.

At various timesthe scholars of different countrieshave tried definitely to determine thereal discoverer of paper in the eleventh century. It Is to paper that weowe the renaissance of letters. Fromtime Imemmorial something answering modern paper was used in China,where it was manufactured from silk.About the middle of the seventh century of our era there seems to havebeen established in Arabia a manufactory of paper, and fifty years later theway was discovered to make it fromcotton instead of from silk, silk beinga rare commodity outside of China atthe time, and cotton relatively plentiful. In the reign of Henry II. ofFrance a Greek scholar was sent toParis to arrange systematically a catalogue of antique manuscripts in theroyal library, and a notation in hishand speaks of what was then knownas "paper" as originating in Damascus. The later invention of makingpaper from flax, linen, hemp has beenattributed equally to Italy and Germany, but there is evidece that it existed prior to the fourteenth century.Harper's Weekly.Her Sculpture.A French woman who is wealthy,and noted as a generous entertainerof artistic folk, has herself some ambition to shine as an amateur sculptor. A Paris paper has told how thisclever woman managed to have apiece of work accepted by an art jury.One day she invited a master sculptor to dinner. After the dessert shesaid carelessly: "Come and see mylittle figure; it does not quite comeup to my idea."They passed into the atelier, wherethe sculptor gave a few reparatorytouches to the figure.Some dayB later she invited another sculptor to dinner. Again theatelier was visited. "Not bad, notat all bad," said this artist, and generously gave the figure a few usefultouches. After several seances ofthis kind the good lady was notashamed proudly to acknowledge thecomplete work as her own.Queen Elizabeth Opened It.In connection with Granville Barker's production of "Twelfth Night,"it is interesting to recall that we havestill standing in London one of thehalls in which the play was performedduring Shakespeare's lifetime. In thehall of the Middle Temple, opened byQueen Elizabeth in person in 1576,"Twelfth Night" was acted at Christmas, 1601, and there is a strong probability that Shakespeare himself played a part in that performance. Inthe early days the Inns of court werepatrons of the drama, and the hall ofGray's Inn can also claim to havewitnessed a contemporary Shakespeare production, "A Comedy of Errors" having been given there in 1594.London Chronicle.CANADIAN MONEY A MENACENew $10 Goldpiece and New PennyLook Much Alike, According to Banker.Similarity in appearance of the newDanadaian $10 gold piece and the Caoadian penny and the consequent danger of confusion of the two caused J.W. Spangler, vice-president of theSeattle National bank, to issue specificdirections to the men at the windowsto look out for the penny.The coins are nearly alike in appearance, excepting that the penny isa. trifle smaller than the gold piece.The obserse and reverse sides of bothcoins are similar, excepting that thelettering is respectively "ten dollars"and "one cent."The penny is of unusually light copper color, the bust of King George being shown in relief on both coins, andthe gold coin is the first ever turnedDut by a Canadian mint, paper currency having been the circulating medium above the value of 50 cents.Business men have been warned ofan attempted fraud on the part of menIn Canada who have triple plated 'thenew Canadian penny with gold andhave floated the coins in this countryas S10 gold pieces, relying on the hurry of business to successfully concealthe tell-tale lettering, and it is statedthat such coins have been passed inthe Pacific Northwest.WANTED TO KNOW THE PRICEMonte Carlo Visitor Had Learned Caution From the Size of His Billat the Hotel.Judge William H. Moore, at a horseshow supper in Gotham's-newest hotel, discussed hotel prices."They are worse at Monte Carlo,perhaps," he said, "than anywhereelse in the world. The German tourist is sneered at in Monte 'Carlo because when he enters a barber shopfor a shave he always asks what thecharge is to be before he sits down inthe chair."But what is a man to do in a barber shop where it is no uncommonthing to be charged two or three dollars for the simplest operation?"And It's the same thing in the hotels. I know a man who took a suiteat a Monte Carlo hotel without askingthe price of anything and in the restaurants of such hotels it's a commonthing to find no prices even on themenus."Well, when this man came to payhis bill it was enormous. But he paidit Then he said:" 'Have you any 25-centime stamps?'"'Yes, monsieur,' said the clerk.'How many do you wish?"My friend smiled blandly"'Tell me first, please,' he said,'what you charge for them here.' "Balkan Ballads.In the Balkan countries the balladmakers have certainly been at leastas important as the makers of laws.Servia's national ballads, commemoratir the glories of the Servian Emper : Dushan, the fatal battle of Kossovo rid the legendary exploits of thehero Marko Kralyevich and his horseSharats, are of Homeric proportions,and, sung to the accompaniment ofa guitar with cords of horse-hair tails,have kept national feeling warm forcenturies.

In Macedonia, Sir CharlesEliot heard a schoolboy recite a Bulgarian poem which took an hour anda quarter, with a simple but significant plot The Pasha of Sofia sunvmons a Bulgarian hero who is hisfriend and tells him he has orders toexecute him. The Bulgarian askswhy; the Pasha says he does notknow, but he must do it; and he does.Looking for Owner of Fingers.A' farmer near Kansas City, Mo.,is looking for the owner of a coupleof fingers he has in his possession.He went to market with a load ofpotatoes and started to sleep in hiswagon during the night before marketopened. He was disturbed by themoving of the canvas over the loadand, waking, saw a hand slip beneaththe canvas and abstract a couple ofthe tubers. The operation was repeated so many times that he couldforesee nothing but the disappearanceof the entire load unless he took summary action. Raising a sharp hatchethe had with him, the farmer smotethe hand the next time it appearedand the next morning found twoguilty fingers in the wagon. The remainder of his potatoes were notmolested.Twenty-Cent Shoes at Panama.The rope-soled slippers, with clothuppers, known as Spanish alpargatas,and worn by practically all the European and colored laborers in thecanal zone, are imported all the wayfrom Spain in such quantities thatthey can be retailed at the low priceof 20 cents a pair. The Europeanlaborer wears them 12 months in theyear on the isthmus, and over 1,000,000 pairs are sold annually by thecommissary. Alpargatas are durable,and have been adopted by isthmianbathers as the most convenient formof beach shoe.To Give Women a Broader Outlook.It is not expected that women willmake politics cleaner.
