" And so it was inthis instance. There was never adoubt from the beginning to the endof the day that the county wouldexceed its quota, and with all thecommittees and the various delegations putting forth their best effortsthe county went "over the top" to thesum of $800,000 or more. The quotaasked of the county was $675,400,and from the grand total given abovemay be inferred the extent of thework that was done all over thecounty last Saturday. From earlydawn until the shades of evening fell,batallions of automobiles invadedevery section of the county carryingthe committees solicting for the loan.In the outset the quota for thecounty had been placed at $675,400,and that was announced at a meetingheld at the court house, when thesum of $256,000 was raised in ashort while as a starter for the driveof Saturday. When the day ended ameeting was held at the court houseSaturday, when Chairman BucknerWoodford announced that the countyhad at that tijme reported a total of$775,000. Belated Teports receivedlater in the night made the total tclose to $S00,00O, which was verifiedby the committees yesterday. Thecounty now stands credited with thesum of $800,000 in the Fourth Liberty Loan.One of the inspiring features ofthe drive was the patriotic workdone in the city and county by theWomans' Loan Committee, under theleadership of Miss Kate Alexander.The members of the compiittee worked almost unceasingly Saturday, amdtheir headquarters at the cornerof Main and Broadway was a sceneof activity all through the day.Chairman Buckner Woodford was authority Sunday for the statement thatfully fifty per cent, of the amountraised in the county may be creditedto the hearty good work done by MissAlexander and her assistants.Bourbon county's record in thefour Liberty Loan campaigns in thepast since the United States enteredthe war, is a most enviable one. Inthe first drive the quota 'was placedat $300,000, and the sum of $381,700was turned in the treasury of thebanks. The quota for the seconddrive was placed at $321,550, and'the sum turned in by the "WDricers"101311160" T474.000.

He should be in Germanyfighting the Kaiser. Postoffice statistics are showing that it is not thewidows who have sons in France orpersons who have suffered illness orfinancial misfortunes who are cashingin their War Savings Stapnps, butmen who purchased War SavingsStamps merely for show or to gainpatriotic publicity. Such men thinkthey can secretly sneak around to thepostoffice, get the money which theyhave invested in stamps and use itfor some other purpose or pleasurewithout the public's knowing aboutit In reality such a person is worsethan an open enemy. He is willingto stab Uncle Sam in the back in thedark, while he supports him openly inthe light. It has been suggestedthat posoffices keep a record of allpersons cashing in their War SavingsCertificates, that the public mayknow who are and who are not trueAmerican citizens.te 153 ISA shell is measured by its diameter.

Aside from the sympatheticrelations which exist between Italyand America as faithful allies in thegreat struggle against the brutalTeuton dojmination, our people havea special interest in cultivatingfriendship with "The Crowned Republic," as Italy has been called.Our large Italian population can beimpressed by American ideas throughour generous appreciation of thegreat part their country is taking inthe war. We are fighting withItaly upon her soil, but we owe italso to Italy to give her at this critical moment, when German intrigueis still at work, both there and here,the valuable support of our admiration and good will.In view of this fact, the jointCommittee of the Italy America Society and of the Italian War ReliefFund of America are hoping that the12tti of October (Cplunibus Day) willbe made the occasion of a nationwide tribute to Italy,i We venture to suggest to - yourHonor tne immediate iormation ot arepresentative local committee ofleading citizens, to arrange a massmeeting and other ceremonies. Obviously, it would be well to invite theco-operation of Italian citizens.Respectfully yours,DOUGLAS L.
