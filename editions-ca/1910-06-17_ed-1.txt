desire to discuss or glossed them th m over as lf if ap apparently apparently Â¬parently of no importanceThe T e audience which heard h ard him numbered between six and eight ight Hun llundred nundred

om we recognized are directly directIr directIror or indirectly interested in the liquor busi business business Â¬ness nessThenessii The two main thoughts which ran through thro Jgh Mr Cantrills speech were wereV werettV itt the t denunciation denunciationof of the action of f the t e Burley B lrey Tobacco Society in opposing opjJOsinghhiijfelection h hi election and a a plea e to the t theDmocratic Democratic D cr t voters to support him because beca sOf1ThirDemocracy 4of because4of his Democracy r < tsr L L f d 1n n n nVeWe Ve agree thoroughly with Mr Cantrill that the Burley Burl

over Mr Kimball It was w s a mis mistaIe mistake Â¬take for it to do doso so It has no no business meddling m dd1ing in politics It It t had no nob nobusinessbusiness b sfness taking part in that

nominated for Congress had it not been for the support sup Â¬port he received from the members of the Burley Tobacco Association There Thereisis much greater reason for forfthe r rrace the Burley
