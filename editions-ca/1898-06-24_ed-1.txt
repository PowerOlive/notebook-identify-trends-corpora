clear a way forthe landing of troops The demonstration which he made with the Texasbefore Cabanas which is just east ofGuantanamo may easily have led theSpaniards to suppose that a generallanding was to be attempted in thatimmediate vicinity It was evident from the text of Adm Sanipsons dispatch that a considerablelanding had already been effected nearGuantanamo as he noted that communication by

the old man raised his headThough scarcely he noted her musingwordsHe tore the nest from the swaying treeHe flung to the wind its moss and hayAnd said When an empty nest you seeBe sure that you throw it far awayBut why she asked with a sorrowingfaceWhy may not the pretty home abideBecause he answered twill be a placeIn which the worm and the slug willhideLast year twas fair enough in its wayIt was full of love and merry with songBut days that are gone must not spoil todayNor dead joys do the living joy wrongThe maiden heard with a thoughtf ul faceHer first sweet hope had fled far awayAnd she

desire but for the eyes of the cockswain as they followed me derisivelyabout the deck and the odd smile thatappeared continually on his face Itwas a smile that had in it somethingboth of pain and weakness ahaggardold mans smile but there was besidesthat a grain of derision a shadow oftreachery in his expression as he craftily watched and watched and watchedme at my workCHAPTER XXVIISRAEL

disbelieved it The wholestory was a pretext He wanted me toleave the deck so much was plain butwith what purpose I could in no wayimagine His ejes never met minethey kept wandering to and fro up anddown now with a look to the sky nowwith a flitting glance upon the deadOBrien All the time he kept smilingand putting his tongue out in the mostguilty embarrassed manner so that achild could have told that he was benton -some deception I was prompt withmy answer however for I saw wheremy advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easilyconceal my suspicions to the endSome wine I said Far betterWill you have white or redWeH I reckon its about the blesserlsame to me shipmate he replied soits strong and plenty of it whats theodds - VAll right I answered Ill bringyou1 port Mr Hands But Ill have todig for itWith that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I couldslipped off my shoes ran quietly alongthe sparred gallery mounted the forecastle ladder and popped my head outof the fore companion I knew hewould not expect to see me there yet Ttook every precaution possible andcertainly the worst of my suspicionsproved too trueHe had risen from his position to hishands and knees and though his legobviously hurt him pretty sharplywhen he moved for I could hear himstifle a groan yet it was at a good rattling rate that he trailed himself acrossthe deck In half a minute he hadreached the port scuppers and pickedout of a coil of rope a long knife orrather a short dirk discolored to thehilt with blood He looked upon it fora moment thrusting forth his underjaw tried the point upon his hand andthejrhastily concealing it in thebosomof his jacket trundled back again intohis old place against the bulwarkThis was all that I required to knowIsrael could move about he was nowarmed and if he had been at so muchtrouble to get rid of me it was plainthat I was meant to be the victimWhat he would do afterward whetherlie would try to crawl right across theisland from North inlet to the campamong the swamps or whether hewould fire Long Tom trusting that hisown comrades might come first to helphim was of course more than I couldsayYet I felt sure that I could trust himin one point since in that our interestsjumped together and that was in thedisposition of theschooner We both dcsjredtphave her stranded safe enoughin a sheltered place and so that whenthe time came she could be got offagain with as little labor and danger asTmicrhtbe and until that Avas done Iconsidered that my life would certainlybe sparedWhile I was thus turning the businessover in my mind I had not been idlewith mv bodv I had stolen back to thecabin slipped once more into my shoesand laid my hand at random on a bottleof wine and now with this for an excuse I made my reappearance on thedeckHands lay as I had left him all fallentogether in a huddle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were tooweak to bear the light He looked uphowever at my coming knocked theneck off the bottle like a man who haddone the same thing often and took agood swig with his favorite toast ofheres luck Then he lay quiet for alittle and then pulling out a stick oftobacco begged me to cut him a quidCut me a junk o that says he forI havent no knife and hardly strengthenough so be as I had Ah Jim JimI reckon Ive missed stays Cut me aquid asll -likely be the last lad for Imfor

were askingme just now about the dead Youvebroken your trust youve lived in sinand lies and blood theres a man youkilled lying at your feet this momentand you ask me why For Gods mercyMr Hands thats whyI spoke with a little heat thinking ofthe bloody dirk he had hidden in hispocket and designed in his ill thoughtsto end me with He for his part took agreat draught of the wine and spokewith the most unusual solemnityFor 30 year he said Ive sailedthe seas and seen good and bad betterarid worse fair weather and foul provisions running out knives going andwhat not Well now I tell you I neverseen good come o goodness yet Himas strikes first is my fancy dead mendont bite thems my views amen sobe it And now you look here he added suddenly changing his tone wevehad about enough of this

am very sure that Hands was anexcellent pilot for we went about anddodged in shaving the banks -with acertainty and a neatness that were apleasure- to beholdScarcely had we passed the head before the land closed around us Theshores of North inlet were as thicklywooded as those of the southern anchorage but the space was longer andnarrower and more like what in truthit was the estuary of a river

isurgedWashington June 1 Senate The foreign relations committee through Mr Davisthe chairman Friday reported favorablytothe seiiate the Newlands resolution for the annexation of the Hawaiian Inlands Mr Davisannounced his purpose of railing up the resolutions Saturday for consideration but as thesenate decided later to adjourn until Mondaythe debate upon the resolutions will notbegin until that time The bill to incorporatethe International American bank in accordance with the recommendation of the FanAmerican congress which has occupied jlgreater part of the senates time this weekwas passed by a vote of 26 to 23 The design ofthe measure is to furnish such banking and exchange facilities as will promote trade betweenthe United States and the countries of Centraland South America The bill provides thatthe bank shall have a capital stock of 3000000and that the capital stock may be increased to525000000 The institution in accordancewith the terms of the bill shall be under thesupervision of the controller of the currency andin the character of the corporation which thebill grants certain privileges are accorded tothe incorporators in view of advantages whichare expected to accrue to

eulogies upon the late Senator Harris of TennesseeWashington June 21 Senate Discussion by the senate of the question of Hawaiianannexation was begun Monday in open sessionAt the very opening of the question the opponents of annexation quite unexpectedlyscored a point by preventing a yea and nayvote on taking up the resolutions The opponents of annexation were decidedly pleased atpreventing a show of strength but at 430Monday afternoon Mr White afforded thefriends of annexation the opportunity they hadbeen awaiting He moved to adjourn andlike a flash Mr Davis demanded theyeas and nays The motion the vote uponwhich was a test of strength between thefriends and opponents of annexation was defeated decisively 44 to 15 Having gained hispoint in developing the numerical weakness ofthe opposition Mr Davis readily agreed toenter a motion for an executive session Theproceedings of the day indicate clearly thatthere is to be no debate upon the Hawaiianquestion in the ordinary acceptation of thattermHouse The house Monday passed the general deficiency hill carrying 224000000 Thebill occasioned little debate and itpassed practically as reported to the house from the committee on appropriations The remainder ofthe day was given to District of Columbiabusiness At 537 oclock the house adjournedWashington June 22 Senate Interest inthe discussion of Hawaiian annexation whichis proceeding in the senate already has begunto flag- Early in the present session the senate debated the question behind closed doorsfor six weeks During that time a majority ofthe speakers were accorded close attention Itis evident from the proce3dings Tuesdaythat the senators will not become enthusiastic over arguments which arenot now new to them TuesdayMr White dem Cal the leader of the opponents of annexation spoke for three hoursand a half His argument was skillful andwas presented with oratorical ability but itfailed to command the attention from senatorsit really deserved Among the bills passed wasone providing severe penalties for the malicious injury or destruction of submarine minerstorpedoes fortificattons or other coast defensesHouse After passing several bills of minorimportance Tuesday the house in committeeof the whole considered without disposing of ubill to refer to the court of claims certainclaims of persons for property taken or destroyed by

annexation of Hawaii again occupiedthe attention of the senate Wednesday MrWhite dem Cal resumed his speech begunTuesday but after speaking two hours yieldedthe floor to Mr Pettigrew S D who discussed the resolutions for an hour and a halfMr White has not concluded his speechMr Pettigrew taking up the argument againsfcthe resolutions merely to afford him anopportunity to rest The conference report on-the Indian appropriation bill was presented tothe senate and read but no effort was made todispose of it It was sharply criticised how-ever and the indications are that its adoptionwill be contested because of the elimination orthe senate free homestead amendment and theacknowledgment of the right in certain circumstances and conditions of Indians to leasemineral landsHouse A bill

My brainwas on fire with excitement I walkedup slender path fiomvJidreI had an excellent look oit over thecountry a fine timbered section nearLexingtonMy eyes were strained out of theirsockets almost and my ears must havestood away from my heads so eager wasI to catch the slightest sound Theleaves rustled in the wind and now andthen a branch crackled under theweight of a clumbering bird I imagined ail sorts of things The war wa3young then and we wern seasonedand hardened in experience A fellowsimagination gets very vivid and he isliable to see all sorts of things that he isexpected to see and watch out for Lossof sleep uniusual excitement and afeverish anxiety not to be caught napping made me all the more fearful ofbeing trapped Just as I was turningat the end of the beaten track I saw aman coming toward a fence I leveledmy double barrel ready to do as I wastold when the fellow set his foot on thefence I expected to see him jump overthe next moment but he seemed tohesitate He nfaj be watching me Ithought looking steadily at him andcovering every movement he mightmake with my gun I refrained fromshooting only because I did not want toraise the commotion which my shotwould entail wifhout being absolutelysure of my businessIt seemed to me that I stood forhours glued to the spot There wasthat fence that man with his foot on itready to swing his body over that intense longing to shoot yet a sort ofsober afterthought bidding me to waituntil he had made another move Themove never cameGradually dawn crept over the timber At its first faint rays I felt relieved Xow I would see my man moreplainly He too would see me and dosomething more than rest his foot onthe fence railThe stars withdrew one by one andall at once there was no fence therewas no man there was not even astump that looked like a man My eyesached from the strain of gazing so hardat that one imaginary object peeringthrough the darkness to see it cometoward me Yes it was an intense reliefto find that I had been mistaken but itwas a matter of still greater congratulation to me that I had not been beguiled into rousing the entire campfrom its peaceful slumber by the creatures of my overvivid

stores and their methodsThe problem presented is a difficultone with which to deal but while merchants have a right to display theirgoods the public also has rights andduties in the matter If a bankerdumped his cash on tables outside hisdesk railings and let people handle itat will he would not get much sympathy when he complained that it hadbeen stolen And if he continued thepractice because their losses were morefthan offset by the increased prpfitsvvhichthe display resulted in as is thecase with the department stores therewould be much justice in the claim thathe had no right to make profits by anymethod which tended to debauch thepublic In short it may be f airly maintained that It is a prime dnfy of everycitizen to exercise reasonable diligenceln safeguarding his own

sacredness of heir presence WhenMr Browning returned with her on avisit to England after an absejnee ofseveral years he repaired to the littlechurch in which thdylhadtbeeii marriedand there at the entrance he reverentlykneeled and kissed the paving stonesupon which she the light of his beinghad stepped And in affer years whenthe light had gouefrom his life hesought this sacred spot on the twelfthof each September and in the dusk ofthe evening shadows passers by mighthave seen a white haired man kneelingfor a moment as if in prayer before thedoorway of the dark and silent churchYet

at least familiar to all fondffarents that children without exceptionike to play the piano with the hard pedalon all the time All children like to make allthe noise they can in playing the piano as ineverything else Playing upon the pianowithout the heavy pedal does not disturb meat all but the minute the heavy pedal is puton I am greatly disturbed and the continuedresounding of the notes fairly racks meOf course I cant be forever saying dontand its ungracious to say it at all I supposefor why shouldnt the children have theirfun And so I hit upon the desperate expedient of blocking the heavy pedal I havewhittled out a nice little piece of soft whitepine into a plug that just fits into the spaceunder the pedal in the opening in which itworks so that the pedal cannot be depressedVlt has only been there two days now butit has been two days of blessed relief Itcant last much longer because the childrenare liable to ask me any minute whats thematter I wonder they havent asked melong ago and of course Ill have to tell embut I am grateful for the rest I have had andthe respite has given me strength the betterto withstand for a time at least the uproarthat will surely come when the children discover the plug N Y SunOn Wednesday July 20th the ClevelandAkron Columbus Ry will run an excursionfrom Columbus Zanesville and intermediatestations to Niagara Falls via Cleveland andthe
