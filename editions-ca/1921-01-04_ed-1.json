the groom for the reception of hia, queer that a statement with all the

I that the oil concerns have actually

now arranged to discontinue the sale

In view of this admassion it wili j
be interesting to follow the processes j
of organizations like the Federal
Trade Commission, which is inter- j
esting itsef very vigorously in the t
coal situation. For coal.' likejoil, is j
