POBTUGUESE PIRATE
HOW BARTHOLEMY CAPTURED A
HUGE SPANISH MERCHANTMAN
Hla First Attack Failed The Little Pirate
Then Lay Within Short Range and With
Rifles the Spanish Force Was Reduced
and Finally Conquered
A series of sketches by Frank E
Stockton on The Buccaneers of Our
Coast is one of the features of St
Nicholas Mr Stockton ttlls of the ad
ventures of Bartholemy Portuguez
who with a small crow in a small ves
sel captured a huge Spanish merchant
man in the Caribbean sea Mr Stockton
says The little pirate sailed boldly to
ward the big Spaniard and the latter
vessel utterly astonished at the audac
ity of this attack frr the pirates flag
was flying lay to head to the wind
and waited the gunners standing by
their cannon When the pirates had
come near enough to see and understand
the size and power of the vessel they
had thought of attacking they did not
as might have been expected put about
and sail away at the best of their ves
sels speed but they kept straight on
their course as if they were about to
fall upon a great unwieldy merchant
man manned by common sailors
Perceiving the foolhardiness of the
little vessel the Spanish commander
determined to give it a lesson which
would teach its captain to understand
better the relative power of great ves
sels and little ones so as soon as the
pirates vessel was near enough he or
dered a broadside fired upon it The
Spanish ship had a great many people
j on board It had a crew of 70 men and
VlQCirloa fllOCO i lCYrk TlTOrO CnrtlA rnrrrn
uuiuuo iiivcu uijiv yyiu ovjxjjo Uacacii
gers and regular marines and know
ing that the captain had determined to
fire upon the approaching vessel every
body had gathbicd on deck to seo tbe
little pirate ship go down
But the ten great cannon balls which
were shot out at Eartholemys little
craft all mised their im and before the
guns could be reloaded or the great ship
be got around so as to deliver her other
broadside the pi a re vessel was along
side of her Eartholemy had fired none
of his cannou Such guns were useless
against so huge a foe What he was aft
er was a hand to hand combat on the
deck of the Spanish ship
The pirates were all ready for hot
work They had thrown aside their
coats and shirts as if each of them were
going into a prizefight and with their
cutlasses in their hands and their
tols and knives in their belts they
scrrrabled like monkeys up the sides of
the great ship But Spaniards are brave
men and good fighters there were more
than twice as many of them as there
were of the pirates and it was not
long before the latter found out that
they could not capture that vessel by
boarding it So over the side they tum
bled as fast as they could go leaving
some of their number dead and wounded
behind them They jumped into their
own vessel and then they putGa
short distance to take breath and get
ready for a different kind of fightf Tlie
triumphant Spaniards now prepared to
get rid of this boatload of half naked
wild beasts which they could easily do
if they took better aim with their can
non than they had done before
But to their amazement they soon
found that they could do nothing with
the guns nor were they able to work
their ship so as to get it into position
for effectual shots Bartholemy and his
men laid aside their cutlasses and their
pistols and took up muskets with which
they were well provided Their vessel
lay within very short range of the Span
ish ship and whenever a man coulcl be
seen through the portholes or showed
himself in the rigging or anywhere else
where it was necessary to go in order
to work the ship he made himself a tar
get for the good aim of the pirates The
pirate vessel could move about as it
pleased for it required but a few men
to manage it and so it kept out of
the way of the Spanish guns and its
best marksmen crouching close to the
deck fired and fired whenever a Span
ish head was to be seen
For five long hours this unequal con
test was kept up It might have re
minded one of a man with a slender rod
and a long delicate line who had
hooked a big salmon The man could
not pull in the salmon but on the other
hand the salmon could not hurt the
man and in the course of time the big
fish would be tired out and the man
would get out his landing net and scoop
him in
Now Bartholemy thought he could
scoop in the Spanish vessel So many
of her men had been shot that the two
crews would be more nearly equal So
he boldly ran his vessel alongside the
big ship and again boarded her Then
there was another great fight on the
decks The Spaniards had ceased to be
triumphant but they had become des
perate and in the furious combat ten
of the pirates were killed and four
wounded- But the Spaniards fared
worse than that More than half of the
men who had not been shot by the pi
rates went down before their cutlasses
and pistols and it was not long before
Bartholemy had captured the great
Spanish ship
It was a fearful and a oostly victory
he had gained A great part of his own
men were lying dead or helpless on the
deck and of the Spaniards only 40 were
left alive and these it appears from
the accounts must have been nearly all
wounded or disabled
Dont Imj It
I have no place to lay my head
ehe sobbed
Her good fairy at once appeared
Be careful then urged the latter
waving her wand that you dont lose
it
Gliding to the front of the stage the
enchantress let it be understood that
there would be a calorific period in the
ancient municipality that evening
