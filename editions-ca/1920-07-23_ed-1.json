HARNEY.
Dispatches in the daily papers
of Tuesday told of the killing of a
Bourbon county man, Lee Davis
Harney, by George Sanders, a ten
ant on the Harney farm, near
Bardstown, in Nelson county. The
killing was caused by an alterca
tion between the men over a crop of
oats.
Harney resided in this county for
several years, having been engaged
in raising tobacco near Paris. He
later moved to Fayette county, and
a year or more ago he purchased a
farm in Nelson county, where he
had since resided. He was about
sixty years old, and is survived by
his widow, Mrs. Nellie Harney; one
daughter, Mrs. Chas. Cassity, of
near Lexington; five brothers,
William, George, Grover, Ben and
Floyd Harney, all of Lexington;
three sisters, Mrs. Frank Strawder,
of Muncie, Indiana; Mrs. Chambers
Buckley, and Miss Maggie Harney,
of Illinois.
The body was 'taken to Lexington,
where the funeral was held Wednes
day morning, with services conduct
ed by Rev. Frank T. Mclntyre, pas
tor of the Ep worth Methodist
church, of Lexington. The inter
ment followed on the family lot in
the Lexington Cemetery.

HOPKINS BAKER.
Though the bride-elect had but
fourteen tender years to her credit,
,and the groom-to-be had reached
the age of twenty, Miss Dora Hop
kins and Frank Baker, both of near
Shawhan, secured a marriage
license Tuesday from County Clerk
Pearce Paton, and were married by
County Judge George Batter ton in
his private office in the court house.
When the -.accommodating Clerk
politely suggested a possibility of
refusal, on account of the too
youthful appearance of the would
be bride, she blushingly turned her
back and from the depths of some
where, produced a document signed
by her lather, Robert Hopkins, giv
ing the parental consent. After
seeing the sights'of Paris the newly-weds
returned to the home of the
groom, near Shawhan.

dell Senter, of Bristol, Va., and Haz
ard, Ky., was quietly solemnized
Tuesday afternoon at the home of

den, on Vine street. Rev. W. E.
Ellis, pastor of the Paris Christian
church, officiated. Only members of
the immediate family and a few in
timate friends of the bride and
groom were present to witness the j
ceremony.

tractive and highly Accomplished
young women of the county, and is
a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D. C.
Lisle, residing near Paris. The,
groom is a successful young busi
ness man of Bristol, and has for

Meade, aged eighteen, and Mr. Mil
ton Hornback. aged twenty, both of
Paris, motored to Cynthiana, and

The young people had been sweet
hearts for some time, but the date
of their marriage had never been
finally settled upon. A few nights
ago while riding with Miss Bessie
King and Walter Williams, both of
Paris, they made a trip to Cynthi
ana. On arriying there their com
panions suggested that the young
couple be married, but this met
with only a faint approval by Miss
Meade. Leaving the party ostensi
bly for the purpose of obtaining re
freshments for them, Mr. Williams
soon returned bringing with him a
marriage license and Rev. Struve.
The ceiemony was pei formed, and
the party returned to Paris. The
next day the bride and her mother
left for Muncie, Ind., Mrs. Meade
not knowing that her daughter had
been married.

and Mis. Henry Meade, of South
