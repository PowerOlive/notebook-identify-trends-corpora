American SubjectsManila Sept 19 In an interviewhere with Archbishop Dozal of thePhilippine islands said I earnestlyhope the islands will not remain Spanish -because the rebels are now scstrong- that such a course would inevitably cause appalling- bloodshed There conquest of the natives is impossibleuntil after years of the most cruelwarfarelie also expressed the hope that theislands would not become absolutelyindependent because it was certainthat dissensions would occur whichwould result in incessant strife and alapse into barbarism and the naturalindolence of the tropical race Theonly hope the archbishop declaredwas that a strong- western powerwould intervene now Dela3was dangerous because the people are intoxicated vainglorious and restlessHe said it was undeniable that thereligious orders must g o because thewhole people had determined to abolish them now that they were able tcrender their retention impossibleHe lay the chief blame upon theDominicans Aug ustins und Franciscan receletans the richest ordersand next upon the Benedictinesand Capuchians which are of less importance The Jesuits ArchbishopDozal says are comparatively blameless He added that the rival ordersquarrel among- themselves intrigueact unworthily and slander their opponents thus increasing- their generaldisfavorThe provinciales who are approximately equivalent to archdeacons aremainly responsible They are utterlybeyond the control of the archbishopwho denies possessing- much powerThe total number of Spanish priestsin the Philippines before the war wasabout one thousand but lately everydeparting- steamer has taken fifty or ahundred of them away now barely500 remain A native priest privatelystated to the correspondent that thereason the archbishop hopes for theexpulsion of the friarly orders is thatthey have grown too powerful for himand that he wishes to strengthen himself Several responsible Spaniardsassured the correspondent thatthey would refuse to remainhere if Spain was reinstated injtfhe control of the islands Manyof th Spanish soldiers refuse toserve again and Spanish officers arem tterl5dijgistedwithfc the Rottennessof Spains government and prefer tobecome

Mrs JCanuary a group of six children theeldest ofwhom was Martha Whenwas lu jears old that is in 18G5excitement was rampant throughoutthe United States owing to the extensive gold discoveries in Montana Mra unary was not proof against thefever and with his familj he startedoverland for Virginia City Mont inthe famous Alder gulch diggings Fivemonths were required to make thejourney while at present but two daysare requisite The country traversedwas but sparsely settled and for subsistence the party was mainly dependent upon what game they could securewith their rifles On this long andtedious trip Martha developed a lovefor outdoor sport which by the timethey finally arrived in Montana hadrendered her a remarkably good shotand a fearless rider for a girl of herageShortly after reaching Montana themother died and the father who incommon with 95 per cent of the argonauts had failed to make a strikedetermined to return to MissouriReaching Salt Lake City Utah in 18G7Mr Cannary also succumbed and thechildren were left to face the worldas best they could Employment wasfound for Martha on a ranch at FortBridgcr Wyo and here she improvedher time not in book learning forbooks were not to be had but at shooting and riding as the next best accomplishment and her reputation in thatline soon became widespreadIn 1S70 learning that Ger Custerwas at Fort Russell Wyo she determined to proceed thither in high hopethat she might be able lo induce himto ailow her to accompany him on -hiscampaign against the Apache Indiansjr Arizona Up to this time she hadalways worn the dress of her sex butfearing that Gen Custer would be reluctant to permit her to enlist werehv aware of her sex she after muchdeliberation donned the regulationcowboy attire and was promptly accepted as a scout being uniformed asa soldier and although it was but ashort time before her identity was discovered her ability as a rid21 was recognized to such an extent that GenCuster with only a slight reprimandor the deception permitted her to rein her assignment as a scoutWhile the campaign was a thrillingone from start to finish M Cannarvas her name appeared on the musterroll fully bor her share of the hardship and met with many adventuresin the sometimes dangerous missionsgiven her to be performed but theseshe always succeeded in accomplishing in safety Only at one time did shedespair of he

and anexpedition under Gens Custer MilesTerry and Crook was ordered thereIt was during this campaign that shereceived her cognomen CalamityJane Relating the circumstancesthereof she said I was serving under Capt Egar and while near GooseCreek the present city of SheridanWyo after having been on a threedays skirmish during which the company had six men killed and severalwounded we were ambushed about amile from our destination CaptEgan was one of the first to be shotduring the engagement and I happening to be in close proximity to him noticed him reeling in his saddle I wasable to reach his side in time to prevent him from falling and gettinghim on ray horse in front of me borehim to camp in safety After he hadrecovered one day he laughinglychristened me Calamity Jane theheroine of the plains and even to thisday I have borne that title among mymore intimate friendsThe Nez Perces were subdued in1S73 and the early portion of 1871 wasspent in various minor engagementsin Montana and Wyoming when in1875 under Gen Crook she was ordered to the Black Hills of South Dakota to protect the miners and settlers in that section as the countrywas overrun and practically controlled by the Sioux Indians After anominal campaign in that sectionlasting until 1S75 they were again ordered north to join Gens Custer Milesand Terry on the Big Horn riverDuring this march Mrs Burk wasdetailed as the bearer of importantdispatches and although the trip wasone of 90 miles the weather wet andcold and it necessitated swimmingthe Platte rivei at Fort Fettermanshe performed her duty willingly butat
