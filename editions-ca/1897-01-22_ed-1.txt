Throws Some Ijlght onthe General Scope of the ArbitrationTreatyWashington Jan 21 Secretary oiState Olney appeared before the foreign relations committee Wednesdayand was questioned closely as to thegeneral scope of the arbitration treatywith Great Britain Mr Olney statedthat it did not include the arbitrationof the Monroe doctrine and was sounderstood by this government andGreat Britain The matters in disputethat would come under the provisionsof the convention were such as mightgrow out of treaty rignts or under international lawAt the conclusion of Mr Olneys argument he was asked what objectionthere could be to the insertion of aclause relative to the Monroe doctrineif both governments understood thesubject alike but to this question it isunderstood Mr Olney gave no specificanswerTn ftlnhnratincr his statement thatthe Monroe doctrine would not comewithin the terms of the general treatyof arbitration Mr Olney told the committee that it is well understoodbv the negotiators of the convention that all questions relatingto the foreign policy of eithergovernment were not intended to beincluded in the terms of the treaty Itis understood however that whenpressed on the subject of the Nicaraguan canal Mr Oiney said that ifGreat Britain sought to make an issueon that subject growing out of theterms of the existing Clayton Bulwartreaty it would probably come withinthis general treaty under that clausewhich provides for the settlement ofdisputes arising between the two governments under treaties or otherwiseMr Olney insisted that there was nogound for the

hearts may be heavy with care or woeYet ever as drearily on we goWe hope for a glad to morrowWe may look with scornOn to day forlornAnd our souls with the burden of life bewornBut to morrowTo morrowTo morrowA happier day shall dawn- Out to the unknown we swiftly glideOer the river of life so deep and wideAnd ever new faith we borrowFor the way of God is a wondrous wayAnd it leads by the path of the stern todayTo the edge of a glad to morrowWe know not howIt shall come but ThouO Lord dost nothing but good allowAnd to morrowTo morrowTo morrowWe shall learn the truth which we knownot nowSometimes it seems that the world is darkAll silent the song of the thriish and larkAnd vanished all else but sorrowBut over the edge of the darkest nightThere waits a sunrise serene and brightAnd life will be

investing moneyTrust me this time father I shallnever ask you for any moreThe old man went slowly to his deskwrote out a check and handed it to hisIt was for 30000CHAPTEE XXTIIEdith Longworth with that preciousbit of paper in her pocket once moregot into her hansom and drove to Wentrworths office Again she took the onlyeasy chair in the room Her face wasvery serious and Wentworth the moment he saw it said to himself Shehas failedHave you telegraphed to Mr Kenyon she askedYesAre you sure you made it clear tohim what was wanted Cablegramsare apt to be rather briefI told him to keep in communicationwith us Here is a copy of the cablegramMiss Longworth read it approvinglybut saidYou have not put in the word answerNo but I put it in the dispatch Isent I remember that nowHave you had an answer yetOh no you see it takes a long timeto get there because there are so manychanges from the end of the cable tothe office at which Kenyon is Andthen again you see they may have tolook for him He may not be expectinga message in fact he is sure not to beexpecting any From his own cablegram to me it is quite evident he hasgiven up all hopeShow me that cablegram pleaseWentworth hesitated It is hardlycouched in language you will like toread he saidThat doesnt matter Show it tome I must see all the documents in thecase He handed her the paper whichshe read in silence and gave it back tohim without a wordI knew you wouldnt like it hesaidI have not said I do not like it It isnot a bit too strong under the circumstances In fact I do not see how hecould have put it in other words It isvery concise and to the pointYes there is no doubt about thatespecially the first three words We arecheated Those are the words thatmake me think Kenyon has given upall hope and so there will be some difficulty in finding himDid you learn whether money couldbe sent by cable or notOh yes there is no difficulty aboutthat The money is deposited in a bankhere and will be credited to Kenyon inthe bank at OttawaVery well then said Miss Longworth handing him the piece of paperthere is the moneyWentworth gave a long whistle as helooked at itExcuse my rudeness he said Idont see a bit oi paper like this everyday You mean then to buy themineYes I mean to buy the mineVery well but there is 10000 morehere than is necessaryYes I mean not only to buy themine but to work it and some workingcapital will be necessary How muchdo you supposeAbout that said Wentworth Ihave no idea I should think that5000 would be ampleThen we will leave 5000 in tinbank here for the contingencies andwe will cable 25000 to Mr Kenyon1 shall expect him to get me a goodman to manage the mine I am surehe will be glad to do thatMost certainly he will John Kenyon now that the mine has not falleninto the hands of those who tried tocheat him will be glad to do anythingfor the new owner of it He wontmind in the least losing his money ifhe knows that you have the mineAh but that is the one thing he mustnot know As to losing the moneyueither you nor Mr Kenyon are to losea penny If the mine is all you thinkit is then it will be a very profitableinvestment and 1 intend that we shalleach take our third just as if you hadcontributed one third of the money andMr Kenyon the otherBut iny dear Miss Longworth thatis absurd We could never accept anysuch termsOh yes you can I spoke to JohnKenyon myself about being a partnerin this mine I am afraid he thoughtvery little about it at the time I dontintend him to know anything at allabout my ownership now He has discovered the mine you and he together If it is valueless then you andhe will be two of tlie sufferers if itis all you think it is then you will bethe gainers The laborer is worthy ofhis hire and I am sure both you andMr Kenyon have labored hard enoughin this venture If he knows I havebought it the chances are he will be stupidly and stubbornly conscientiousand will take none of the fruits of hislaborsAnd you think Miss Longworth Iam not conscientious enough to icfuseOh yes you are conscientious butyou are sensible Mr Kenyon isntI think you are mistaken about thatHe is one of the most sensible men inthe world morbidly sensible perhapsWell I think if Mr Kenyon knew Iowned the mine he would not take aTHE UOURBON NEWS FEXDJY JANUARY 22 1897penny as hishare So I trustyou willnever let him know I am the person whogave the money to buy the mineBut is he never to know it MissLongworthPerhaps not But if he is to know Iam the person to tell himI quite agree with you there and Ishall respect your confidenceNow what time said the younglady looking at her watch ought we toget an answer from Mr KenyonAh that as I said before no one cantellI suppose then the best plan is tosend the money at once or put it in theway of being sent to some bank inOttawaYes that is the best thing to doalthough of course if John Kenyon isnot thereIf he is not there what shall we doI do not exactly know I could cableto Mr Von Brent Von Brent is the owner of the mine and the man who gaveJohn the option I do not know howfar he is committed to the others Ifhe is as honest is I take him to be hewill accept the money provided it issent in before twelve oclock and thenwe shall have the mine Of that I knownothing however because I have noparticulars except Johns cable messageThen I can do no more just nowYes you can You will have towrite out a check for the 25000 Yousee this check is crossed and will gointo your banking account Anothercheck will have to be drawn to get themoney outAh I see I have not my check bookhere but perhaps you can send thischeck to the bank and I will returnThere wili be time enough I supposebefore the closing hour of the bankYes there will be plenty of timeOf course the sooner we get the moneyaway the betterI will re turn shortly after lunchPerhaps you will have heard from MrKenyon by then If anything comessooner will you send me a telegramHere is my addressI will do that said Wentworth ashe bade her good byAs soon as lunch was over Miss Longworth with her check book went againto Wentworths office When she entered he shook his headNo news yet he saidThis is terrible she answeredSuppose he has left Ottawa and started for homeI do not think he would do thatStill I imagine he would think therewas no reason for staying in OttawaNevertheless I know Kenyon wellenough to believe that he will waitthere till the last minute of the optionhas expired in the hope that somethingmay happen He knows of course that-iDont spare money on it said the young ladyBe sure and make it plain to himI shall be doing everything I can inLondon and he may have a faint expectation that I shall be able to accomplish somethingIt would be useless to cable againQuite If -that message does notreach him none willAs he was speaking a boy entered theroom with a telegram in his hand Itscontents were short and to the pointCablegram received KenyonWell thats all rjght said Wentworth Now I shall cable that we havethe money and tell him to identify himself at the bank so that there will be noformalities about the drawing of it todetain him Saying this Wentworthpulled the telegram forms toward himand after considerable labor managedto concoct a dispatch that seemed tosatisfy himDont spare monej on it said theyoung lady Be sure and make itplain to himI think that will do dont youYes she answered after readingthe dispatch that will doNow she said here is the checkI will wait here while you do all that isnecessary to cable the inoney or hadI better go and return again to see ifeverything is all rightIf you dont mind just sit whereyo are You may lock the door if youlike and you will not be disturbedIt was an hour before Wentworth returned but his face was radiant Wehave done everything we can he saidThe money is at his order there if thecablegram gets over before twelveoclock to morrow as I think it willVery well then Good by said thegirl holding out her hand with a smileI am Mistress of the Mine Mr WentworthCHAPTER XXTVIf any man more miserable and dejected than John Kenyon lived in thebroad Dominion of Canada he was indeed a person to be pitied After having sent his cablegram to Wentworthhe went to his very cheerless hotel andnextmorning when he woke up he knewthat Wentworth would have receivedthat message but that the chances wereten thousand to one that he could notget the money in time even if he couldget it at all Still he resolved to stay inOttawa much as he detested the placeuntil the hour of option expired Thenihe thought he would look aroundJamong the mines and see if he could notget something to do in the managementof one of them This would enable nimto make some money and to help payoffvthe indebtedness which he andWentworth would owe in London as aresult of their disastrous speculationHejtfelt so depressed that he did whatmost other Englishmen would havedone in his place he took a long walkHestood on the bridge over the Ottawariver and gazed for a little while at theChandiere falls with the mist risingfrom the chasm into which the watersplunged Then he walked along theother side of the river among the bigsawmills and huge interminable piles oflumber with their grateful piney smellBy and by he found himself in the country and then the forest closed in uponthe bad road on which he walked Nevertheless he kept on and on withoutheeding where he was going Hereand there he saw clearings in the woodsand a log shanty or perhaps a barnThe result of all this was that being ahealthy man he soon developed anenormous appetite which forced itselfupon his attention in spite of his depression He noticed the evening wasclosing around him and so was glad tocome to a farmhouse that looked betterthan the ordinary shanty he had leftbehind Here he asked for food andsoon sat down to a plentiful meal thecoarseness of which was more thancompensated for by the excellence ofhis appetite After dinner he began torealize how tired he was and felt astonished to hear from his host how fair hewas from OttawaYou cant get there to night saidthe farmer it is no use your tryingYou stay with us to night and Ill takeyou in to morrow Im going there inthe afternoon

morning when a Spanish gunboat was cunk by means of a torpedoand many of her crew killed A detachment of rebels had made an attackupon the forts at Guamo some distanceup the Cauto river province of Santiago de Cuba and the Spanish troopsfearing that they would not be able tohold out asked for assistance fromManzanilloon the coast Ou Saturdaynight the gunboats Centineli and Relampago left Manzanillo under ordersto ascend the river and protect theforts The commander of the gunboats used all possible speed in runningup the coast to the mouth of the riverbut when they began to ascend theyproceeded very cautiously suspectingthat the rebels might have planted torpedoes in the channel All went welluntil the gunboats were opposite aplace called Mango when despite allthe precautions that had been takenthe Relampago struck a torpedo Instantly there was a terrific explosionand masses of water were hurled to agreat height The hull of the Relampago was torn open and she at oncebegan to sink There was no time tolower a boat and almost before theextent of the disaster could be realizedthe vessel went down Those on boardwho were not injured jumped into thewater and made their way the bestthey could in the direction of the Centineli As soon as it was seen that theRelampago was sinking the Centineli boats were ordered tothe rescue The rebels appearedto be in strong force alongthe banks of the river and when theysaw the Spaniards in the water theydirected a heavy rifle fire upon themThe Centineli opened fire upon therebels but as they could not be seenand their positions could only be discovered by the smoke from their gunsit is not believed that any serious losseswere inflicted upon themWhen the Centinelis boats attemted to rescue the men struggling in thewater the rebels fired upon them butthe Spaniards bravely persisted intheir work of rescue until all the menhad been taken from the waterThe commander of the Centineli wasso seriously wounded that doubts areentertained for his recoveryThe condition of the survivors wassuch that it was impossible for theCentineli to proceed to Guamo andshe therefore returned to Manzanillowhere the news of the disaster causedintense excitementThe official report of the affair statesthat the commander second engineerand three sailors of the Relampagowere killed and her boatswain quartermaster chief engineer

DealA federal judge lately charged a juryin a liquor case as follows In lateryears there seems to have been a disposition to deny or ignore judicialknowledge as to what constitutes intoxicating liquors and the courts havemanifested a desire to disavow anyjudicial knowledge of this subject Atthe same time some of the courtshave not hesitated to impute to injuriesan extensive knowledge and information in this regard This court however will follow the precedent established by the decision of ChancellorWalworth upon this subject and willasusme judicial knowledge concerningintoxicating liquors In atrial in the state of Wisconsin wherethis question arose in 18S3 lixe trialjudge declared that a man must be almost a driveling idiot who did notknow what beer was and that it wasnot necessary to prove it to be anliquorLater the supreme court of thatstate in passing on the character of thetrial declared that his rulings in thecase upon this question were not onlyclearly correct but if his peculiar manner gave them force and emphasis itwas not only proper but commendableThis court therefore will neither stultify itself nor impeach its own veracityby telling you that it has not judicialknowledge that liquor commonlyknown as whisky is an intoxicatingliquor or that the drink commonlycalled whisky cocktail is an intoxicatrJ iug drink Lease and CommentV xivrRIGHT ON THE

and love of experiment in grafting-these wild stocks with improvednative and foreign varieties Severalyears ago my attention was attractedto this subject by an article which appeared in the report of our State Horticultural society from a correspondentin Illinois who said A farmer livingnear here having- a woods pasture partly covered with wild crab and red hawtrees some 15 or 0 years ago graftedthe crab to apple and the red haw topear He grafted those limbs beyondthe reach of animals grazing in thepasture and now he has apples andpears in abundance every fruit yearDuring- the past year the writer madea number of experiments in graftingthe wild fruits in this locality begungrafting the haw to the pear duringpleasant days in February and continued after intervals till the 10th ofApril Those grafts set during February did much better than those of laterdates Scions were taken from JBartlettIdaho Duchess and Ivieffer trees xvmuch larger per cent of the Kicllergrafts grew than those of other varieties and the growth was more vigorousWe also set grafts of the pear into thewhite thorn but failed to get any tolive In grafting the haw it is bestto select young vigorous trees and locate the grafts well in the top of thetree so they will get the sunlight andbave room to develop In the early daysof March we grafted some wild plumtrees with the Japanese varieties Abundance and Burl auk The growth madeby these scions was very vigorous andthey are now full of fruit budsIn grafting use an abundance ofgrafting wax and cover with a cottoncloth boiled in oil or wax Aside
