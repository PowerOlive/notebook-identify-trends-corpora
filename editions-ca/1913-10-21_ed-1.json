Harrison Stewart, colored, aged
about 65, died Thursday of acute in
digestion. During the day he was ap
parently in good health. He was em
ployed as a domestic in the home of
iMr. J. G. Allen. In the afternoon of
the day of his death he was picking
pears. About four o'clock he came
to the house with,, about two baskets
of pears. After Mr. Allen and son,
S. M. Allen, returned home from the
Jjank they found that "Uncle Harri
son," as he was called, had not done
his eening work. Mr. S. M. Allen
called him and receiving no reply
went out in search of him. He was
found in the garden under the pear
tree where he had fallen forward in
a crouching position, with a basket
G3 either side of him. Life had been
extinct but for a short time, as the
iody was still warm and limp. "Un
. cle Harrison" was a popular colored
man and well thought of by both
vnite and colored. He was a devout
jnember of the colored Baptist church
and was polite and gentlemanly in his
deportment. He was a native of Lin
coln county, but had been employed
as a domestic in the Allen home for a
number of years. He was buried
Sunday afternoon in the colored cem
etery, after services at the colored
3aptist church.

edifices to be found in any rural dis
trict. It is beautifully located on a
large lot that has a frontage of 300
feet and a depth of 600 feet, well grad
ed and terraced. Concrete walks and
drives of crushed stone have been
laid wherever necessary. The church
is built of concrete bricks with free
stone foundation forming 'the first
story. Broad digits of concrete steps
lead up to the vestibule, which is sup
proted by large pillars. Aporte
cochere, the roof supported by white
pillars, is on each side of the church,
and the whole has a metal roof with
a dome in the ' center of the main
part.
The main auditorium is a beauti
ful, well-lighted room, having a bal
cony suported with white columns ex
tending around three sides. The bap
tistry is on the left side of the pulpit
and the organ lofte on the right
while the large pipe organ occupies
the recess back of the pulpit. The
main room has a seating capacity of
350, and the balcony 250, making a
total seating capacity of 600.
On the same floor with the audi
torium are the pastor's study, a
commodious room and the ladies' par
lor, which is cozy and attractive. In
the lower, story is the Sunday School
assembly room furnished with opera
chairs and the pulpit furniture from
the old chureh.
The former church building which
has been replaced by the handsome
new edifice, was erected in 1842, and
its walls have resounded with elo
quent sermons exhortations from the
lips of" some of the most noted preach
ers of this denomination, viz: Aylette
Rains, Moses E. Lard, Robert Gra
ham, John T. Johnston, C. M. Arnold,
E. V. Zollers, William McGarvey and
others. Elder L. H. Reynolds was
pastor of the church for about six
years, but on account of advancing
age he resigned, and was succeeded
by Elder W. S. Willis. Elder J. W.
Ligon was the beloved pastor until
his resignation about two years ago,
and Elder Christopherson is the pres
ent pastor.
It is not known what disposition
the members will make of the old
building, but it will likely be used for
a hall where lectures and entertain
ments may be given.
The new church is beautifully dec
orated. In the main auditorium the
walls are tinted a delicate green, the
ceiling and dome being cream color
with border in harmonizing tints,
1 with the softly colore'd art windows.
The entire floor is covered with a
velvet carpet in two tones of green,
moire pattern. This and some of the
furnishings were the gift of the wo
men of the congregation, whd raised
$1,200 among themselves. The com
fortable pews are in mahogany finish
as is the organ with its gilded pipes.

The elegant pulpit furniture, consist

leather chairs, communion table and
two chairs, all in mahogany, was the
generous gift of Mr. John T. Hinton,
of Paris.
Sixteen beautiful memorial "windows
grace the church which were donated j
by the following: Mr. W. S. Jones,
Mrs. Ed. Rice, Judge H. C. Smith,
Mrs. Thomas Helm Clay and Mrs.

The large, sweet-tonedd organ was
the gift of the young men of the con
gregation, and cost the sum of $2,000.
The architect of this beautiful
structure, who was also the contrac
tor, was W. K. Hagan, a resident of
North Middletown, and one of the
deacons ofthe congregation.
Every department of the church
work is in a flourishing condition.
The Sunday School is one of the best
to be found anywhere, under the ca
pable superintendency of Mr. John
Willie Jones and the C. W. B. M. has
a large membership.
The total cost of the church was
-$25,000 and it was raised with very
little trouble. The contributions were
willingly and cheerfully paid, and
not a dollar asked for at the dedi
cation, which is unusual and remark
able. The officers of the church are as
follows :
Elders W. S. Jones, J. W. Young,
H. C. Smith, John T. Collins, Jno. W.
Jones, Dr. L. R. Henry.
Deacons Charles H. Meng, Dr. R.

would be circulated the next day en

"The Children of To-day" at Ben Ali.
The new Ben Ali theatre, at Lex
ington, will have as its attraction
on Monday, Oct. 27, "The Children of
To-day," under the direction of the
Messrs. 'Shubert, with Mr. Louis
Mann in the leading role.
"Children of To-day" is a modern
comedy. Mrs. Wakefield, a widow,
with two children, Vincent and Anita,
aged seventeen and eighteen, finds
herself unable to control her off
springs. They are infact, children of
today and pay little attention to their
mother and run things to suit them
selves. The mother is in love with an
old friend of the family, Mr. Ran
dolph, but when the two children in
terview him, he is promptly rejected
as not measuring up to their quali
fications as to what amodern father
and husband should be. But here the
wise itfr. Randolph set out to outwit
the children and he does so to the
great amusement of the widow, to say
nothing of that of the audience. Mr.
Mann himself rehearsed the company
and staged the production.
Mr. Mann's supporting company is
one of unusual merit. His leading
woman is Miss Emily Ann Wellman,
well known for her excellent support
of Mr. Mann for the past four years.
Others in the company include John
Hines, Adoni Fevieri, Frank R. Stir
ling, Maud Turner Gordon and Mar
garet Templeton.

ELEVEN MILLION INCREASE IN
L. & N. FRANCHISE VALUATION.
Judge Cochran, in Federal Court, at
Frankfort, Friday, handed down an
opinion that the L. & N. should pav
taxes on $11,000,000 more before it is
entitled to a temporary injunction re
straining the State from collecting
taxes on the aVnount its 1912 assess
ment was diminished over the year
previous.
This is just half the amount tlm
State Board of Valuation and Assess
ment assessed it, and is double tha
amount the road conceded to be a
fair assessment.
Incidentally, Judge Cochran said
he had no doubt the property of the
L. & X. was worth what the Board
assessed it, $74,598,451. but wheth-p
such a value can be worked out bv-
pursuing the method prescribed by
the statute is a question.
He found the amount, which he said
the road must pay before he grants
the injunction, by taking 70 por'c-nt
nf tviic voinonn hha mo i- .-
nnd
- , ... '
deducting from it the tangible -assess
ment ana tne amount the road paid on
brought suit.
He referred to the fact that in -the
rate case in 1906, in which the road
complained of rebuced rates fixed by
the Railroad Commission, it aliened
that its road, then 229 miles shorter
UlmV ; ? IT. -rt -.-. jnj
Liiau n. is uu, was worm $ t u,oyy,e-i.-41.
In 1911 the L. & N. paid on a fran
chise value- of $11,899,200, but in 1912
this was raised to $54,42S,074 by the
State Board of Valuation and Assess
ment This decision of Judge Cochran,
therefore, puts the amount of, tile

franchise valuation at $22,89,O0)'
