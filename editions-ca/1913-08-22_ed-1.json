were married at the parlors of the

near at hand. Mr. Insko is a son of
Mr. and Mrs. Clem Insko, of this city,

greater part of the time Miss Houston
has held the position as day operator

At the time of their coming here Mr.
Insko was connected with the compa

many of their friends predicted the
marriage. Immediately afer the wed
ding ceremony, they left for Lexing
ton, where they will remain until Sat
urday, after which they will be at
home with their pai ents, Mr. and Mrs.
R. E. Houston, on Vimont street.
They were the recipients of showers
of congratulations. ,

JOHN GREEN WILL FLY
AGAIN AT CHATTANOOGA.
Green's Cardui Flyer.
Chattanooga, August 22. (Special)
The Chairman of the Grand Army
Entertainment Committee, has closed
a contract with Johnny Green, famous
Cardui birdman and waterfowl, to
make three flights in Chattanooga
during the G. A. R. reunion, to be held
in Chattanooga September 15-20.
Green is the man who made the rec
ord flight in Cardui Flyer No. 1 over
Lookout Mountain during the U. C. V.
reunion last May. He was the first
man to attempt that dangerous flight,
refused by so many other prominent
aviators. A feature of his exhibition
next month will be a flight in his Car
dui Flyer No. 2, equipped with hydro
planes, up the Tennessee River. This
will be the first hydroplane flight ever
made by any .Southern aviator.
Visitors to the G. A. R. reunion will
do well not to miss these flights by the
famous avitor, free to all, and should
look out for the dollar bills, which he
'drops among the crowds below, as he
goes hurling through the air.
