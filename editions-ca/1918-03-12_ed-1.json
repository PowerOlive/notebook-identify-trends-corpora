Mr. Thomas E. Savage, aged
sixty-nine, died Saturday about eight
p. m. at the home of his son, Mr. P.
J. Savage, at Paris, after a lingering
illness of a complication of diseases.
Mr. Savage was born March 11, 1849,
at Murphysville, Mason county. He
was a son of Dr. and Mrs. William
Savage, and was one of three chil
dren. One sister survives him, Mrs.
William Hinton, of Paris. Mr. Sav
age and family moved to Millersburg
when their children were quite
young. After Mr. Savage grew to
manhood, he operated a drug store in
Millersburg for a time with his fa
ther. Later he resided at St.
Joseph, Mo., for a time, after which
he held several traveling positions
for Cincinnati commercial houses. In
1889 he accepted a position in the
drug store of Dr. W. M. Miller, and
afterward held the same position
with Mr. H. H. Philips, then with
Smith & Wadell, and for a short time
with W. M. Wadell & Co. He was
also Deputy County Clerk under Mr.
Ed. D. Paton, and later his son, Mr.
Pearce Paton, which position he held
until his health failed him. For a
long time he was notary public, and
has written more wills, deeds, mort
gages and contracts than any other
man in Millersburg;, except Mr. R. 3.
Boulden. He was a devout member
of the Methodist church from boy
hood, and for more than a quarter of
a centry a member -of the offical
board, and for many years, until
broken in health, he was its secre
tary. He was united Tn marriage when
quite a young man to Miss Gertrude
Ingels, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
P. B. Ingles, who preceded him to
the grave some years ago. Five chil
dren was the result of this happy
marriage, three sons, Dr. -Win. E.
Savage, of Cincinnati, Mr. Robert
Savage, who died when a young pian,
and Mr. F. J. Savage, train dispatch
er for the L. & N. R. R. Co., at Paris,
with whom he was temporarily resid
ing at the time of his death; two
daughters, Miss Mary Savage, who
resided with him, and Mrs. A. C.
Clockseim, of Cleveland, 0.
For the past two years Mr. Savaga
has been in failing health, and it was
realized by his family and friends
that the end was slowly approaching.
For a long time he was an invalid,
but able to get around. Last fall
when his health failed so he was no
longer able to get about, he and his
daughter, Miss Maiy Savage, went to
Paris to reside with his son, Mr. F.
J. Savage..' Jlis daughter, Mrs.
Clockseim, of Cleveland, was unable
to attend the funeral on account of
poor health. Prof. Clockseim was
present.
The funeral services were held
Monday at two-thirty p. m., at Mil
lersburg Methodist church, and were
conducted by Rev. J. D. Redd, P. E.,
of the Maysville District, a life-long
friend of the deceased, assisted by his
pastor, Rev. J. W. Gardner. The
music was under the direction of
Mrs. C. ,M. Best, of M. M. I. The1
floral tributes were beautiful and at-j
tested the high esteem in which the
deceased was held by his family, rel-
atives and friends. The remains were '
laid to rest on the family lot by the"
side of his wife and son, in the Mil
lersburg Cemetery, perhaps about the
same hour in the day when sixty-nine
years ago he first beheld the light
and glory of this Jjefcutiful world.
