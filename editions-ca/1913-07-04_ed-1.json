ANIMALS REMEMBER ABUSE
AND FREQUENTLY "GET EVEN."
The following is taken from a little
article entitled "Teasing the Horse"
in the current issue of Farm and
Fireside:
"To tease an animal is unwise, and
even dangerous. Animals never for
get. "I know of two little boys and an
old family mare, not an unusual com
bination on most farms. This old mare
has often been teased by one little
boy, and when he comes near she lays
back her ears, and with flashing eyes
and snapping teeth tries to get at him.
Some time when he is off his guard
perhaps the chance will come, and
who knows what will happen?
"The other lad always petted and
played with the old mare and talked
to her, and she will come to him and
follow him anywhere. When she is
hitched up he can drive her any place,
and she always obeys every word he
says. But he will never tease her, and
she shows her gratitude in her only
way.
"Teasing colts, horses or other dumb
animals shows a streak of hidden
meanness and should not be permitted.
It also spoils the disposition of the
animal; and it would be utterly useless
for them in after years to try to do
anything with the embittered animal
and expect entire success. Brute
force may compel obedience for a
time, but how much better to have
them act from motives of affection
than fear."

L NOTES
SUMMERS-SHOCK.
Miss Emma Louise Summess, ofi
Flemingsburg, and Mr. C. J. Shock, of
Minneapolis, Minn., came to this city,
Wednesday afternoon and were united
in marriage at home of the offici
ating minister, Elder J. T. Sharrard,
on South Main street. The home of
Eld. Sharrard was beautifully deco
rated with pink and red blossoms, and
the wedding march was qlayed by
Miss Mackey.
The bride, who is a very attractive
and popular young woman, wore a be
coming traveling suit with hat to
match The couple were attended by
Miss Lyons, and Mr. and Mrs. Oscar
Mclntyre, of Flemingsburg, and Miss
Emma Collins, of Ewing.

freshments were served the bridal

which Mr. and Mrs. Shock left for Lex
ington, en route to Minneapolis, where

TO THE MOON BY AEROPLANE.
(Chicago Evening Post.)
There are plenty of aviators to fill
the places of the departed, and now
that the Powers have had the recent
illustration of the aeroplane in warfre
aeronautics will be a weii-peopled oc
cupation. But think of the land fly
ers who have time enough to prepare
for a journey to the moon. The suc
cessors to Jules Verne have figured it
all out for the French Society of Phys
ics. The egine for the aeroplane imust
be of 414,000 horsepower. This
would propell a machine weighing a
ton to the moon in forty-eight and one
half hours. It would take twenty
four miutes and nine seconds 'to set
out of the circle of the earth's attrac
tion. Before the force of the moon's
gravity would be encountered there
would be an interval of forty-eight
hours and and fifty-eight seconds of
travel in nothingness. The slack-up
preparatory to landing on the moon
would require three minutes and forty
six seconds.
These figures remind one of the
work of Benjamine Price, the mathe
matician who published a book that
had a sale of approximately 100 copies
and that number represented the total
of persons who could comprehend it
Price need to calculate the weight of
the moon as a diversion, and no
doubt would have reveled in the
problem submitted to the French phy
sicists.
EGG WITHIN AN EGG.
An egg broken at the home of Mack
