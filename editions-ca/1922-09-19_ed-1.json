Mrs. W. J. Ferguson,' of Paris,
suffered a double bereavement in the

ed to Nicholasville on account of the
death of her brother, William Clark,
following a prolonged illness, and
while there was called to Richmond,

DOUBLE WEDDING
A double wedding, in which two
of the principals, both of Bourbon
county, were brother and sister, took
place in Jeffersonville, Indiana, Fri
day. They were two eloping
couples from the Spears Mills vicin:
ity, Thomas Wilson, 20 years old,
farmer, and Miss Margaret Hudnall,
19, of near Spears Mill, and Jesse
Sanders, 22, farmer, and Miss Mabel
Wilson, 18, both of near Paris. The
two couples were united in a double
ceremony by the same minister.
The young people left Paris Fri
day, presumably to attend the State
Fair at Louisville. Miss Hudnall,
now Mrs. Thomas Wilson, is a
daughter of S. R. "Shady" Hudnall,
recently of Paris, and a grand
daughter of John Hudnall, of
Spears Mill. The intention of Mr.
Wilson and Miss Hudnall was dis
covered by her grandfather in a let
ter left behind when they departed.
Mr. Hudnall asked the authorities
to intercept and detain the-elopers,
but Cupid won out, and the young
people successfully eluded pursuit
and defeated efforts to prevent their
marriage.

Following a long illness of neu
ritis and stomach trouble, Isaac N.
Keller, aged seventy-one, one of
best-known farmers of the county,
died at 11:30 o'clock, Saturday
night at his home near Kiserton.
Mr. Keller had been in poor health
for a long time. He visited several
health resorts, but none afforded relief.
Mr. Keller was one of the -most
popular men in the county, and his
home was at all times open and gen
erous in its hospitality. He was an
ardent follower of field sports and
a lover of the great outdoors. He
was generous to a fault, jovial and
full of the fellow-feeling that put
his guests at ease at once. He
was a successful farmer, and a man
of whom it was often said: "He is
one of the best men I ever knew."
Mr. Keller was a son of the late Sol
omon and Elizabeth Keller, of Bour
bon county.
He is survived by his widow, Mrs.
Nannie Kiser Keller; one daughter,
Mrs. Earl Larkin, of Paris; one son,
Edward Keller; one sister, Mrs,
Persley Spears, of Missouri; and one
brother, Jacob Keller, of Kiserton.
The funeral was held at the fam
ily home near Kiserton,, yesterday
morning at 10:30 o'clock, with ser
vices conducted by Rev. W. E. Ellis,
pastor of the Paris Christian church.
afternoon, atTne burial followed in the Paris
npmpt-prv ' 'hfi nan - Hearers
were: Kenney "Kiser, Miller Kiser,
William Kiser, Kiser Smith, Jeff
Smith and Snell Keller.
(New York Tribune)
The psychology of the opposition
to daylight saving is in many ways
curious. A correspondent wrote us
the other day a mother who com
plained that ''under v the new regime
her children didn't get enough sleep.
They couldn't, she insisted, go to
sleep while' there was still light in
the sky, but she mentioned in the
next breath the two-hour midday
nap which those same children had
just been taking, as usual, on their
sunny southern porch.
Do most mothers of children ob
ject to daylight saving? It is open
to doubt. Their annoyance, so far
as it goes, can best be explained by
reference to' the general rule that
new troubles are more vexatious
than those one has grown used to.
With daylight saving in effect
mothers have difficulty, for a month
or two in 'midsummer, in putting
their children to sleep in the early
evening, but the fact that they have
correspondingly less difficulty in
keeping them asleep in the early
morning is likely to go unnoticed.
However this may be, child speci
alists are apparently unanimous in
indorsing daylight saving as a
blessing to children, small and big,
and many mothers at
with them.

REDMON
MAN WHO CAN'T STOP
(Glasgow Times)
Cy. Burton, journeyman printer,
came to Glasgow Sunday "via the
brake beam. He hit The Times office
for "a sit" and rode out of town a
few days later on a cushion.
"Don't you get tired -of this life,"
we asked Cy, after he had recited
his experience in tramping sum
mer in the North and winter in the
South all over the country; then
he answered, "Yes, I do; but it's
--hard to quit. I blow here and then
there, and rarely ever stay anywhere
over two weeks. I often wish I could
stick on some of the steady jobs I
drift into."
Educated,. a shrewd judge of hu
man nature, and a splendid conver
sationalist, Burton is the rare type
of wanderer who scorns the title
"tramp printer" and calls himself a
journeyman. With a rule case, deft
fingers and creative brain, his stock
in trade, he drifts and drifts, with
nowhere his home.
And his like is passing fast. The
linotype barred him from the city
daily; automatic machinery is kill
inug him in the job shop and his
going is like the passing of a pleas
ant dream of the grand old days
when everything was tan& set, and
the corner saloon was the meeting
place after the -"stg;waJrupC,'
A message received in Paris,
Friday, told of the death at Warsaw,
North Coralina, of Horace Redmon,
aged forty, a former resident of
Paris, who had been engaged in the
tobacco business in that place for
several months.
Mr. Redmon- had been very ill
from the effects of an affection of
1 the throat, and for some time pre
ceding his death had been under the
care of a specialist at a Richmond,
Va., hospital, in the Jiope of obtain-
4ng relief. The disease made steady
progress, and Mr. Redmon was sent
back to his home at Warsaw, where
death came to his relief.
Mr. Redmon was a son of John
Redmon, of Paris, and had spent
practically all his life in Paris. In
late years he had been employed at
the Bourbon Tobacco Warehouse, in
this city, on the loose leaf sales
floors, and also at other points in
the same business in the city. Dur
ing the past summer he had been in
Warsaw, in the tobacco business in
which his father-in-law Mr. Draugh
ton, was engaged. While in Warsaw
he was married to Miss Draughton,
daughter of his employer. To this
union a child was born. After his
first season in Warsaw, Mr. and Mrs.
Redmon came to Paris and were
guests at the home of Squire and
Mrs. George Redmon, on Cypress
street.
Besides his widow and their little
son, Mr. Redmon is survived by his
father, John Redmon, of Lexington;
one brother, Emmett Redmon, of
Cincinnati, and one sister, Mrs. Jas:1
F. Lee, of Philadelphia, Pa. He waff
a nephew of Miss Imogene Redmon,"
Mrs. Edward Speakes and King"
Redmon, Mrs. Edward Speakes and

In accordance with the wishes of
Mrs. Redmon, the funeral and inter
ment took place at Warsaw, Satur
