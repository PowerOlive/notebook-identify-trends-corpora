Y.,Aug. 11, 1911, Dr. iiiehard E.V,(nDenbergr, and Leonard A. Warren, vt thatcity, were in Paris Satuday.At the time of the death of Mr.Chamberlain, valuable papers werefound which indicated that he left considerable property, consisting in partof real estate in New York valued at,$24,000. and personal property in cashamounting to $35,000. gIn the safe deposit vault in NewYork there was found much valuablejewelrv. diamonds, rubies and Dearls,also stock certificates in various corportions. Among his capers was found variousmemoranda showing that he was bornfn Bourbon county April 30, 1868. Hisfather was Richard Chamberlin and hismother was Kate Chenowitb. swVarious stories are told of his ilfe inKentucky, one concerning a murderthat he committed when he was aybung man. It is stated that the murder was committed in a saloon inwhich difficulty his brother participated. They were afterward arrested, butbroke jail and made their escape.Shortly before his death Chamberlainconfessed tu having also committedmurders in California and in AustraliaHis escape from Australia was saidto have been by rowboat at night. After drilting for several days -withoutfood or water he was picked up by asailing vessel and finally reached NewYork City, so the story goes.About ihe year 1900 he marriedNellie Barnes, a spiritualist, and theyconducted spiritualistic meetings inWest Twenty-third street, New YorkCity. During one of the scpances hiswife is said to have become insane andwas, for a time, confined in a sanitarium. She escaped from the sanitariumand was found in Richmond, Va.,where a few days later she committedsuicide by shooting.Upon investigation by the administrators and attprfieys it has been ascertained(tJjaOJellie Barnes was originally from California and owned considerable property there.Soon after the death of his wifeChamberlin spent his summers in Greencounty, New York and his winters inFlorida. The manner of his death wastragic. He was found dead in a boarding house in the Catskill mountains,Green county, from chloral hydrateDoisoning. The coroner conducted arigid investigation, but could not findsufficient motive to warrant arrest formmder.Papers and utensils found among hiseffects indicated that he was a professional analytical and pyrotechmcalchemist.As the laws of New York state provide that a diligent search be madefor heirs before a final settlement ofthe estate, the administrator and attorneys are making an investigation allthrough this Dart c f Kentucky in searchof heirs. If none is found within areasonable time, under the New Yorkstatutes the entire estate will escneateto the state of New York.There was considerable interestshown in the investigation made here.It was thought by many that Chamberlin might be one of the missineCurrent brothers, who killed ConstableWilliam Burton, of Paris, in 1873. TheCurrent brothers were arrested andfor greater safety were taken to theClark county jail, in Winchester.They were later tried and convicted,but brokp jail and made their escape,as was supposed to Texas. At thattime an effort was made to have theGovernor of Kentucky offer a rewardfor their capture, but ho refused, andlittle or no effort was made to apprehend them.'Mavor Hinton Ready to AnnounceThat Mayor J; T.,Hinton is holdinghimself in readiness to announce hiscandidacy for the Democratic nomination as the c:ty's chief executive, atthe first appearance of opposition isevidenced by his attitude' at presentand the activities maintained duringthe past few weeks."There has never been a time" saidthe Mayor last night "since I begandabbling in politics that the prospectsfor securing the endorsement of theDemocrats of the city has been sobright.

The relief promieedby the Democratic party for the terrible pressure of the costs of the necessities of life seems to be at hand.oOnly experience will reveal the fullbenefit to the people of the income taxThe annual saving over the counters ofthe nation's grocery stores, butchershops and clothing emporiums is expected ultimately to reach $500,000,000Some of the more sanguine regardeven this estimate as too conservative.The saving may reach $600,000,000, oreven m rc.The estimate is reached j'n'this'way :From British income tax exnenencetables, the experts figure that the annual revenue,.to be derived from income taxation under the terms of the.pending bill will be from 80,000,000to $100,000,000. In writing the newtariff rates the Ways and Means Committee has taken cognizance of thisprobable revenue and has lopped offduties on necessities which . under thepresent Payne-Aldrich law aggregate$50,000,000 annually. This: S50,000,000, nowlpaid by the people in the costoQIiving, ia to be paidfaut of the income tax revenue.But every dollar saved in tariffamounts to five or six dollars in thefinal retail prices paid by the consumer. This isjbcause the many middlemen who handle an article from thej stage of raw material .to Jthat of fin-icueu iJiuuuuL assesses as pront a certain percentage of "the value of thecommodity he handles. But in assessing this profit he includes the tariff inthe value of the commodity. Thus thepeople pay not only the tariff, but aisopay profits on the tariff. Every dollarof increased pneeor.the raw materialasseased by tariff becomesg five or sixdollars by the.time it reaches the consumer.Representative Cardelf Hull, of Tennessee, the member of the Ways andMeans Committee, who Jdrew the income tax provision, prophetically seesthe day when all government revenuewill be derived from just two principalforms of taxation the income tax andthe inheritance tax.The estimate of the Ways andMeans Committee 'show vivdily howwealth has concentrated in this countryAlthough incomes of as low as $4,000per year will be subjected to taxation,yet less than one per cent, of rour totalpopulation is affected by the bill.The Democratic Tariff Bill, now rpending in Congress, proposes to takesome of the tax off of such articles aswoolens, cottons, suear, meat and lumber, ,and to make up for the loss of rev-fenue by taxing the incomes of fthewealthy.Under the Payne-Aldrich law thehats, coats and shirts of the massesare taxed almost 71 per cent., whilemen like John D. Rockefeller, havingan annual income of $50,000,'000 a year,have not been required to pay a singlepenny of taxation to the Naticnal Government on their swollen fortunes.; It goes without saving that theSugar Trust, the Woolen Trust, theLumber Trust, ana the Beef Trust willcondemn the new tariff bill as classlegislation. They were never heard tocomplain, however, of class legislationwhen it hits the other fellow.The masses of the people will produce the wealth, and by legislative advantage a few get possession of it,and now these few object to thetransfer to wealth of even the amountof taxation derived from the tariff onwoolens, cottons, sugar, meat and lumber, which are but a few of the several thousand items on which themasses are now paying a tax.Under the income tax provision thosehaving an income of more ;than $4,000must pay a tax ot one per cent, on hisinnome in excess of the exempted$4,000Luke McLuke SaysAppearances may be 'deceitful, butwe'll all take a chance on a Dretty girl.The trouser skirt with . two pocketsis the latest.

C. Graham of the MassachusettsAgricultural college. A dry mash iskept in hoppers before the hens atall times and a scratch feed is fednight and morning. The dry mash iscomposed of equal parts bran, wheatmiddlings, corn meal, finely groundoats, ground alfalfa and beef scraps,and the scratch feed of two partscracked corn, one part what and onepart oats, says the Farm and Home.The scratch feed is varied, depending somewhat uporTthe condition ofthe hens. If on examination they arefound too fat more oats and wheatand less corn are fed. Sometimes wefeed three parts of corn to "two partsof wheat at night and oats in themorning.At certain seasons of 'the year moregrain is fed at night in the litter thanthe hens will eat, so there will be someleft for them to work on early thenext morning. This is found to be avery satisfactory method. At timesoats are fed alone, for when the threeare mixed together the wheat andcorn are picked up first and the hensthat eat the fastest get very little ofthe oats.If it is desired to force the hens, inaddition to ihe dry mash and' grain,moisten some of the mash, getting itto a crumbly state and placing it introughs, what they will eat in 15 minutes. This is fed at? night Freshwater, oyster shell and grit are keptbefore the hens.

By this time the stain shouldbe gone. Rinse in several waters., Appropriate Decoration."Why do politicians wear high hatsand frock coats?" asked the personwho makes trivial inquiries.

MAYO.)TheThog louse Is a common parasiticpest on swine and one that requiresvigorous and patient treatment toeradicate. The hog louse is one ftfthe largest of the lice that attacksdomestic animals. They are readilyseen traveling about on the bristles,usually on the neck, back of the ears,moving with a peculiar sliding motion. The eggs or "nits" are small,white, oval bodies attached to thebristles. Hog lice may be found onalmost any part of the animal's body,but are most common about the neck,ears and back of the elbow.These are blood-sucking parasitesand, by biting the hog and abstracting blood, they cause a good deal ofirritation of 'the skin. The animalrubs on posts and other objects andthe ccat looks rough and harsh. Theparasite and eggs are easily foundupon examination. The parasites aretransmitted from one- animal to another by contact, .or by contact withinfected bedding or quarters., Dipping the animals three or fourtimes at intervals of ten days will usually free them from these parasites,Vat for Dipping Hogs.provided the sleeping quarters arethoroughly cleaned and disinfected.In dipping to kill lice, the coal-tardips of the creoline type are betterthan lime and sulphur. If the hogwallows are kept well filled with water, to which some of the creolinedips are added every ten days, theswine will usually free themselvesfrom the lice. Another good way ofcombating the parasites is to tiegunnysacks or other coarse clothsaround. rubbing posts and keep thesecloths saturated with crude petroleum. There are many coal-tar "dips" onthe market. They are made from theproducts of the distillation of coal tarand have a variety of trade names.Creoline is one of these preparations.They are all dark-colored liquidswith a strong coal-tar odor and ,whenmixed with water form a milky whiteor slightly brownish emulsion. Wehave tried several kinds with excellent results. Practically all druggists have these dips, but we wouldadvise using a dip made by a wellknown and reliable firm. These dipsshould be used at the strength ofone part of the dip to forty or fiftyparts of water. If rain water is obtainable it is preferred to "hard" water. These dips should be used warm.There should be a dipping vat onevery hog farm. They may be madeof wood, galvanized iron or cement.They are set in the ground at a convenient place so" that there is goodsurface drainage away from the vatA good size for a large vat is ten feetlong on top, eight feet long on the bottom, and two feet wide on top. Theend where the hogs enter should beperpendicular and the other end inclined, with cleats, so that the hogscan emerge after swimming through.The entrance should be by a slide.Such a tank is very useful whereeverhogs are kept in numbers, as frequentdipping tends to keep the hogs healthyand free from parasites.Incubator No Miracle Worker.Do not expect your incubator, nomatter of what make or of what cost;to perform impossibilities. Then seethat your eggs to fill are fresh andhave been well handled. Eggs shouldbe from stock that is strong and vigorous, and free from disease. Onecannot expect good hatches from eggslaid by hens that have been weakened by roup or kindred troubles.Charcoal From Cobs.Charcoal is a health promoter forthe fowls.

J. WILDER.)Care should be taken to save forsettings only the eggs from the besthens. A very great difference canbe made in a flock in a few seasonsby the selection of the eggs for hatching. By chooBing the largest eggs thefowls will be much larger In size, butthere is a great probability that theywill not be good layers. The hen thatlays an unusually large egg is quitelikely to lay only every other day.By setting her eggs and again thenext season setting the largest eggs,you will develop a strain of largefowls that will lay very large eggs,but will lay only every other day, oreven less.On the other hand, if you set theeggs from the hens, that as pulletslaid during their first fall and winter, and continue to set eggs fromsuch hens, you will develop a strainof early winter layers.The eggs for settings should befrom 'year old hens, as the chicks willbe larger and stronger than thosefrom pullet eggs. It is best to mateEvery Poultry Home Should HaveSome Convenience for ConfiningBroody Hens.cockerels instead of old cocks withthese hens, as the eggs are more aptto be fertile and there will be a larger percentage of pullets.Choose the medium sized, wellshaped eggs and be sure the shell isfirm and strong. A weak shell is sureto he broken, and, besides the loss ofthe egg itself, will likely ruin several of the other eggs in the nest andmay even teach the hen to break andeat them.Feed the hens a little air slackedlime in the mash to give the eggs agood strong shell. Be sure the lime Is iwell slacked and give two tablespoonfuls to 100 hens every day.Do not force the breeding stock foregg production. Feed them mostlywhole grain, wheat, oats, corn andbarley. Let the mash be a light feedand give them fresh sweet meatscraps twice a week.. Feed plenty of green food, unlessthe fowls have range whore they canfind it for themselves. Keep themsupplied with pure, clean drinking water and have charcoal, grit, oystershell and dry bone always beforethem.Don't forget a little salt in themash. It should always be salted asmuch as the same quantity of foodwould be for the table.The hens must be made to exerciseby scratching for their grain in thelitter. They must be healthy and ingood condition if you are to raisestrong, healthy chicks.A diseased condition of the hen istransmitted to the egg and will appear in the chick when hatched.Protection for Trees.. Some orchardists have been successful in protecting their trees bysmearing the trunks near the groundwith mixtures which are distastefulto rabbits. For this purpose whitewash, a mixture of glue and copperas,decoction of quassia chips and bloodor grease, have been used. Mechanical protection by means of somewrapping is more permanent and effective than any form of wash.Effect of Animal Husbandry.Live stock make it necessary todiversify crops and grow more cropsupon which there is a wider marginof profit. Animals also distribute labor, furnish employment in time ofbad weather, or when field work isnot possible.

Balzac. ' '4SkExperiments carried on with cattleshowed that cattle given plenty ofwater with their pasture containedmore moisture and less dry matterthan did the carcasses of cattle givenpasture but no additional moisture.It is a generally accepted principle offeeding that it costs more and moreto produce meat as the moisture decreases and the dry matter increases.From this we are able to deduce thefact that it costs less to grow thesteers that had plenty of water, andso made watery carcasses, than it didto grow the steers that had no waterother than that in their food and reproduced a dry carcass.What is true in the case of steerswould hold equally true in the caseof sheep. Sheep given plenty of waterwill produce mutton more cheaply.than will those deprived of it. Muscleexpansion will be more active in theone case than in the other, and thatis another reason why mutton production would be cheaper.There is considerable water in anyof the pasture crops that sheep eat,and they get still more moisture fromthe dew that collects on the grassblades in early morning and late evening; but from these two sources,while it gets enough water to keep italive, a sheep still does not getenough water to. keep it in the verybest growing condition nor to keepall its bodily processes going on. inthe most effective manner possible.There is not an organ in the bodythat can function properly withoutwater to aid ti. Being one of thechief constituents of blood, water iscarried to every part of the system,and not alone helps it in getting itsnourishment, but also in ridding it ofits impurities. It is obvious that alarge amount of water must be necessary to keep the sheep doing well.Enough is not gotten with the food,even in summer, and this amountshould be supplemented by all thatthe sheep will drink when given constant access to it.CULL OUT UNDESIRABLE HENSAll Fowls That Have Passed TheirTerm of Usefulness. Should BeMarketed at Once.It is always seasonable to cull outthe undesirable birds from a flock,says the Poultry Journal. All hensthat have passed their term of usefulness should be marketed. While culling should be continued throughoutthe entire year, the most heroic workshould be done in the fall. Whatwe call yearlings in poultry are thosewhich were hatched the year beforethe pullets. They are nearer twoyears old than one, and make excellent breeders. After breeding pickout of this flock such as are considered unprofitable. What we call thetwo-year-olds are the ones that aregoing into their second molt. Veryoften some excellent layers are foundamong these, and it pays to keep such,but at that age the closer we cull thebetter will be our .profits. This culling, however, can only be successfulby close watching. No matter howvaluable a hen may be, if she provesto be a feather puller or an egg eater,she, too, should be sent with the lotof culls to market.HOMEMADE LAWN ROLLERPractical and Substantial ImplementWill Keep Grass in Fine Shapeand Discourage Moles.Frequent rolling with a heavy rollerkeeps the lawn in fine shape and helpsto discourage moles from working init, says the Farm and Home. A practical and substantial roller for thispurpose may be made of cement withgaspipe axle and handle. It shouldweigh about 200 pounds and shouldHome-Made Lawn Roller.be about two feet long. A piece of15-inch salt-glazed sewer tile makesa good form. Forms can also bemade of wood from narrow slats orgalvanized iron. In the latter casethe form may be left on the roller.Do Not Feed Moldy Corn.Moldy corn will produce blind staggers in horses, and it should never befed to them. Every year there is considerable trouble with this disease inthe west, and in almost every casethe cause is moldy corn. If thiscorn does not produce blind staggers,it will tend to injure the physical condition of the animal. So don't feedI it, and be careful about pasturing thehorses in stalk fields where there ismoldy corn.Using More Brains.In live stock and dairying, brainsare more used today than brawn.: nCorn Alone Unprofitable.Hogs cannot be. raised profitably onI"TH llAnn -Dark Bay Horse, Weight 1,7000.Sired by Imported Gitter 58803Dam by Imparted Queen 41490$15.00 To InsureBUSTER B. is a coming three yearold and a young stallion of markedsize and condition.

MURPHY,Paris, Ky.BIG FACTOR IN INCUBATIONLack of Ventilation Given as Causefor Many Failures in ArtificiallyHatched Eggs.The question of the cause or causesof the lower hatching percentage thatcommonly characterizes artificial incubation when compared with resultsobtained when eggs are set underhens is a matter about which thereis considerable conjecture, but littledefinite knowledge. In connection withvarious theories that have been advanced and several experiments thathave been made, it is perhaps suggestive that investigators have recently inclined to the opinion that unsatisfactory results are probably duein greater measure than is generallysupposed to an excess of ventilation.Several authorities are mentionedin support of the. statement thatthere is a larger amount of carbon dioxide in the air surrounding theeggs that are naturally hatched thanin a well ventilated incubator, and thequestion is raised as to whether andto what extent it may be an essentialfactor in incubation.Willie's Advice."You'd better est slow," said Willieto the clergyman who was dining withthe family.

Then the Prosecuting Attorney made a motion thatthe court dismiss the case.Judge Kerr accordingly directed thatthe indictment dismissd and Dolan'sbondsmen released.in asking that the charge be dismissed Col. Allen said there had beenfive trials of the case and that a conviction had resulted in only one" case,that being a manslaughter verdict.Col. Allen said one of his chief reasons in asking for a dismissal was thatthe case had cost the Commonwealtha large amount of money and that itseemed impossible to Drocure a conviction. Col. Allen in asking Judge Kerr to- .dismiss the case against Dolan, said hewould have moved for a dismissal Ifollowing the last trial, but for thefact that the iurv broucrht in a verdint.of guilty and in view of that fact hedid not think that it was consistentto recomend a dismissal.
