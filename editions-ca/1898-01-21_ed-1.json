How
OUR OWN
SAWING UP A LOG
Planks Are Cut Into Shape
vasd8aiagrM

If I had known in the morning
How wearily all the day
The words unkind would trouble my mind
That I said when you wont away
I had been more careiul darling
Nor given ycu needless pain
But we vex our own vii look and tor6
We may never take back again
For though in the quiet evening
You may give me the kiss of peace
Yet it well might be that never for mo
The pain of the heart should cease
Eow many go forth at morning
Who never come home at night
And hearts have broken for harsh words
6poken
That sorrow can neer set right
We have careful thought for the stranger
And smiles for the some time guest
But oft for our own the bitter tone
Though we love our own the best
Ah lips with the curve impatient
All brow with the shade of scorn
Twere a cruel fate were the night too late
To undo the work of the morn

In a
Great Western Sawmill
W S Harwood contributes The
Story of a Pine Board to Nicholas
After telling of the cutting down of the
tree and its progress from the forest to
the mill Mr Harwood says
Up from the yellowish brown depths
of the slow moving river flowing so
steadily on its way to the sea comes a
huge dark brown thing with a shining
dripping coat It is our log entering
upon its last stage It passes at once up
a long incline called the slit a
trench of wood about eight inches deep
i rt rriApp vt r f hnnrn
by the levers of the carriage
When the log has been adjusted it
rapidly advances to the saw and in a
very few seconds its water soaked sides
have been trimmed by the sharp teeth
The carriage flies back to the starting
place with the swiftness of the wind
and it is enough to make one shudder to
see it go You expect every instant that
one of the men will be thrown off and
terribly injured They learn to balance
themselves however though there are
frequent accidents One instant of inat
tention on the part of the head sawyer
who regulates the speed of the carriage
by his lever would send the carriage
flying back to the end of the mill with
tremendous force and probably kill both
of the men One of the men on the car
riage called the setter fixes the
width of the board to be sawed on sig
nal from the head sawyer the other
man is the second sawyer
As I stood one day in one of these
mills watching the men flying forth
and back on the narrow carriage and
almost expecting that one or both of
them would be thrown off in the swift
ness of their flight I took out my watch
and timed ihem and I found that they
traeled c aL average on this little
railroad n t m than 20 ieet long
1Gb 000 feet a day or about 31 miles

THE KITTEN AND THE BEAR
How Pass Frightened Bruin Up a Tree
and Kept Hini There
Chris Burns the veteran first sergeant
of Troop D had a kitten which during
the summer camping of the troop at the
Lower Geyser basin made her home
within thesergeants tent Here curled
up on a pair of
fied the world in
particular When the latter approached
she would elevate every bristle on her
brave little back her eyes would glow
like live coals and her tail would swell
up threateningly If dogs approached
too near she would hiss and exhibit the
usual signs of hostility until the in
truders had vanished from her
borhood
One day when the camp was bathed
in sunshine and every soldier in camp
felt lazy an inquisitive black bear came
down the mountain side and whether
because he was in search of adventure
or because attracted by a savory smell
from the cooks fire began to walk
sures a short one in the rapidly dimin
ishing afternoon sunlight to get an im
pression of buildings and oiher dark ob
jects and another longer one after dark
to print in the gas and electric lights

At a meeting of the Worcester Anti

when he was a boy in Worcester a cate

Where is hell
Under the earth a place of darkness
Who live in hell
The devil his angels and bad men
What do they do in hell
They curse God and sin continually
Do you deserve to go to hell

A GOOD STORY
Poop
xm
MM I
n
The most desperate personalraot I
witnessed during the war was perform
ed by a Wisconsin cavalryman said
O J Hilton of Madison Itwas at
Fleetwood Hill and the man discounted
army blankets she de- the capture made at Ciudad Rodrigo by
general and dogs in Charles OMalleys man Mickey Free
The Wisconsin man rode out between
two great cavalry forces Union and
Confederate and attacked a lieutenant
and two men belonging to Jeb Stuarts
force and after a hand to hand saber
fight lasting fully ten minutes cap
tured the three and brought them in It
neigh- was the prettiest fight of the kind I ever
saw and the Wisconsin trooper was
cheered by every man on our side who
witnessed his act and by some of Stu
arts riders I dont know who the man
was but my recollection is that he be
longed to the Second Wisconsin
A man who wore the Loyal Legion
button said he did not think the Second
about among the white tents of the Wisconsin was in the fight with Stuart
airy command at Brandy Station and Fleetwood Hill
Suddenly the kitten caught sight of He asked for the story however
him Dogs by the score she had seen I was a member of the Eighth New
but this particular dog was the York said Mr Hilton and our
gest and the hairiest dog she had ever ment was part of the cavalry command
seen But she did not hesitate It was sent under Pleasonton to look up Jeb
enough for her that an enemy had in- Stuart just before Gettysburg We
vaded her special domain Hissing forth found Stuart yellow sash black hat
her spite while her little body quivered plumes gold spurs and all that at
with rage she darted forth at the bear Brandy Station and with him were all
The onslaught was sudden and one his riders The fight was a hot one and
glance was enough for bruin With a we came very near being beautifully
snort of fear bruin made for the nearest whipped although we claimed the
tree a short distance awav and did not tory on the ground that we learned
and two feet wide at the top so hoi- pailSe until he was safely perched among what we wanted to know where
lowed out that the largest log will lie tke Upper branches Meanwhile the art was and what Lee was about Some
in it securely as it is being drawn up kitten stalked proudly about on the of the heaviest fighting of the day was
the incline by the stout chains with j gromia beneath keeping close guard at a spot called Fleetwood Hill and it
which the slit is equipped Projecting I over ner jUge captive her back still was there that the Wisconsin trooper
pieces ot steel on tnis cnain serve to cnrvea jnt0 a bow and her hair still
keep the log steady its great weight bristling with righteous indignation
causing it to sink upon these pieces of j wujie her tail would now and then give
bitjoi wuum mo nu bjjuip teotu a j a ginrmticant little wave as it to say
workman standing at the side of the
slit by means of a lever throws up two
powerful steel pointed arms which lift
the logs out of the slit and throw them
upon tables from which they are rolled
down to the carriage which leads to the
saws When the log reaches the car
riage it is thrown upon the frame rk
by the nigger along ratchete
bcr or piece of steel This f ramew is
like a section of an ordinary fiat car
running on a regular railroad track
Two men stand on the moving carriage
and at a signal from the head sawyer
Thats the way I settle impertinent
bears
The soldiers who meanwhile had
poured forth from their tents could
scarcely believe their eyes but there
was the bear in the tree and the kitten
belowT and there were those who had
seen the affair from beginning to end
And perhaps the strangest part of it
all was that the bear would not stir
from his safe position in the branches
until the kitten had been persuaded to
leave her huge enemy a clear means of
retreat Then he slid shamefacedly
who directs the cutting of the log j down from his perch and ambled hastily
off toward

NAMES OF PEARLS
About Five Thousand Small Ones Can Be
Boucht For Nine Dollars
Pearls are named according to their
size The very large are called paragon
pearls when the size of a cherry cher
ry pearls medium are called piece
pearls smallest dust pearls The oval
and long are termed pear pearls while
badly formed specimens are known as
baroques The value of pearls varies of
course with the quality and general
colors but the piece seed and dust
pearls always have a market price
The cherry and paragon are sold on
an entirely different basis If many fine
ones are on the market at a time they
may be had at reasonable rates Some
years they bring almost any price
The last two years especially the deal
ers say there has been a great scarcity
of fine pearls although there is no fall
ing off in the supply of the small stuff
When a pearl exceeds one carat in
weight it is sold separately Under
that weight they are sold in parcels and
bcrsrae less valuable as they become
umi The ssjsallcfft i als col
lected average abbtit 5 GO tthe troy
ounce and are rated at about 9 per
ounce If on the contrary one paragon
weighing an ounce or 150 carats was
on sale it would bring any amount
from 30000 to 200000 according to
quality Philadelphia Times
Hott to Take Moonlight Photographs
Moonlight effects in photographs have
long been admired by the uninitiated
and ftilly appreciated by both amateur
and professional photographers for their
beauty and many plates too have been
spoiled by snap shotters who have accept
ed moonlight as the real illuminator of
these views and accordingly focused di
rectly on this beautiful orb of night
Moonlights with the moon herself in
evidence are really sun photographs
that is pictures taken with a rapid ex
posure the camera pointed toward the
sun generallyin the late afternoon or
early morning and with clouds between
the lens and the direct rays
Many charming so called night pic
tures are taken by making two expo

tongs for two or three hours when
there came one of those let ups you all
have seen for all the world like two
bulldogs looking for a fresh hold While
both sides were waiting for the order to
advance a Confederate lieutenant and
two men rode out from their tents
moving toward us as if searching for
something on the field Everybody on
our side watched them and wondered
wThat they were looking for The two
lines were fully two thirds of a mile
apart and the three had got about a
third of the way across toward us
Then over on the right of our line was
a stir and commotion and the excite
ment spread along until it reached us
The right of our line was concealed
from us by a little grove of oak trees
A trooper in blue mounted on a big bay
that looked and carried himself like a
thoroughbred was riding out to meet
those three men in gray He sat on his
horse like a riding school master- When
within 100 yards of Stuarts three men
he halted saluted with his saber and
dropped his carbine and revolver The
three men from the other side had been
watching him and understanding the
challenge dropped their arms
Then came the fight It was a saber
contest with three against Onelf That
Wisconsin man disarmed that lieuten
ant in two passes hamstrung the horse
of another and put his blade through
the shoulder of the third He brought
the three into our lines

will advance money to a gambler The
betting man who has staked his last
shilling and lost it is pronounced a fool
and has put himself beyond the reach
of practical compassion The sharper
who has fleeced him has neither grati
tude nor pity He uses his victim as the
butt of his ridicule And the victim
himself who has risked his money on
mere chance or on baseless information
or on fraudulent representations freeiy
pronounces himself a fool judging him
self in the light of the issue To fancy
that we shall be exceptions and win
where others have lost that we shall be
the solitary lucky ones among the thou
sands unlucky is a folly to which we
are all liable but it is none the less a
folly
It is stated that tho winnings of the
table or bank at Monte Carlo last year
amounted to 800000 that is to say
this was the net sum lost by those who
played Yet each gambler who stakes
his little pile fancies he will be the one
to win There are some thousands of
bookmakers in our own country Out of
whose pockets do they pick so comfort
able a living Out of the pockets of
their dupes who so bountifully contrib
ute to the maintenance of their worst
enemies Good Words
The Word Toast
The word toast used for describ
ing the proposal of a health in an after
dinner speech dates back to mediayval
times when the loving cup was still re
garded as in indispensable feature of
every banquet The cup would be filled
to the brim with wine or mead in the
center of vhich would be floating a
piece of toasted bread After putting his
lips thereto the host would pass the cup
to the guost of honor seated on his right
hand r the latter would i turn pass
it to his riht hand neigbU4 In this
