and consented to talkwith representatives of the press whowent out to the St Louis on a tugYou ask me he said how I likeAmerica and I answer you that I havealways liked and I may say lovedyour people but this war has beena duty with me and the men underme 1 knew that the American fleetclearly outclassed us but it was aquestion of fighting either inside oroutside the harbor I have manyfriends in America and have only thekindliest feelings for them but everyman has a duty to perform to his country and all Spaniards tried to performthat duty There has been much feeling in Spain and I want all Spain toknow the truth that every ship of mysquadron fought until the last andwhen we could do no more we surrendered1 have much interest to know theexact situation in Spain Capt Goodrich has treated us all as well as anyone could possibly be treated My officers have occupied quarters in the saloon and we can not complainA telegram was taken out to AdmCervera at half past 10 oclock Sunday night

oncehaving begun it would stop only withthe capitulation of the city Thetown it is now said at the wardepartment is completely investedand for the beleaguered garrison thereis no possibility of escape This doesnot mean that the Spanish soldierymust stand still within the walls andbe shot down like sheep It is not impossible that like the brave and rackless Cervera they mayfVbe lead out to3ttack the American forces on thesurrounding hills This would be aforlorn hope but it would offer achance of striking the American linein a weak spot breaking it and turning back one of the flanks It wouldmean destruction in the end for theSpaniards of course but it would givethem one last grand dash with theglory of dying in hand-to-hand conflictThe bombardment began about 5oclock Earlier in the afternoon adispatch was received from Gen Shafter saying that Col Toral had declined the terms of unconditionalsurrender and that the bombardmentwould begin as soon after 4 oclockas possible At 11 oclock Sundaynight nothing further had been received at the war department and theanxiety for news from the scene of operations was intense Toral is secondin command of the Spanish troopsand it is presumed he replied toShaffers demand because Gen Linareswas so seriously wounded as to be inincapable of dutyGen Shafter the war departmentsays has in place 40 3 1 inch guns andeight 7 inch mortars With the

thecourage and bravery of his crewWe have been Co days in a Spanishprison said Mr nobson and themore I think about it the more marvelous it seems that we are aliveIt was about 3 oclock in the morning when the Merrimae entered thenarrow channel and steamed in underthe guns of Morro castle The stillness of death prevailed It was sodark that we could scarcely see theheadland We had planned to dropour starboard anchor at a certainpoint to the right of the channel reverse our engines and then swing theMerrimae around sinking her directlyacross the channelThis plan was adhered to but circumstances rendered its execution impossible When the Merrimae pokedher nose into the channel our troublescommenced The deadly silence wasbroken by the wash of a small boatapproaching us from the shore Imade her out the picket boatShe ran close up under the stern ofthe Merrimae and fired several shotsfrom which seemed to be threepounder guns The Merrimaes rudder was carried away by this fireThat is why the collier was not sunkacross the channelWe did not discover the loss of therudder until Murphy cast anchor Wethen found that the Merrimae wouldnot answer to the helm and were compelled to make the best of the situationThe run up the channel was veryexciting The picket boat had giventhe alarm and in a moment the gunsof the Vizcaya the Almirante Oquendoand of the shore batteries were turnedupon usSubmarine mines and torpedoesalso were exploded all about us adding to the excitement The mines didno damage although we could hearrumbling and could feel the ship trembleWe were running without lightsand only the darkness saved us from utter destruction When the ship wasin the desired position and we foundthat xhe rudder was gone I called themen on deck While they were launching the Catamaran I touched off theexplosivesAt the same moment two torpedoesfired by the Reina Mercedes struck theMerrimae amidships I can not saywhether our own explosives or theSpanish torpedoes did the work butthe Merrimae was lifted out of the water and almost rent asunderAs she settled down we scrambledoverboard and cut away the catamaran A great cheer went up from theforts and war ships as the hull of thecollier foundered the Spaniards thinking the Merrimae was an Americanwar shipWe attempted to get out of theharbor on the Catamaran but a strongtide was running and daylight foundus still struggling in the water Thenfor the first time the Spaniards saw usand a boat from the Reina Mercedespicked us up It then was shortlyafter 5 oclock in the morning and wehad been in the water more than anhour We were taken aboard theReina Mercedes and later were sentto Morro CastleIn Morro we were confined in cellsin the inner side of the fortress andwere there the first day the fleet bombarded

alarm partly to rest Silver andthe sick folk the whole party sat downas soon as they had gained the brow ofthe ascentThe plateau being- somewhat tiltedtoward the west this spot on whichwe had paused commanded a wide prospect on either hand Before us overthe tree tops we beheld the Cape of theWoods fringed with surf behind wenot only looked down upon the anchorage and Skeleton island but saw clearacross the spit and the eastern lowlands a great field of open sea iiponthe east Sheer above us rose the Spyglass here dotted with single pinesthereblack with precipices There was nosound but that of the distant breakersmounting from all round and the chirpof countless insects in the brush Neta man not a sail upon the sea the verylargeness of the view increased thesense of solitudeSilver as he sat took certain bearings with his coinpassThere are three tall trees saidhe about in the right line from Skeleton island Spy glass shoulder I takeit means that lower pint there Itsoiiilds play

this train of thcugndthey had spoken lower and lower andthey had almost got to whisperiug bynow so that the sound of their talkhardly interrupted the silence of thewood All of a sudden put of the midUe br the trees in front of us a thinhigh trembling voice struck up thewell known air and wordsFifteen men on the dead mans chestYo-ho-ho and a bottle of rumI never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates The colorwent from their six faces like enchantment some leaped to their feet someclawed hold of others Morgan groveledon the groundIts Flint by cried MerryThe song had stopped as suddenly asit began broken off you would havesaid in the middle of a note as thoughsome one had laid his hand upon thesingers mouth Coming so far throughthe clear sunny atmosphere among

go about Thisis a rum start and 1 cant name theoice but its some one skylarkingsome one thats flesh and blood andjou may lay to thatHis courage had ccme back as hepokc and some of the color to his

broughtup had Dick before he came to seaand fell among bad companionsStill Silver was unconquered I couldhear his teeth rattle in his head but hehad not yet surrenderedNobody in this here island

his life and by thepowers Ill face him dead Theres700000 not a quarter of a mile fromhere When did ever a gentleman ofortune show his stern to that muchdollars for a boozy old seaman with ablue mug and hiin dead tooBut there was no sign of reawakeningcourage in his followers rather indeed of growing terror at the irreverence of his wordsBelay there John said MerryDont you cross a sperritAnd the rest were all too terrified toreply They would have run awayseverally had1 they dared but fear keptthem together and kept them close byJohn as if his daring helped themHe on his part -had pretty well

like to know That aintin natur surelyThis argument seemed weak enoughto me But you can never tell what willaffect the superstitious and to mywonder George Merry was greatly relievedWell thats so he said Youve ahead upon your shoulders John andno mistake Bout ship mates Thishere crew is on the wrong tack I do believe And come to think on it it waslike Flints voice I grant you but notjust so clear

itnow asked Dick Ben Gunns nothere in the Tjody any moren FlintBut the older hands greeted this remark with scorn Why nobody mindsBen Gunn cried Merry dead or alivenobody minds himIt was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the naturalcolor had revived in their faces Soonthey were chatting together with intervals of listening and not long afterhearing no further sound they shouldered the tools and set forth againMerrv walking first with Silvers compass to keep them on the right linewith Skeleton island He had said the Itruth dead or alive nobody mindedBen GunnDick alone still held his Bible andlooked around him as he went withfearful glances but he found no snnpathy and Silver even joked him on hisprecautionsI told you said he I told vou vouhad spiled your Bible If it aint nogood to swear by what do you supposea sperrit would give for it Not thatand he snapped his big fingers haltinga moment on his crutchBut Dick was not to be comfortedindeed it wajjsoon plain to me thatthe lad Was falling sick hastened hyheat exhaustion and the shock of hisalarm the fever predicted by Dr Liyesey was eidently growing swiftlyhigherIt was fine open walking here uponthe summit our wav lay a little downhill for as I have said the plateautilted toward the west The pinesgreat and small grew wide apart andeven between the chimps of nutmegand azalea wide open spaces baked inthe hot sunshine Striking as we didpretty near northwest across theisland we drew on the one hand evernearer under the shoulders of the Spyglass and on the other looked everwider over that western bay

thatwhole lifetime of extravagance andpleasure that lay waiting there foreach of themSilver hobblvd gruntimi on hiscrutch his nostrils stood out and quivered he cursed like a madman whenthe flies settled on his hot and shinycountenance lie plucked furiously atthe line that held me to him and fromtime to time turned his eyes upon mewith a deadly look Certainly he tookno pains to hide his thoughts and certainly I read them like print In theimmediate nearness of the gold allelse had been forgotten his promiseand the doctors warning were boththings of the past and I could notdoubt that he hoped to seize upon thetreasure find and board the Ilispauiola under cover of night cut everyhonest throat about that island and sailaway as he had at first intended ladenwith crimes and richesShaken as I was with these alarmsit was hard for me to keep up with therapid pace of the treasure huntersNow and again I tumbled and it was1 then that Silver plucked so roughly atthe- rope and launched at me his murderous glances Dick who had droppedbehind us and now brought up therear was babbling to himself bothprayers and curses as his fever keptrising 1his also added to my wretchedness and to crown all I was hauntedby the thought of the tragedy that TiadN v1 liSvawTonce been acted on that plateau whenthat ungodly buccaneer with the blueface he who had died at Savannahsinging and shouting for drink hadthere with his own hand cut downhis six accomplices This grove that wasnow so peaceful must then have rungwith cries I thought and even withthe thought I could believe I heard itringing stillWe were now at the margin of thethicketHuzza mates altogether shoutedMerry and the foremost broke into arunAnd suddenly not ten yards furtherwe beheld them stop A low cry aroseSilver doubled his pace digging awaywith the foot xf his crutch like onepossessed and next moment he and Ihad come also to a dead haltBefore us was a great excavationnot very recent for the sides had fallenin and grass had sprouted on the bottom In this were the shaft of a pickbroken in two and the boards of several packing cases strewn around Onone of these boards I saw branded witha hot iron the name Walrus thename of Flints shipAll was clear to probation Thecache had been found and rifled the700000 were goneCHAPTER XXXIIITHE FALL OF A CHIEFTAINThere never was such an overturn inthis world Each of these six men wasas though he had been struck Butwith Silver the blow passed almost instantly Every thought of his soulhad been set full stretch like a raceron that money well he was brought upin a single second dead and he kept hishead found his temper and changedhis plan before the others had had timeto realize the disappointmentJim he whispered take that andstand by for troubleAnd he passed me a double barreledpistolAt the same time he began quietlymoving northward and in a few stepshad put the hollow between us twoand the other five Then he looked at meand nodded as much as to say Heris a narrow corner as indeed Ithought it was His looks were nowquite friendly and I was so revoltedat these constant changes that I couldnot forbear whispering So youvechanged sides againThere

sidefrom Sil erWell there we stood two on oneside five on the other the pit betweenus and nobody screwed up high enoughto offer the first blow Silver nevermoved he watched them very uprighton his

announced that she had found that forwhich she had risked her life ThePolish guards watched her movementswith something like awe as she stoopedand tenderly wrapped the mutilatedform of the dead woman in a cloak andbegan to drag it away Suddenly thegiiC paused and seized a heavy cartridgebox that lay in her path with an energythat seemed almost supernatural Herfrail delicate form swayed and

Will have considerable forces Monday enough tocompletely block all the roads on thenorthwest I am quite wellSiiaftekThe news of the bombardment cameat the close of a busy Sunday in thewar department Previous to the receipt of this dispatch the secretary ofwar had heard twice from Gen Shafter In the early morning came a telegram saying that he had ridden overthe American lines and was gratifiedat their condition A second dispatchreported that the lines were impregnable thus removing any fear of a successful sortie by the Spanish troopsshould a maneuver of this kind be attempted Both telegrams which emphasized the fact that Gen Shattersphysical condition had greatly improved were promptly shown to thepresident and occasioned him considerable gratification When questioned as to whether he believed thatthere had been a bombardment of thecity Gen Corbin replied You knowas much about it as I do I have keptnothing back I should sav howeverthat the firing Sunday was but thepreliminary to the more serious business of Monday This being the casethe attempt to take the city will probably be made MondaUefori Santiago July 9 via PortAntonio and Kingston Jamaica July11 Everything on the

engineersby James W See Some of his othertalk on patents and invention whichappealed to manufacturers and lawyersrather than inventors were valuablebut need not be reproduced hereIdeas can be stolen from the originator said Mr See but there is no excuse for inventions being stolen Anidea is not an invention but is merelya- hoxeful conception of a possibilityThe invention is the possibility reducedtc form lanj men have ideas whichare mere visions and which never canbe given form by anj body other menhave ideas which they would be incapable of reducing to form themselves butwhich could be reduced to form byothers if the idea was disclosed Themere hint or idea is of no benefit to thepublic and is not the thing which thelaw seeks to reward The useful invention is the thing which is iccognizedIt is quite common when a meritorious inventor has got his patenit tohear numerous men say He stolethat from me when the fact was therewas nothing to steal no indention butmerely an ideaThe law rewards him who accomplishes something instead of himwho merely suggests the desirabilityof a certain accomplishment Regardless of who first conceives of the desirability of an invention he who actuallymakes the invention first is the one entitled to a reward The idea of an invention followed by occasional andhalf hearted attempts to reduce thething to the form of an invention willnot prevail against the meritorious inventor who though later to conceivethe idea or even borrow it is the firstto reach the goal of practical accomplishment which benefits the worldBut if an inventor has gone furtherthan the idea and has developed it intoan invention then the only way he canlose his rights 5s to keep it secret sothat he cannot prove that he had auyrights The originator of an inventionwho has reduced it to an actual usefulinvention and can prove that fact cannot be deprived of his rights A competing inventor may meet him in thepatent office witii an application or thecompeting invent or may actually get hispatent before the mieritorious inventorhas applied for his patent but if thefacts are susceptible of proof the meritorous inventor afiter proper interference proceedings will be adjudged hisrights and will get his patent and thepatent cf his competitor will be practically void X V TribunespaniseTmoney itchAn Instance Which Shows Itslenee Dnrinjy the Civil

GonntricHIn a recent address before the IlionN Y board of trade Hon RobertMacKinnon gave an account of what hehad observed abroad and particularlyin Scotland in connection -with the careand repair of roads lie said I rodea great many miles over and around thehills through this exceedingly interesting country Scotland does not begin tobe as wealthy a coiimtry as the state ofNew York but everywhere through thisromantic hilly country the roads werea joy to everyone who had the pleasantexperience of traveling over them andknows how muehUhey add to the ideality and beauty of the countryHow do they get these results youinquire In the first place no farmeris allowed to work on the road Hespends his time to better advantagetaking care of his farm In the nextplace no dirt is put on the road but dirtis taken off the read In the next placenot a loot of road is built or repaired under irresponsible management everymile of the road being under thecontrolof an inspector orengineer as we wouldcall him in this countryThe keeping of roads is let- by con-AN IDkAL ROADLancaster Pike Between Philadelphiaand Lancaster Patract at a public letting The inspectoradvertises for bids on so many miles ofroad The roads are called by namessuch as the Little Palls road the Herkimer road or the llion road and everybidder of course knows which road heis bidding on Every mile or so alongthese roads there is a little square placemade in the fields adjoining and open tothe road about 15 b3 20 feet and whenthe crops are all taken in and theground will allow it the contractor goesinto the fields with a single horse andcartI do not remember in all Scotland orEngland of seeing a farm conveyancedrawn by more than one horse Onehorse there draws more than two horses3iere because of the condition of theroads The contractor picks up all thecobble stones and loose stones in thefield and carries them to his squareWhen the spring comes theytake these stones and break them intocrush stone and make what they callroad metal In the meantime in thespring of the year they see that the gut1ers at the side of the road are keptopen that- the water is properly drawnoff that the weeds are kept cut downand mud if any collects on the road isseraped off When the rainy or wetteason comes in thefall of the year thenthe road metal is drawn in a one horsewagon and put carefully on the road inplaces where it is needed and it is gradually worn into position 03 the travel onthe road so that when the followingspring comes it is worn into positionand is as smooth as a floorThey are however improving orpthissystem and theytcarefully save the dirtwhich wears away from the stone uponthe road and put it in piles and then inthe fall they put the broken stone onand cover it with this loose dirt and runa roller over it and put it in place whichvery materially expedites the repairingof the roads Ail the stone that I sawused upon the roads seemed to be a limestone something off the character usedin the village of Mohawk and I am convinced that rt is much easier to keep asmooth and perfect -surface out of limestone than from the stone around LittleFalls This stone however I thinkwears somewhat longer than the lime-stone does I think sometimes that ailittle mixture of our hard gneiss rockand the limestone would make a muchbetter road than by simply using ourrock aloneWe have in this example of theeareof foreign roads the very opposite principle from that adopted and in vogue inthe state of New York Our system results in loss io the farmer in more thana financial way It is a loss to him socially spiritually and intellectually Itlargely destroys every comfort of living in the country and is a detriment tohim in every way If I did not believethat the people in the country could bebettered by good roads I would neverhae had anything to say on the subjectXeed Wider Tire HereThe town of Kockport Me has votedto exempt from taxation teams usingwide tires and it has been

all information as to how other nations havesolved the administrative problems thatperhaps will soon confront ourselvesAppreciation of this fact has caused MrRobert P Skinner the United Statesconsul at Marseilles to report and thestate department to print an interviewwhich he recently had with a Dutchofficial jus arrived after a long stay inTava That island has a population almost exactly like that of the Philippines They number some 15000000and practically all of them are denselyignorant and full of caste and religiousprejudices Yet Java has been a sourceof wealth and strength to Holland andthe net annual revenue is about 14000000 after pajing all expenses includingthe maintenance of an of 20000men to repress piracy and brigandageThere hae been occasional rebellionsbut none of them has involved any largepart of the colony The effort of thegovernment Is to educate anxl elevatethese people without however outraging their racial instincts To this endthe native sultans and chiefs are retained supplied with a gorgeous retinue and surrounded with at least theInsignia of power By securing theselittle monarchs on otherwise precariousthrones the paternal hand obtains inreturn faithful subserviency and the inconspicuous but all powerful master oithe situation rules and at the sametime sows the seeds of education andreformFor this policy the only alternative isslow extermination after the Spanishfashion We Dutchmen in Jiva saidthe consuls informant move like adrop of oil very -very slowly but allthe time and by and by when something is accomplished ithas come aboutso gradually that nobody knows how ithappened We pay the native priestswe support a large native police forceand Ave rule by the hands and mouthsof the natives but all the time wo haveour own people on guard and no important move is made without our consent Thus the people and their chiefsare contented and happy and we keepthem so by maintaining a conditionmore favorable than they could hope tomaintain themselves We encourage ahealthy morale by permitting nativeand European soldiery to marry and livetogether in families and we never senda Dutch official to the colonies unless he1s endowed with qualities likely to improve the condition of things All ourofficials must work and work hard Theprofitable side of the account is traceable to the operations of the Netherlands Trading
