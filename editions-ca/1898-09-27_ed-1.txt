was mainly recruited and that nota single death had occurred among themembers of that company This is asremarkable as it is precious and it is afact which ought to be stated and putupon record as a part of the testimonyupon which the public judgment ishereafter to be based The Second Kentucky was an admirable regiment composed of most excellent material Itwas the first regiment in camp and ithas been in but two camps at Lexington where it was organized and atChickauiauga We have nor the information as to how many deaths occurredamong the members of this regimentThere have been some very serious complaints made by some of its officers andprivates but the fact that in a companyso largeas Company I not a single deathhas secured indicates that the officersand men of that company must hayebeen above the average of officers andmen We desire to participate with thegood people of Bourbon county in gratef ul rejoicing at the return home of theseyoung sons and brothers We presumethat

mosquito to-break up the performance of one ofShakespeares greatest tragedies andturn it literally into a farce wouldyou Well sucu is the fact You remember Ned Buckley dont you Usedto be leading1 man in the Boston theater also with Booth and BarrettOne rather warm night in August 79Ised took a snap company out to atown in western Massachusetts to dcJulius Caesar It was not a sumptuous performance by any means butstill it was good enough for the audience Buckley played- Caesar and didit well If I am not mistaken FredBrayton was the Marc Antony It became so hot before the performancewas fairl3 begun that the windows inthe rear of the stage had to beopened It wa not very long beforethe stage was swarming with mosquitoes they being attracted no doubtby the strong light on the stage Buckley had on a pair of white tights andhe discovered at the last momentthat there were seveial small holes inHie legs So hr got a pieceof billiardchalk and whitened over the tightswhere they were burstWell the plav ran along smoothlyenough until the time came for MarcAntony to bury Caesar and not topraise him Poor Julius was lying onthe bier and just as Marc began theoration he felt the infernal little pestsgetting in their ta utilizing- workBuckley always declawd that theywere educated They pst picked outthe spots where he had sed the chalkHe stood the agony as Ung as he couldThen he began murderivghis tormentors Several times did Julius slap hisfimbs and every time he slapped hegrunted with lie kept slappinghis limbs and grunting all through theoration the audience shouting withlaughter all the while The audiencejust about knew the cause of thetrouble because they were doing someslaughtering on their own accountPuekiey stood the agony as long ashe could then he gave Antony a tipand the pration was cut remarkablyshort The audience was tickled immensely and insisted upon the actorgoing before the curtain severaltimes The moquitoe who made thehits went with tUem aid the performance was a farce for tht balance of theevening Every time that somebodybegan to act one of the auditors wouldbegin to laugh and everybody wouldjoin in the chorus WashingtonStarTHE SNARLING

in this worldly sphere aremore or less selfish wrapt in selfish-loves and given to day dreams of selfishpride well bred people though theymay not be able to conquer at leastconceal such selfishness under an exterior of agreeable manners Thehabit of snarling is one that growswith practice The peevish child becomes the peevish boy The habitformed in childhood is difficult toeradicate and unless the individualis possessed of that sterling good sensethat overcomes all such habits thopetulant boy becomes the chronicsnarler It is hardly possible to un tderrate the amount of small miserythat such a person can inflict Theman who has never learned the sweetness of a lfe of sacrifice for othersmay yet stifle his nature under an outward display of courtliness and thusassume a virtue if he has it

woman is worse The petulant peevish woman is always in a position to inflict her friends with herweakness of disposition Her sphere1s limited but unfortunately the misery she can inflict is not limited Thesnarling man goes into the world andis more or less chastened by the buffeting of the world but the woman remains at home and often assumes therole of a chronic invalid as an excuse- for peevishness She often considersherself an abused person the victim ofthe worlds neglectThe habit of petulance is one that iaeasily conquered in childhood A wisenever allows a child to exhibitpetulance

pains are taken in preparation of the soilThe corn should be cut off as soonas a sufficient maturity has beenreached If the weather is dry and thefodder is put up in reasonably sinajlshocks it can be cut as soon as thegrain begins to harden well or a partof the shock can be cut and put up andallowed to dry partly at least beforeputting up a full shock One advantage in putting up in small shocks isthat the corn will dry out quicker andcan be shocked and cribbed earlierthan if in large shocks But when 1 heland is to be sown to wheat it is generally best to put up the corn in goodsized shocks in order to save roomAVith a good corn harvester it is notso much work to put up the corn ingood sized shocks as when it is doneby haiid It is always an item to cutthe corn reasonably close to

excellent The best preparation for slopfrom the ordinary feed is a mixture ofground corn oats and linseed mealGrind two bushels of corn with one ofoats and add 20 pounds of linseed mealfor every 150 pounds of the mixture ofcorn and oats Soak the mixture aslong as possible without souring It isa mistake to feed haif soaked feedThe object of soaking feed is to makeit more palatable and digestibleGrinding the feed is- an imitation ofmastication therefore the finer it isground the better the imitation andsoaking the feed is an imitation of digestion The soaked feed should notbe so thick as to be lumpy neithershould it be thin enough to be wateryIt should not be so water that waterwill gather on the top of a pailfulafter standing awhile nor so thick asto stand up when thrown In

said with a young man who livesa little farther out than I do and I dontmind saying that he doesnt know whatcourtesy and gentlemanliness isWhat does he do inquired her bigbrother who doesnt think very much ofnew women anyway and is consequently opposed to his sister being in the world of businessIt isnt what he does she replied itswhat he doesnt do Time and again he haslet me stand up all the way

answeredThe fact that he is in possession of aseat went on the big brother of coursedoes not entitle him to it if a fellow clerk ofthe opposite sex happens to want it Andyet men in business will do those thingsWhy I know a girl who has twice the grievance you have in that lineWhats happened to her she askedMan there first and refused to give upwhen she came along he explained4Give up his seatNo
