Rheumatism
If the people generally knew the true
cause of Rheumatism there -would be
no such thing as liniments and lotions
for this painful and disabling disease
The fact is Rheumatism is a disordered
state of the blood it can be reached
therefore only through the blood But
all blood remedies cannot cure Rheuma
tism for it is an obstinate disease one
which requires a real blood remedy
something more than a mere tonic
Swifts Specific is the only real blood
remedy and promptly goes to the very
bottom of even the most obstinate case
Like all other blood diseases the
doctors are totally unable to cure Rheu
matism In fact the only remedies
which they prescribe are potash and
mercury and though temporary reliel
may result these remedies produce a
stiffness of joints and only intensify the
disease Those who have had experience
with Rheumatism know that it becomes
more severe each year
ill ill
The case of Mrs James Kell of 6ri
Ninth Street S E Washington D C
should convince everyone that it is
useless to expect doctors to cure Rheu
matism Under recent date she writes
A few months ago I had an attack of
Sciatic Rheumatism in its worst form
The pain was so intense that my ner
vous system was prostrated and I was
for a long time perfectly helpless The
attack was an unusually severe one
and my condition was regarded as
being very dangerous
I was attended by one of the most
able doctors of Washington City who is
also a member of the faculty of the
leading college here He told me to
continue his prescription and I would
get well After having it refilled twelve
times and receiving not the least bene
fit I declined to take it longer
Having heard SSS Swifts Spe
cific recommended for Rheumatisn
I decided almost in despair to give
it a trial After taking a few bot
tles I was able to hobble around on
crutches and very soon had -no need
at all for them for SSS cured me
sound and well All the distressing
pains have left me my appetite has
returned and I am happy to be again
restored to perfect health
SSS never disppoints for it is made
to cure these deep rooted diseases which
are beyond the reach of all other reme
dies It cures permanenty Rheumatism
Catarrh Cancer Scrofula Eczema and
all other blood diseases It is the only
blood remedy guaranteed

THE INQUISITIVE BOY
THE BOUKBON NEWS
I have a little boy of six
Who sets me quite a task
And often puts me in u fix
By quoations that bQj11 ask
What Iwdds the moon tip in the sky
Where does the sunshine go
Why does my baby brother cry
Are things he wants to know
Where does the gas go when put out
He asked me yesterday
The question filled my mind with doubt
I wondered what to say
If all the good people that die
Says he in heaven are crowned
Why dont they go up in the sky
Instead of in the ground
Who lights the stars up every night
And turns them out at dawn
What makes the snow so very white
Where is the new year born
Why have all negroes curly hair
What makes their skin so black
What makes awheel go round and where
Do old ducks get their quack
Why cant we see the wind at all
What makes the water wet
These and such questions daily fall
From the wee lips of my pet
Hes most embarrassing at times
Interrogating me
Yet when upon my knee he climbs
Im happy as can be I

A NOVELISTS BRIDE
The betrothal and marriage of Mme
Octave Feuillet is told by herself with
charming naivete and wit in Quelques
Amies de Ma Vie
I was nearly 19 years old My moth
er insisted that I must marry Every
week she presented a new aspirant but
when after each interview she asked
Does this one suit you I replied
No not this one
My father urged me also It was gen
erally during our horseback rides in the
country while we let our horses walk
along the pretty routes that he under
took my conversion
I know some one he said one day
who loves you and who this morning
has asked for your hand
Another Good heavens 1
Yes another but I hope you will
not rebel when you hear the name of
this one
Tell me my father who it is
It is your cousin Octave Feuillet
What my cousin Is it possible that
he loves me He hardly knows me liv
ing so far away I have perhaps danced
three times with him and that is all
Very well that is sufficient He de
sires you to become his wife He de
sires it ardently Your mother and I
would be in despair should you disap
point him with a refusal
My father let me have a little time
for reflection
Not too long answered my fa
ther and may God inspire you
God inspired me that same night to
think my cousin charming Again in
imagination I saw him at those three
balls where I had danced with him and
recalled his handsome figure and bear
ing his distinguished looking features
and his slightly haughty air
I remembered the grace with which
he bowed to a woman particularly to
my mother I recalled the words he had
spoken to the music of the orchestra
during the quadrilles words which did
not resemble in any way the trivial
phrases I was accustomed to hear He
talked as well as he wrote He had al
ready a great reputation among literary
persons and his novels and poems were
making a sensation in the world
And was it I who was destined to be
come the wife of this poet of this gen
tleman I could not believe in suCh good
fortune In accepting it I felt uneasy
It seemed to me impossible not to dis
appoint the accomplished being who
had deigned to choose me When I
thought of his worth I felt my own in
feriority I found myself provincial and
ignorant Nevertheless my father had
said that he loved me
He loved me in spite of all my de
ficiencies It remained for me to recom
pense him by working for self improve
ment After having devoted my thoughts
exclusively to him I turned in imagina
tion to the existence we would lead
We should doubtless live in Paris
this beautiful Paris which I had not
seen since the journey with the ladies
of No more visits to the tombs of
St Denis but presentations to the
friends of my husband and drives in
fiacres from museums to churches and
from churches to museums
And then the installation of our
apartment and the purchasing of ele
gant furniture which would make it
charming how beautiful did all these
dreams appear when I compared them
with the monotony of the present
The effect of all this was that I did
not sleep till morning
I shall never forget that evening when
my cousin came the first time as a
fiance We awaited him in my mothers
room My father walked up and down
giving me his arm My brothers were
on the staircase ready to fall on the
neck of the visitor
When I heard the bell ring whieh
caused commotion throughout the house
I was so agitated so troubled so nerv
ous over the new role assigned me
that losing all thought of -propriety
all desire to please my fiance I ran to
ward the window and enveloped myself
in the curtains
There 1 should have remained in
trenched behind these curtains a posi
tion which would have given mo confi
dence had not my father indignantly
unrolled me and thrown mo into the
arms of iy cousin who appeared a lit
tle surprised at this welcome
It is timidity said my motlrer in
a low voice at the same timo smooth
ing my ruffled hair She loes you I
am sure
This undignified reception did not
discourage my fiance Iic irade me
pretty speeches all the cvcii and
happy promises to which 1 listened

Tuesday
the day I was to leave the paternal
home and take in the presence ofGod
ray title as madame iJHni
i Midnight was the customary hourTfor
j marriages in our part of the country I
was in hopes of having the day tojsay
self but I was obliged to busy myself
in all sorts of wayjL to try for thgfst
time my weddingtgowii to arrange
flowers and so forth a-
Toward the end of the day whilefthe
last touches were being abided tmy
toilet Vfhtoire my maid who hadipeen
occupied in carrying different thingaito
my new home returned in consterna
tion saying that my oousin waalfnot
well and that they did not jqibw
whether the wedding could take place
Oh mon Dieu said my mother
Arid she ran to carry her puxiety into
the bosom of the united family They
took counsel together and two relatives
were sent as embassadors to the fiance
During this time my mother ran vfrom
room to room calling all the servants
ringing bells recommending calmness
and doing her utmost to deprive meiand
everybody else of it f
Finally the embassadors reappeared
He is coming He will be here in a
few moments they cried ascending
the stairs The indisposition has pass
ed away And they wiped their fore
heads as they spread the good newa
After an hours waiting the door
opened and my cousin entered the
room He was very pale but very hand
some and I felt proud to belong to him
I have been a little indisposed he
said giving me his hand but I -am
quite well now and I love you Tnis
I love you came like a whisper and
I felt myself growing pale and flushed
at the same time
The dinner was long and serious We
were surrounded by aged relatives My
grandmother Dubois did not break her
cold reserve except to say to the serv
ants Do not spoil my dress My hus
bands uncle a retired officer who sat
at my right had a stomach trouble and
ate nothing He spent his time in find
ing fault with the others because they
ate so much
My child he said to me do not
eat too much today It is not goodfor
you And I could easily believe it
Emotion closed my throat so complete
ly that not a cherry could have passed
it
While waiting for the departure for
church the men went to smoke ancHhe
women gathered around me like bees
Ah my dear said one the great
moment is at hand
Your dress is very beautiful said
another but dead white is not becom
ing to your complexion It makes you
look so dark How will you arrange
your veil Will it cover your hair
There are too many flowers in your
wreath said another Give me the
scissors and let me cut out some of
them
Harassed with this feminine enthusi
asm and this idle chatter I asked f or a
moments respite and flew to my own
little chamber It was almost empty
Nearly everything that belonged to me
had been carried away during the day
and taken to my future home The bed
alone remained and against the wall
between its muslin curtains my basin
of holy water I fell upon my knees
moistened my fingers in the sacred wa
ter then carrying them to my fore-

We set out for the mayors office
then we proceeded to the church A
fine rain was falling and the dampness
penetrated behind the glass of the car
riage windows I ascended the steps of
the cathedral shivering The harmoni
ous notes of the organ greeted me un
der the somber arches Clouds of incense
were wafted toward me The cure
standing under the great crucifix ad
dressed some remarks to me my M35B
bund placed upon my finger thesflered
ring and all was over Providence

Sense of Touch Wanting
One has heard of heartless women and
women without feeling but that a hu
man being can exist without any sense
of touch seems marvelous yet this is
claimed for Mrs Evartina Tardo a
young widow in the West Indies Phy
sicians who have known her case pro
nounce it a physiological freak She is
said to be wholly without feeling has
swallowed poison been shot bitten by
rattlesnakes received a puncture in her
heart from a doctors lance and had her
neck dislocated all without experienc
ing any pain Besides these experiments
she can without injury drink benzine
and light the gas at a hollow needle
which pierces her cheek This strange
assertion is backed by the word of phy
sicians of reputa As a child she was
bitten by a cobra and it is claimed that
her sensory nerves were paralvzed and
her system innoculated with poison
New York Tribune
A Royal Belie
At the recent German military ma
neuvers Emperor William on one occa
sion was smoking a cigarette when he
saw approaching the carriage contain
ing the empress of Austria and the
queen of Italy He at once threw away
i his cigarette and galloped off to meet
j them Like a horde of savages the crowd
of spectators threw themselves upon the
precious cigarette stump fighting for
its possession After a Homeric strug
gle a worthy peasant secured it Sev
eral Englishmen surrounded him and
he finally yielded up the imperial cig
arette covered with mud for several
pieces of good gold
