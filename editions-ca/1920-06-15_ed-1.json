"Mr. and Mrs.'R. L. Tarr. A good seconded
time was enjoyed by all present. A
-delightful lunch was served.
A meeting of the promoters of
the Millersburg Chautauqua was
"held Saturday night. Officers were
elected, also chairmen of the four
standing committees which, with
the officers constitute the Execu
live Committee. The chairman of
each of Ui3 four committees will
appoint committees to co-operate
with them. There will be a meet
ing of the Executive Committee in
a few days. We have a splendid
"program for this year, the best we
liave ever put on, and this is say
ing much, because all of our pro
gram have been good. Buy your
season tickets early. The Ticket
Committee will wait on you in a
few days. If possible, take the
number of tickets you desire, when
they call on you, as we are going
-to make an effort to sell all the
"tickets before the Chautauqua
v)pens. This is the only way we
can hope for success. In the past
we have always come out a little
behind. Let us all make an effort
to go over the top this year. In so
doing we will be able to perpetuate
the Chautauqua for years to come.
We are now looking forward to that
week of pleasure and profit Re
member the dates, beginning July
5th, closing July 10 th.
When the news was received
here late Saturday afternoon, that
the Bourbon County School Board
had turned down the proposition
made them by a committee repre
senting the citizens of Millersburg
lo release M. M. I. and accept a lot
offered them for the erection of the
High School building or $7,000 in
addition to what the Board was .to
pay for M. M. I. to be raised in
erecting a high school building on
any site the Board might agree, our
people were overwhelmed with dis
appointment. They assembled in a
mass meeting at the Farmers Bank,
about 8:00 p. m. Saturday. The
spacious lobby of the bank was
crowded with representative citi
zens who wanted to know the truth,
which -nas given out to us in the
meeting by Mr. W. D. Mclntyre,
chairman of the committee. The
crowd was asked to be as thought
ful as possible. There were no
denunciations. Several short talks
were made relative to iuiure steps
A motion was made,
and carried empowering
the same committee to ascertain the
best thing to be done and report at
a mass-meeting to be held in the
next few days. Whn the M. M. I.
was purchased by the County Board
from Col. and Mrs. C. M. Best it
was not generally known by the
people of this community that the
institution was for sale and when it
was learned that the Board had an
option on it, it was treated by some
with indifference, while others did
not believe that they would Fell or
the Board would buy when the time
came. When it was learned that
the M. M. I. had been sold, the pub
lic Avas stunned, and for t mite they
felt there was .nothing to do but let
it pass from us. As the annual
commencement drew near we began
to realize most forcibly what the
loss of 90 or 100 boys who were
citizens of the town meant lu
The citizens of Millersburg
have for a long time desired a oei
ter Graded School than we snov
have. There has been some little
difference as to the manner of con
ducting ttie High School, as o the

size of our district and as to wheth
er 01 not trucks should be used for
the purpose of conveying- country
children to school. This was all
settled last summer, before the 25
cent tax was voted, and when this
vote was taken there were but two
votes against it. .The School Board
purchased property for the purpose
of erecting suitable building and all
was harmonious. And the people as
a whole believed all misunder
standings were at an end. When
the mass meeting was called at M.
M. I. on the afternoon of June 4, it
was for the purpose of demonstrat
ing that Millersburg could support
three good schools. We realized
there was no reason why wp shoulo
have to part with the M. M. I. or
M. C, and at the same time a High
School building could be erected,
ana the ei tire citizenship of Millers
burg would give its support and co
operation. The $53,000 offered by
the citizens of Millersburg was to
be raised by private subscription.
Our people as a whole did not be
lieve the County Board would turn
down the proposition and in our
zeal and interest for the new High
School we lecommendcd to the
County Board, Prof. Ireland as
Principal of the school, who now
occupies the same position at
Frankfort. We wanted to see the
High School a pronounced success,
and if in the event the County
Board could not pay all the salary
demanded by Prof. Ireland the dif
ference would be paid by the citi
?ens of this community. Matters
have been delayed with Prof. Ire
land until he is now ready to re
consider and retract his proposition,
and if he were not ready with the
loss of M. M. I. He would not re
ceive the hearty support and co-operation
tendered him by our citi
zens an June 4, after the action of

take them out and use them over and

Association, Moline 111:
"I have been a constant user of
Coffield Tire Protectors for over a
year. Making one continuous trip of
twenty days from Mobile to North
ern Wisconsin during which time we
had intense beat. No difficulty was
experienced throughout the trip, no
punctures or blow-outs. Have had
no punctures since using them in
over a year. Frequently in chancing
a worn out tire I have found nails,
tacks and broken glass in the outer
casing.
Coffield Tire Protectors will end
your tire troubles."
