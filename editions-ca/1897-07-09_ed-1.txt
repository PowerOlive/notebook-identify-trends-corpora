Proper ThlnsrProf Lannelongue ti famous Frenchscientist and a collaborator of ProfCookes has invented 0 hamlet made ofstrontium glass for the purpose ofwarding off the suns X rays Althoughmost people do not realize it sunlightcontains a certain proportion of whatare called X rays If these are deflectedat a certain angle they will blister human flesh The causes of this deflectionare trivial in themselves but Prof Lannelongue claims that they are none theless powerful because of the resultsthey bring about He believes that it isthese X rays in the sunlight that bringabout what is known as sunstroke andthat if the proper means were taken todeflect them again such a thing as sunstroke would become almost unknownThe attention of this distinguishedsurgeon was first called to the peculiareffects of the suns rays by an incidentthat he witnessed He was watching anumber of children who were playingin a courtyard in the shadow of a wallthe top of which was in strong sunlightSuddenly several of the children begauto act in a most peculiar manner dancing around each with his hand on irishead crying out My head burnsProf Lannelongue at once went to theplace where the children were at playand examining their heads found blisters on the scalp of every one In tryingto account to himself for the phenomenon he wondered if tiie blisters hadbeen produced by X rays projected fromthe top of the wall He instituted in hislaboratory a series of experiments onseveral persons Some of these whenexposed to the action of the rays wereprotected by stronium glass and hesewere not at all injured Other personsexperimented upon who were not similarly xrtected were burneti ii thesame manner as the children had beenAfter carefully studjang this problemthe professor came to the conclusionthat his accidental observation of thechildren at play was likely to result ina revelation as to sunstroke its causeeffect and remedy He called to mindthe fact that among the ancient Greekssunstroke or anything correspondingthereto was unknown He also remembered that these same ancients coveredtheir heads with brass helmets andtheir chests and backs with cuiraases ofmetal that is known to have been of anature that is impervious to X raysIt was plain however that people couldnever be induced towear a helmqt madeof metal of sufficient density to proveopaque to the X rays and then thethought came to him that perhapsstrontiun glass would solve the problem Therefore he has determined tobegin the manufacture of glass helmetsas an absolute protection from thedeleterious effects of the rays of thesun on very warm days To this wd heis organizing a company and hofs before long to place quantities of it product upon the market N Y HeraldBRONZE OF THE LAKE DWELLERSMade

smaller knives were of finerworkmanship averaging about fiveinches in length very thin and nowafter having lain buried in the mud ofthe lake for 20 centuries or more stillhave fine cutting edgesThe javelin and spear heads resemblethose of Roman and Etruscan makeand perhaps many of them were forgedin Rome and wielded by the Romaninvaders of Helvetia The bronze fishhooks are almost identical in

from snow andfollows the wooded shores with redpainted railings on each side On oneside is a stand with seating room forseveral thousand people and a specialbox with tent hangings for the governor-generalsurmounited by the imperial eagle in gold In front of thisbox lower down you see the prizesconsisting of gold and silver cups vasesand ornamental pieces all in Russianstyle and tasteA bell rings the course is cleared bymounted gendarmes and now the competitors in due order take their placesin front of the stand but not side byside as they always start from oppositesides of the course with heads alsoturned in opposite directions The usualrace course hum and hoise of the betting men are heard and increase involume as the bell rings the secondtime They are off and the fascination of rapid motion open air andstrenuous exertion throws its spell overthe assembly high and low for trotting is certainly the most fashionableand beloved sport in Russia You cannot recognize people just yet thegreat fur collars are raised and reachover the fur caps leaving only redtipped noses beneath which appearnever missing cigarettes The ladiesheads are almost entirely covered bywoolen wraps so here again you canonly guess who is who To a strangernot investing his money in backing hisopinion as to winners the game mightseem monotonous ehoiigh as the horsesdo not finish side

method of procuringantitoxin for diphtheria and his experiments are described as highly successful He prepares his antitoxin orcurative serum by substituting diptheritic poison to electrical decomposition In this way he reduces its virulence to a point at which it can be safely injected into the blood of an animalThe animal thus treated is not only rendered immune to diphtheria but if already suffering from the disease iscured The new antitoxin can be prepared very quickly and it is said to bemuch more effective in its operationthan the older form which requires -weeksfor its preparation Dr Smirnow has not yet however experimentedupon human subjects his most imporant patients being dogs which of allanimals are said to be perhaps the mostsusceptible to diphtheria

She-was stirring- a small kettle of something on the stove and did notwant toleave it to burn1 just want you to look and seewhats coming in at our front gateMrs Log an took a corner of her apronfor a holder and lifted the kettle andits bubbling contents onto the backt piirt of the stove Then she joined Janetnf the window tall slenderwoman was entering the gateShe had a blue-and-white soiledsliam apron tied over her frowzy headand her chocolate colored calico dTessskirt was pinned up about her waistrevealing a black quilted petticoat ands pair of bine stockinged feet thrustinto a pair of gorgeous carpet slippersiso much too lavge for her that her walkshuffled to keep the slippers onIts Jane Wadlin said Mrs LoganI know it replied Janet But willyou tell me what she has in that bas-- kfctSure enough said Mrs Loganvaguely as she peered over the tops ofher spectaclesMrs Wadlin carried with apparenteffort an enormous clothes basket piledhigh with something covered over witha soiled tablecloth Thebasket which she held by either handlewass so heavy that it pulled her head- and shoulders forward and her facewas red and perspiring although itwas a cool Monday morning in late SeptemberTheres no telling what freak hasstruck Jane Wadlin now said Mrs Lo-AanBut she and Janet soon knew the nature of the freak that had struck theircaller that morning for in a moment ortwo the basket thumped up against the- kitchen door which Mrs Wadlin openedwithout the preliminary politeness ofknockingShe dropped the heavy basket to thefloor and sat down on its contents panting and wiping her red face with a corner of her soiled calico apronMy she gasped if I aint abouttuckered out Why Aint you washing to day Marthy LoganWe have a very light washing- thisweek anu l havent been in any hurrywbout beginning it replied Mrs Logan A jar or two of my cannedrasplierries had begun to work and Ithought Id cook em over again beforeT begun to wash Id just told JanetsheM better go down cellar and fetcht up the tubs and bring out what littlewash we haveThen Im just in time said MrsWadlin with satisfaction Ive g ot anawful big- wash this week and whileT was gathering it up a happy thoughtstruck me Cant you guess what itwasXo I dont know as I canWell it flashed across me Why-ant I gather up my dirty duds and goaver and wash with Marthy Logan andmake a sort of a frolic of it When IiJivnd over in Peakville a triend of minerutineel Mag Graves and me washed together every Monday of the world OneMonduj shed lug her things over tomy house and the next Pel lug mineover to hers and wed wash and visit-together It was a real neighborly wayof doing and wed awful good times-and it just flashed across me tins inarnMiig Why cant me and Marthy Logan- no that way and here I am with mywash to beg in it- ciMrs Logan looked aghast whileJanets face flushed with annoyancebut Jane Wadlins perceptions were notkeen enough to show her that she hadmade a mistakeI do love to be neighborly she saidas she got up and dragged the j ed andwhite tablecloth from the basket ofsoiled clothing Ill just seprate mycolored things from the white ones andthen we can pitch right in and wash andvisit at the same timeMrs Logan did not know what to door say She was a woman of a very mildand gentle spirit Her friends oftensaid that Martha Logan wouldnt hurtthe feelings of a fly She did not wantto hurt the feelings of Jane Wadlin andyet she felt that she could not enter intothe arrangement Mrs Wadlin had maderegarding the washingJanet was also of this opinion and yetboth mother and daughter felt that MrsWadlin was a woman who was not to beoffended with impunity She was agood friend and abitter enemyCome Janet said Jane Wadlin rundown cellar and get the tubs and wellpitch right in The neighbors will thinkwere awful slack if we dont get ourthings all out by ten oclockJanet glanced at hen mother MrsLogan struggled desperately but vainlyto invent some way of preventing whatshe regarded as little less than acalamityFinally she said weakly Yes Janetgo down and get the tubsJanets black eyes flashed and she wasabout to speak but Mrs Logan shookher head and Janet kept silent Whenshe reached the cellar she said angrilywith an angry stamp of her foot on thecellar floorWell of all the impudent performances As if we didnt have workenough of our own without doing anyof Mrs Wadlins Theres eight in herfamily and only three in ours and itsjust a scheme on her part to get mostof her washing done by some one elseBut itll be the last time shell bring herwashing here now see if it isntJanet repeated this resolve manytimes during the day and Mrs Loganmade a similar resolution Mrs Wadlinwasnotoriouslyslack and unsystematicin her methods of work and at intervals of about two hours she would suggest that they eat a bite and visit alittleIt was nearly the middle of the afternoon betore the Jasti of the coloredthings were flaunting from the line inthe Logan back yardAnd such a looking array of thingsas they are What will the neighborsthink said Janet as she stood at thewindow of her room tired and crossand looked at the rows of pink andpurple calico aprons and frocks belonging to the little Wadlins and the pairof huge blue overalls belonging to MrWadlin and the surprising array ofstockings in all sizes and colors belonging to different members of the WadlinfamilyBut Jane Wadlin was serenely happjNow we can have a good long visittogether while our things are dryingand then we can fetch them in anddampen em down and Ill have Wradlinjome over and get my things after supper I think itd be real nice if we couldiron together but I guess we cant because I always bake too on my ironingday But Ive enjoyed our washing together so much that I hope we can keepit up right along You and Janet willfetch your things and come and washwith me next Monday wont youYes indeed we will said Janet before Mrs Logan could give utterance tothe excuse she had intended makingWhen Mrs Wadlin had finally gonehome Mrs Logan saidWhy Janet what did you mean bytelling Mrs Wadlin that we would comeover and wash Avith her next MondayI simply cannot stand it to have JaneWadlin and here washings hereNor I replied Janet and ouy -washingat her house will end it all and atthe same time keep us from quarrelingwith Mrs Wadlin Trust me for thatmother Ive a scheme of my own inmind for putting an end to this unpleasant arrangementMrs Logan somewhat reluctantlyconsented to the carrying out of thisscheme when it was made known toherAlthough I dont feel sure that itwill affect Jane Wadlin as you think itwill she said to JanetIt was about eight oclock on the following Monday morning when Joe andJerry Hope the sons of one of MrsLogans neighbors appeared at MrsWadlins with an enormous clothesbasket piled high with soiled thingsof every sort Each boy carried a pillow slip full of things in addition tothose in the basketHeres a part of Mrs Logans washsaid Jerry as he and Joe deposited theirburdens on the floor of Mrs Wadlinsrather cramped kitchenShe and Janet said theyd be alongpretty soon with the rest of it said JoeThe rest said Mrs Wadlin in dismay as she looked at the great basketand the overflowing pillow slips Wellfor pitys sake I should think MarthyLcgan had gone to keeping a hotel oropened up a laundry irom the size ofher washThis conviction was deepened whena few minutes later Janet and MrsLogan appeared by way of the backstreets carrying another clothesbasket full of things and in additionto this Janet carried a market basketcontaining about a dozen -glass fruitjarsI know weve got a pretty big washing she said cheerily but therellfce three of us working together youknow and I guess well worry throughit And we thought wed put up abasket of peaches to day as theyve alot of fine ones extra cheap at Smithsfruit store He said hed send a basketup here by ten oclock for us and wecan do them while we visitYes I spose we can saidMrs

dfor all these thingsNo I dont suppose we can saidJanet but we can dry a good manythings here in the house and theresyour large front porch we can stretchlots of line on it and the rest of thethings we can spread on the grass andhang on the fenceMrs Wadlin was not a woman whocared particularly for looks but theidea of her front porch being used asa drying ground for clothes was farfrom agreeable to her Her face reddened and she bit her lip -when Janetpulled the sheet away from the contentsof one of the baskets and saidWe wash up all of our bed spreadsand blankets and curtains at this timeof the year and heres a basketful tobegin on Then my Grandmother Loganis falling into feeble health and mother and I intend doing all of her washinghereafter if she dont improve andweve quite a washing

you saidyou had been making Mrs WadlinWell if 1 dont call that cool saidMrs Wadlin when she was alone in thecellar getting a dish of her choice andlimited supply of peach preserve Andsuch a wash as theyve lugged in hereto say nothing of putting up a basket ofpeaches at the same timeAt nine ten and eleven oclock Janetproposed a bite to eat and when thebasket of peaches arrived she saidcoolly Xow Mrs Wadlin if youlljust finish this tub of bedclothes Illbegin on the peaches and well get alot done to dayJanets naturally orderly instinctsseemed to have forsaken her that dayand Mrs Wadlin did not greatly exaggerate the condition of her kitchenwhen she said to herself while hangingout the second line of clothesYou cant move in that kitchen without stepping on peach stones or peachparings and you cant get peach stainsout of anything And Janet Loganmust be as hungry natured as a goatthe way she wants to eat all the timeItll be five oclock before we get thiswash out and then the place will looklike it was a drying ground for thewhole town If this is what washingwith the Logans means I think I preferto wash alone hereafterIt was six oclock when Janet threwherself wearily into a big

Sometimes Seem to-There are those who say that theknowledge that the invader has noright to be there adds to the pleasureof trespass WTe doubt It greatly Butwe have no doubt at all that many animals are perfectly aware of the illegalside of trespass that they know thatit is naughty and disallowed and thatin doing so they are contravening therights of property This of course involves the supposition that animals understand property not only in thingsbut land There are many leadingcases to prove this the commonestbeing the vigor with which dogs driveany strange animal out of their masters garden Dogs are so well awareof the whole moral and legal aspectsof trespass that when once they havemade up their minds to it they actuallytrade on the knowledge that their owrier has a conscience though they havenotWe have noticed this in greatperfection in the case of canine trespass onthe grass circles in front of a semipublic building in London This delectable piece of grass is divided fromthe road by a high railing but thegate usually stands open Dogs passing with maids on their way to doshopping or with children out for awalk after some reconnoitering dashin and have delightful games on thesegrass plots with rolling over racingaround and general high jinks Themaids and children being shy are notlikely to trespass stand at the gatecall whistle and implore But thedogs go on just the same This is acommon form of dog trespass Itsmeaner side was painfully shown inthe following case Most well-brought-upsmall boys who are naturally muchtempted to trespass are so lectured andfrightened with stories of policementhat they are quite nervous on thesubjectOne such small boy attended by acollie dog was passing when the dogran in at the gate and being instantlyjoined by a friend proceeded to raceand play on the grass The good littleboy stood at the gate atid whistled tillthe tears ran down his cheeks withCHILDRENS VIEW OF WORKThey Delight in QccHFIons

that wehave performed it Why should we denythe child this natural gratification andsubstitute for it the doubtful bliss ofan everlasting play spell We must notsuppose that the child who is set tosome little task and told that he is playing is really deceived The infant mindis acute and divines much that -we suppose securely hidden from it All thatwe effect by our dramatization of workis to make labor distasteful by strenuously insisting that it is easy to do athing we set too high a premium uponease and make a slight hardship seeman unendurable burden Now I maintain that work is not a

Vice President Stevenson Interestert in the MorcmentAgitation for good roads is Vneetingthe cordial indorsement of public menwho stop to give it more than a passingthought Ex Vice President Adlai EStevenson is now among those whostrongly commend the movement ofHie League of American Wheelmen forbetter highways In a recent letter hesaidI am in full sympathy with the efforts now being made to secure goodroads throughout our country ThisIs a living- question There is little difficulty in getting from one large cityto another or even in crossing the continent but the important question ishow to get from the country home totie schoolhouse to the church to themarket It is a gratifying fact thatthis subject is now undergoing thorough discussion an imany of our statesThe result will be beneficial Likeother Important questions t will workout its own -solution I agree with GovM arkham that 4good roads mean adVimced civilizatioaJWhen people dike Mr Stevenson begin to emphasize the need of bettercountry highways surely there mustbe a great public interest to be subserved And what are the facts MrStevenson lives at J31oomington 111in the center -of zx district whose roadsore notoriously Ibad It is not the onlyihstrict of its kind There are dozensof such districts in every state in theunion The Bloomington district isonly a sample and should not be singled out as an illustration but for coincidence A prominent paper in Illinois recently published this interest-ing dispatch from its Bloomington correspondentThe embargo of mud is complete incentral Illinois Farmers who havelived in McLean county more than halfn century declare that they have neverseen the roads so utterly impassableas they are now General stagnationin retail trade is the result Farmersfind it impossible to come to town inn light vehicle drawn by four horsesMuch of the corn stored in cribs hasrotted on the cob and crumbles in thesheller The condition of grain is giving the farmers serious troubleAnother interesting piece of newscomes from Massachusetts In a townof about 5000 inhabitants in that statea dwelling house was burned to theground because the roads were toomuddy for the fire department to reachit Insurance men claim that the towncan be held responsible for the lossCOST OF BAD ROADSSome Figrnres Collected by tlie Dcnnrtnient of AgricultureAccording to statistics collected bythe office of road inquiry of the department of agriculture the amount ofloss each year by bad roads of thecountry is almost beyond belief Some0000 letters of inquiry were sent tointeliigrent and- reliable farmersthroughout the country and returnswere obtained from about 1200 counties giving the average length of haulfn miles from farms to markets andshipping points the average weight ofload hauled and the average length perton for the whole length of haul Summarized it appears that the generalaverage length of haul is 12 miles theweight of load for two horses 2000pounds and the average cost per tonper mile 23 cents or three dollars forthe entire loadAllowing conservative estimates fortonnage of all kinds carried over public roads the aggregate expense ofthis transportation is figured at 946414600 per annum Those in a positionto judge calculate that two thirds ornearly 631000000 could be saved ifthe roads were in reasonably good condition At 400 per mile a very goodroad can be constructed and if anamount equaling the savings of oneyear were applied to improving highwsys 157000 miles of road in this country could be put in condition Theeffect of this would be a permanent improvement and not only would thefanner be astonished in the sudden reduction in his road tax but he wouldalso wonder at tthe remarkable fallin off in the cost of transportationHe would also find that he requirediewer horses and less feed for themHe could make two trips to market aday instead of one when ability toget his goods ithere at a time when highprices are ruling is a matter of greatconsequence Farmers are beginningto apply a little simple arithmetic tosome of these matters and it is nottoo much to expect that in the near f ulure we shall see a decided revolutionin the

British show of goats washeld in 1875 under the patronage ofBaroness Burdett Coutts who ha3 alwaystaken interest in the matter In1S79 the British Goat society was organized with the object of improveing the breeds of goats and increasing their capabilities for milk production Under the auspices of that society flock books and a stud goat register are published at frequent intervals and classes are provided for goatsat the leading shows of the UnitedKingdom The points aimed for inbreeding were a fine smooth coat ofshort glossy hair horns if any smalldark colored and curving backwardwith large milk yield fixed as an established characteristic of the ewesGreat improvement has resulted notonly from careful selection aiuong native goats but also and to a still largerextent from the importation ofPRIZE TOGGENBURG GOATperior breeds One of the most successful breeds yet introduced is theToggenburg from Switzerland Thesegoats have many desirafole qualitiesThey are short haired nearly alwayshornless and are unsurpassed as milkers The accompanying illustrationportrays the Toggenburg goat SwissBeauty which took the second prizefor hornless goats at the last Britishdairy

JuddMICROSCOPIC LIFEBacteria Play an Important PartVvinthe Work of the DairyThe necessity of bacteriology indairy products was discussed by ProfMcDonnell of the Pennsylvania statacollege at the recent dairymens meeting As it was exceedmglj interesting I report a few of the salient points-The speaker- stated thatoulyifa fewyears ago physicians were the only persons who were thought to have any interest in this subject while the fact iswe are indebted to bacteria for verymany of the good things of life Bacteria come to us as friends and not aiways as enemies as was supposed a fewyears agoEvery delicac3r supplied to us is largely dependent upon bacteria We couldhave neither good butter nor cheesewithout them in fact nothing of adelicacy in the dairy can be had without bacteria except condensed milkwhich he did not regard as a delicacyThese bacteria all belong to the vegetable kingdom are of vegetable originand are of many different forms Somemove through liquids while others remain quiet 25000 of them can lie sideby side in an inch of space Some ofthe bacteria act only on dead matterwhile another class produces the acidof milk and others produce the aromaso very desirable in butter and also theflavorIf dairymen were careful to haveclean stables for their cows very manyundesirable bacteria could be keptfrom the milk and less trouble wouldresult It is not true as some seem tothink that the bacteria come from thecow with the milk If milk could bekept from coming in contact with theair which is filled with bacteria whilethe cow is being milked it could bekept pure for an indefinite periodGreat care should be taken to have allmilk vessels clean if the dairyman desires the best possible product Typhoidfever bacteria develop very rapidly inmilk and as a result the malady oftenspreads very rapidly Scalding milkkills all organisms George Spitler inOhio FarmerTinPISTOL CASE BEARERXew 0reliarl Pest Investigatedby Prof SliiiKcrIamlProf M V Slingeriand of

made byMark Twain in JRougkinglt saiditheNevada pioneer He did not say MarkTwain by the way but Sam Clemensthe name by which all old Nevadansand Calif ornians knew the famous humorist The pioneer was talking ofmen of his time who had died with theirboots on and Billy Mulligan was theor nnm wlin lnst TJOW Was to thefront Some of the hostile mix ups andshooting matches in which that youngIrishman had taken a hand had beenrelated and now the narrator had cometo the day of his taking offBilly Mulligan had run along stringand lasted a good while for a man of histemper and practices for he wastough out and out continued thepioneer His neck was in danger inthe days of the San Francisco vigilancecommittee and he ran some narrowchances with the law and lynchers afterward He was a brave desperate manhandy with weapons and would fightat the drop of the hat But he pulledthrough all trouble until the time camewhich seems sooner or later to befallalmost every desperodJo when the strainof danger and the effect of constantdrinking and excitement got the betterof his nerves and judgment When adesperado gets that way there are twocourses that he may take quit thecountry quit drinking and get to workat an honest calling or stay and getkilled The last was what Mulliganchose but he kept the business in hisown hands and forced the pace to theendIt was at Carson City that the endcame to Billy Mulligan The cards hadgone against him all night The liquorhe had drunk had made him ugly as hewalked out of the Esmeralda saloon onemorning- Next d oor was a laundry anda Chinaman ironing elothes lifted hisface to the window just as Mulligan waspassing Without a word the desperado drew his pistol and fired throughthe glass blowing the Chinamansbrains out then went on to the hotelwhere he was staying and upstairs tohis room in the top story The door ofhis room opened near the head of thestairway and when the sheriffs officerscame to arrest himf or killing the Chinaman he stood them off with his revolMvers They knew it meant certain deathto some of them to try to rush up thestairway and they stopped at the footto consider John Coleman a particularfriend of Mulligan who was with themtried to persuade him to surrenderNo use John said Mulligan Ishant be taken alive This is my lastday and the gamell end right hereYou keep away and dont get mixed upin the troubleColeman was working along tip thestairway as he talked with the objectperhaps of getting near enough to thedesperado to disarm himStop where you are John saidMulligan one step nearer and Ill killyouColeman made another stef forward iheart He permitted the others to takethe body away keeping them coveredwith his pistols all the time A crowdI gathered in the hotel and the publicsquare which it faced and plans werediscussed for capturing Mulligan buthis character for deadly desperationwas such that volunteers were scarceAt last it was decided to call out themilitia company and take the desperadoin his stronghold by regular assaultThe troops were mustered in doubleline in the public square facing thehotel and waiting the order to advanceThrough the window of his room in thethird story Mulligan could be seen nowand then as he walked to and fro between the stairway and the windowkeeping watch against a surprise ineither direction Then as the face of thedesperado appeared once more at thewindow one of the soldiers fired withhis rifle killing his instantly It wasan unexpected shot which undoubtedlysaved several lives that would almostcertainly have been sacrificed in carrying the room 03 stormBilly Mulligan was a New Yorkerby birth and was a typical representative of the old time California toughgambler a class which got its toneand manners from the New York of thevolunter firemen and

AdoptedThe old railroad man sat behind thecounter of a Chestnut street ticket office enjoying a mild and meditativecigar A young man with an interrogation point sortof a face leaned over thecounter and said Beg pardon roayI ask a question Thanks I observethat all railway time tables have conspicuously printed upon them Eastern standard time I suppose Im anawful ignoramus but Im blest if Iever met anyone who could clearty explahr the meaning of that Do youknowI rather think I do replied the oldrailroadman Prior to 1883 the clocksof tfiis country were in confusion indescribable Every city town and village had its own local time fixed bysolar observations Then evei y railroad had its own standard of time andsome of the large systems had severaldifferent varieties of time coveringtheir several divisions respective Inthose days if you went into a strangetown and asked one of its people thetime of day he would reply with thequestion City time or railroad timethe variation between the two beingin some cases nearly an hour A mantraveling only from Boston to Washington desirous of keeping his watch evenwith the time table would use no lessthan five different standards of timeHe would start by Boston time atProvidence he would reset his watchto Providence time at New London toNew York time at New York not asone might suppose to the local time ofthe metropolis but to Philadelphiatime which was then just five minutesslower than New York time All theway from New York to Baltimore histrain would be governed by our ownstatehouse clock but at Baltimore hewould have his watch back two minutesas the train there took Washingtontime Were he to stop off at Trentonor Wilmington or some other intermediate point the situation would befurther complicated for he would encounter local time as soon as he hadleft the depotNow continued the old railroadman relighting his cigar the enormous dangers and inconveniences ofthis system or lack of system early became manifest and schemes for its betterment were under discussion foryears Obviously the ideal solutionof the difficulty lav in the establishraent of geographical zones or beltsdefined by arbitrary lines runningnorth and south the time of some onedesignated point within each zone toprevail all over the territory withinits boundary lines Thus much agreedupon the real trouble began Thesmallest crossroads hamlet as well asthe largest citj was willing that everyother community in its particular zoneshould give up its local time but strenuously protested against changing itsown After

in useThis stated consists inbriefly dividing the country into belts of 15 degrees of longitude each and taking theactual solar time of some importantplace within each belt as the standardtime of all other places in that belt As15 degrees of longitude are equivalentto one hour of time it follows that thetime of any given belt s one hour earlier than that of the belt west and onehour later than that of the belt eastof it Eastern standard time is that ofplaces directly upon the 75th meridianwest of Greenwich and is consequently just five hours later than Greenwich time Roughly speaking-
