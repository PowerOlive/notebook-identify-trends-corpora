hadanyany right to pay for the telephones in the county offices in the Court House HouseInIn the afternoon the committee filed its report accompanied by a written writtenopinionopinion of County Attornly Moore stating that by the law the county had the thepowerpower to furnish telephones in each office but that the committee recommend recommended Â¬ed them taken out The vote was put on the adoption of the report and result resulted Â¬ed as follows followsForFor taking telephones out Squires Howell Thomason Hopkins Ander Anderson Â¬son Against Sqires Mann Barlow Keller Squire Claybrook refused to tovotevote The County Judge then said out gees the telephones it saves the county300 a year yearYesYes gentlemen it saves the county the paltry sum of 300 a year but you yousurelysurely forgot what you were doing you were slapping the country people in inthethe face and putting them to all kinds of inconvenience by voting to exclude excludethethe phones from the county offices Aint it a fact now that you thought you youwerewere discommmoding tthe town people when you voted to have them removed removedWeWe are informed though that one of the magistrates on the committee said saidhehe was a county officer and he had to pay for two phones in his residence and andthethe county officers inv the Court House ought to do the same sameInIn this day the telephone is a necessity it is a great saver of time In Inthisthis instance many of the farmers will loose many a days work by having to tocomecome to town to consult with a county official on some important business businesswhereaswhereas he could have attended to it over the phone from his home in five fiveminutesminutes minutesHeehawHeehaw laughs Maud to save 300 per year for the county It is like likenotnot noticing mountains as you drive by but every little mole hill is attacked attackedwithwith a vengeance vengeanceSquireSquire Mann by the way made a motion for the county to pay for the thelightinglighting of the court house clock He looked beseechingly for a second t his hismotionmotion but didnt find it One magistrate said thats for the town people let letthethe city pay for it He was reminded by Squire Mann that Paris was in the thecountycounty and that the citizens of Paris pay onefourth of all the county taxes taxesItsIts the truth some of these Magistrates dont really know that Paris is a part partofof Bourbon county Aint it a shame Why we dont ask you farmers to topaypay to keep lip our good sreets that you cut into with your heavy loaded wagons wagonsoror dont object to you driving your cattle up Main street when you could just justasas easy take one of the back streets In fact we know you live in Bourbon and andareare always glad to see you when you come to town Now when we say farm farmers Â¬ers above we really mean the farmer Magistrates and we do wish that the therealreal farmers will notify their respective Magistrates that Paris is in Bourbon Bourboncountycounty and that the map shows it itTHETHE STREET OILING QUESTION QUESTIONTheThe people have been clamoring for the streets to be oiled for several severalmonthsmonths thinking perhaps they were going to get one of the greatest luxuries luxuriesforfor nothing that is human nature Mayor OBrien went to work and andhadhad the Council to purchase an oiling wagon and the oil He figured the cost costasas close as it could be figured and placed the cost of oiling at 5 cents per lineal linealfootfoot in front of your property which by the way is cheaper than it wuld cost costtoto sprinkle with water daily There is no law that will allow Mayor OBrien OBrientoto have the streets of Paris oiled free of charge he cannot have the Council to tolevylevy a tax for this unless Jhe violated his oath of office and by this time the thepeoplepeople of Paris have found out that he is not going to do this It would cost costthethe city between 8000 and 10000 a year to oil all the streets The arrange arrangements Â¬OBrien has worked out in regard toments that Mayor this matter we think is iscommendablecommendable to him and are fair and just justHoweverHowever we only find oui < citizens here and there are complying with the theoilingoiling proposition This wont do unless everybody has the oiling done On one onesquaresquare you will find the oil in front of one house half way across the street streetnono oil on the opposite side then several houses will be passed no oil in front of ofthemthem etc etc etcFigureFigure this matter out for yourself and you will readily see pthat pt is ischeapercheaper than water that is if you want the dust laid and who under the sun sunprefersprefers dust to the small amount it costs to have the oil The city is oiling the thesideside streets and in front of the churches free Let us have an uptodate and anduniformuniform looking town Those who are refusing to have the oiling done should shouldtaketake a second thought about the matter and when they do will seejthe error errortheirtheir way wayWeWe would suggest that some one in each neighborhood take the matter up uphavehave measurements made and collect the money for same and hand to the Mayor Mayorandrest It is impossible for him to make houseand let him do the a to house can canvas Â¬vas in order to do the work and collect the money so if you really want the thestreetsstreets oiled getbusy and do as the Mayor stated in the papers paperso papersKIMBALLoKIMBALL ANNOUNCES FOR CONGRESS CONGRESSInIn this issue we announce the Hon Wm Preston Kimballv of
