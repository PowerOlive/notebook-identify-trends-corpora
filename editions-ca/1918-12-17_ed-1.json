DEATHS.
CLAY.
Mrs. Emma Spears Clay, aged
sixty-eight, wife of Mr. W. H. Clay,
formerly of near Paris, died at her
home, 161 Woodland avenue, in Lex
ington, Saturday night, after a long
illness.
Mrs. Clay was born in Bourbon
county on May 5, 1850, and was a
daughter of the late John K. and
Ejmily Morin Spears. She was one
of the county's most estimable wo
men, one whose genial disposition
and womanly qualities made her uni
versally esteemed and admired. With
her husband and family Mrs. Cay
resided on a fine farm near Paris,
until a few years ago, when they
moved to Lexington, where they have
since resided.
Besides her husband, Mr. W. H.
Clay, she is survived by two sons,
Mr. Matt M. Clay, of Chattanooga,
Tenn., and Mr. Roby Clay, of Lexing
ton, one sister, Mrs. J. Will Bedford,
of near Paris, and one brother,- Mr.
Solomon Spears, of -Columbus, Mo.
One of the lasting griefs of her
lovely life was the tragic death by
drowning years ago of her favoiite
son, Mr. Henry Clay.
The body, accompanied by the
funeral party, will be brought to
Paris for internment on the family lot
in -the Paris Cemetery, at eleven
o'clock this (Tuesday) morning.
Services will be conducted at the
graveside by Rev. I. J. Spencer, of
Lexington. The pall-bearers will be
Wm. P. Wornall, Woodford Buckner,
Jolm M. Clay, E. W. Wickliffe, W. H.
Warren, V. E. Phelps, Thos. Johnson
and John Ireland.
