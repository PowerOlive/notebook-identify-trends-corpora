fetched aglance around By degrees as I became accustomed to the duskiness Imade oujt the features of the placeIt was low for the bigness of theship and was furnished after a verypoor and rough sort The bunks andhammocks were old and lit to dropapart none of the timbers or work ofthe ship were smoothed except by thefriction of use and a mere dilapidatedfence served as a bulkhead to part offthe cooks quarters Luckily thesmells of the place ill as they werefor all was disordered and dirty werenot of the worst for at this time botha windward and a leeward port stoodpartly open and the passage of themall breeze through served 1o sweepout the chief est of the odorsWe did not come by a good knowledge of the place instantly for it wassomewhat dimly lighted the port onthe larboard side being closed and thatupon the starboard standing scarce twoinches upon the hook but upon peering about a bit at first one feature andhen another came OutWe had taken two or three steps forward and I was casting a glance inthe direction of the cooks furnacewhen au object nearly concealed by itmoved and this 1 presently saw wasthe cook himself He had been sittingon a box with his elbows on his kneesor in some manner bowed forward andand looked alertrose up as we stoppedly at us He was a little fellow inclined to be pursy and near all hisfigure was hidden by a long whiteapron his face however coming outin the winks of a short pipe I discovered that he had light hair whichi not common among the Spanish andthis made me notice him a little morethan I should otherwise have doneHe came out from his place seeing ushalt and made a little civil gestureupon which I bowed gravely and gaveJim good morningBeunos dias he responded andthen to my great surprise softlyadded But gude marning in theauld tongue if sae yell hae itHe took out his pipe as he spoke andcrossed over to usWhat a Sandy I cried delighted-and what is he doing hereI seized his hand and gave it a mostcordial grip as did also my companions Gae a bit cautiously lie whispered with a meaning nod toward theforecastle Ye mauna seem owerplead Youll find this a pleasantsnip e added in Spanish and ablein all weathers I take it yonder iswhere you are to sling your hamnocksMy companions caught the point hewould make which was to avoid thejealousy or suspicion of the boatswain and they did not interruptwhile I returned a suitable answerPeteetion to sling your hammocksnoo he swiftly whispered as I endedLikewise say bawldly that ye need amickle rest and wad hae a bit drinkaru2 a sup MTHE BOUKBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY APRIL 25 1899I nodded and asked aloud for a pipeMine is broken 1 said in Spanishand you know what a seaman is without his clayI am to ask the boatswain to grantus a little time below I whispered tomy companion Feign overcomingweariness as we pass outY ith this I signed to my companionsto follow and returned to the forecastle The boatswain had lighted hisown pipe and was sitting on one of themens boxes firing away in leisurelypuffsI made heavily along to him exaggerating my real weariness and preferred my requestAye if you like he replied carelessly Yonder in that corner youwill find three hammocks Sling themand afterward take vour bite Aveand have a turn with the pipe A seaman is naught without his clay andyou will be fitter for the workI thanked him and translated thetalk to my companionsWe were not long saving that wedared not mend our pace too suddenlyin slinging the hammocks and disposing of our few effectsIt was now the beginning of the firstdog watch and none of the men werein the forecastle The time was seasonable and we hastened to begin ourconfab with the cook We asked himfirst what had brought him on a Spanish ship for we Britons are not oftenfound on such and in answer he gaveus a brief but consistent story of shipping from a Scotch port and in a smartblow falling overboard to be pickedtip just in the nick of time by a Spanish coaster She carried him to Malaga he said his original port being Cartagena and from there he had beenglad to ship on the Pilanca His storjended we fell to questioning him onour present surroundings What wasthe Pilanca and who were these finepeople she carriedAweel the Pilanca is naething buta common sort of merchantman heanswered and her trade is maisttimes betwixt Havana and the straitsbut just noo she is a special chartererfrae the king She is carrying DonPerez de Guzman governor of Panama to Chagre and the auld noble yeclavered wi is the manBut now a word a to our own stateSandy I began Or first I shouldbe thankful for a better grip of yournameItll be a cordial to hear ye speak itthese loons canna he answered witha sniff Its Donald Mac Ivrach fraeClagvarlochThen friend Donald I went onwhat think you of our prospects Arethey not something dubiousI canna say nae he answered hicountenance sobering Ye are liketo be serd wi no sweet sauce auce yereach PanamaLet it rest so said Mr Tym Andnow another question Who are allthese other bravely dressed peopleI noticed both men and womenWill it be brawly dress fowk saidMaclvrach brightening Nay but wehae the governors leddy the aulddame wi the dour look and the bitwhiskers though its no sure ye wadsee them either along wi the mantilla and sic like and for anithergritane Don Luis Delasco a count by titleand rich in land and gowd but sina inand an ill tyke to look upon Heis the governors son-in-law and is notto be envied thev sav sic a deils anescauld is her leddyship Amang theithers are Don Lopez Castillo Don Enrique de Cavodilla and Don Leon deCruzon They are hidalgos and friendso the governor and three mair proudpreceese auld cocks yell gae far tofindWe were very well satisfied with thisdescription and indeed somewhat surfeited especially in view of the tempting smells from the cookery MacIvrach hastily inverted another boxhunted up three pannikins withspoons which he placed upon it andpoured out the ineFS from the pot Itproved to be a delicious onion stewWe lost no time in proving it which 1will say now pleased my palate morethan anything I ever remember of eating and in this wise I continued being no whit before my companionstill the pot was emptyMac Ivrach now crowned his hospitable efforts by producing pipes andtobacco and when we had moved theboxes about that we might take morecomfortable postures we raked a coalfrom the furnace and with great easeand pleasure proceeded to light upOur stomachs were satisfied we werecozily by ourselves and the ship wastraveling very pleasantly along sothat for the time at least we might besaid to be in a state of comparativecontent This was all the more grateful after the long hardship and exposure of the raft In the discoursethat followed we answered freely MacIvrachs questions he having till nowbut a scant knowledge of us and contrived to impress him as 1 thoughtwith the adantage to himself in continuing his friendship and good officesNot long after this some of the crewcome down and though none forcedtheir company on us we conceived thatit might not be wise to prolong ourconfab and accordingly gave the cooka sign and broke up In no great whileafterward the boatswain summonedus and we learned that we were presently to be sent into the watches andreport for duty This was done andwe found that the captain was chosenfor the first mates watch and MrTym and I for the second mates orstarboard watch It seemed that wehad four hours each continuallythat is watch and watchAt four bcHs Mr Tym and I werecalled and we left the captain to turnin he being weary enough as indeedwere we and repaired to the deckCHAPTER IXNothing noteworthy happened during our watch little indeed pressingto be done and the Spaniards too lazyor too indifferent to set us tasks Ihad Mr Tym always in my eye readyto give him a lift should need be butall passed without the callThat night passed uneventfully andas I may as well add to be brief sodid the next three days The weatherheld fair with moderate winds andthere was nothing to put a strain uponanyoneMeanwhile that this time was passing my companions and I had come bya better knowledge of things touching the voyage and the governorsplans It seemed we were to make butone more port before reaching Chagrethat being a place called Baracoa inthe eastern part of the island of CubaThere the governor was to transactsome business and obtain such freshstores as we needed and thence meantto fetch straight over for ChagreOn the morning of the fourth dayafter our rescue something of a thrilling and in part of a dreadful sort happened and this I shall now proceed todetail Mr Tym and I were lying inour hammocks it being our watch belowwhen I thought I heard some smallstir on deck followed by the bawlingof voices as though delivering commands I sat up and listened for Icould not guess what was in the windand as I did so the ship suddenly beganto saw up and downWhat is doing queried Mr Tymsitting up in his hammock as I haddoneIt is passing singular I said andwith one mind we rose and scuffed intoour shoes having a keen desire tosolve the mystery In the forecastlebeyond we met the cook who had justdescended the ladder He was a littleout of breath as though from hurryand his looks showed something hadhappenedHoots he cried without waitingfor us to speak We are a in a peekleA buccaneer will be oot yonderA buccaneer I cried in surpriseand joy Are you certain Nay thatis a pickle that is right enough Whendid he heave in sightHe has been showing a the watchhe answered and now we are risinghim fast Gin ye are eer sae walpleased ye wad be wise to hide it headded under his breathI was quick to see the wisdom of thesuggestion and returned an answeringnod Come Mr Tym I said in alower and soberer key let us go andhave a look at this pirateI Bpoke the word pirate with purposed emphasis knowing that the fellows in the watch most of whomwere now sitting up in their bunks orslapping about in their bare feet-would hear and so far understand meA pirato went from one to another The most sluggish bounced outin a twinklingLeaving thecook to finish with themor those who would stay to hearMr Tym and I hastened up the ladderTruly enough the sun was in ourfaces and the Pilanca was drivingeastward close hauledDirectly astern and I guessed nowabout four or five miles distant wasthe well defined canvas of the supposed buccaneer There was no sayinganything about him of course without a glass and I could merely guessthat he was quite a little smaller thanthe Pilanca We might be raising himbut of course that would not be apparent without longer inspectionThere was no great change in theweather The wind had strengtheneda trifle since we went below and therewas more head to the seas but otherwise everything stood nearly the sameIn this part of the ship the watchhung about the braces as though fororders and there was an anxious subdued jabber running round but no particular confusionAft I found the poop cleared of brightgowns and petticoats the prudent oldgovernor thinking doubtless it mightbe wise to offer as few allurements aspossible and in their place were fiveor six of the shining armored guardsOthers of these fighting men were disposed about the quarter deck and alltold I guessed the entire company wason duty The governor himself asomber lined cloak flung over his gayattire was walking to and fro on thepoop and Capt Placido was spying witha glass from the w ether mizzen shroudsIt went grievously against the governors pride and that of the dons torun away but in prudence no othercourse seemed open Besides the safety of the women was to be consideredThe foe had the advantage of a nimblerhandier working ship and doubtlessmustered an equal or larger crewWe discussed the matter at somelength and decided that a great watercastle like the Pilanca with relatively small sails and bluff bows must beinferior at plying and that some excellent trick of seamanship would be needed if we were to shake off a fellow likethe buccaneerAnd yet added Capt Sellingerthere is one point in our favor Imean in favor of the Pilanca the windis stiffening Should it continue shecan carry on to beat this fellow andmay yet escapeI conceive said I that we threeshould arrange some definite plot orplan of action Let us do so while yetwe have the timeThat I say amen to said the captain Mr Tym as your brain is morefertile than mine conceive somethingLet us rather all consider answered the supercargo Say that wedo so while this watch lasts and thenpresently conferAgreed we said and in order toget the use of our thoughts the better as well as to avoid suspicion MrTym and I thereupon left the captainand mingled with the crewThe Spaniards looked rather moresourly than usual upon us which perhaps was no great wonder but nothing was said and we secured a quietroost upon the midships weather railMr Tym and I did not talk for whenwe were not observing the pursuer wewere busy in reflection and I tried toforget the chatter behind me and tedinning along of the vessel while I madethe most of the timeI confess my brain refused to resolve anything or anything of moment and it was at last with somevexation and doubt of the whole matter that I gave up and jumped off myperchThe stronger wind as it seemed wasnow helping us for the sail astern nolonger enlarged after the former fashion Indeed I thought the Pilancawas nearly holding her own In duetime our watch went on and till theother relieved us the supercargo and Iwere about the deckIt was now the time that we wereto meet to discuss our plans and accordingly Mr Tym and I slipped upfrom below where we had gone withthe rest to seem the more natural andjoined the captain He had us to theweather bow near the fore deck wherewas no one at the time and without dielay we beganThere will be no need to give the fullness of the talk In the end we decided upon the scheme proposed byMr Tym and slightly amended by thecaptain It was in brief that weshould construct a little float or rafton which as soon as it became darkor it was evident that the Piianca wasto escape we shotiid boldly put offWe could make this cask of odds andends to be obtained for us by the cookand the launching would be from oneof the tween deck portsOur plot laid the next thing was tobegin to carry it out The cook as weexpected was blithe to help us Indeed he seemed I thought inclined togo with us but presently as I startedto find out more exactly about it heshifted the subject He appeared however fully enlisted in our behalfThe materials for our raft beingreadily found were put togetherFour casks were used to form theends it must necessarily be very narrow to pass through the port and allwas made fast with some strong lineand a few nailsTO BE
