earthworks at Punta Gorda Abattery on the eastward arm of thebay opened fire on the flagship andthis was also shelled About 12 8 inchshells were fired from the eastern fortsbut all fell short About five -or sixlight shells were fired from the halfcompleted battery Two of these-whizzed over the New York andone fell short The ships leftthe bay for the open seathe object of discovering thewhereabouts of the batteries havingbeen accomplished In the neighborhood of three hundred shots were puton land from the three ships at arange of from four thousand to seventhousand j ards Rr Adm Sampsonwhen asked if he was satisfied with theresult saidYes I am I expected to beThe half completed Spanish earthworks and battery were apparently allplowed up by the shellsAll the ships engaged showed excellent marksmanship throughout the engagement and when the3r were firingat the shortest range nearly everyshell took effect The forts which werebombarded were on a low lying pointand were considered merely earthworksThey did not make a good targetvet when the big guns were fired atthe shortest range portions of the fortcould be seen hying in the air at everyshotThe flagship returned to Havana andthe Puritan and Cincinnati were lefton Matanzas stationWhile the New York Puritan andCincinnati were reconnoitering inforce for the purpose of locating anddestroying the formidable defenses being constructed the flagship was firedon by the batteries on Point RubalCava and Point Maya guarding theentrance to the harbor The NewYork instantly repliedThe Puritan steamed in behind theNew York and engaged the fortification on Point Maya while the NewYork went to starboard close upto the land and poured hershells into Rubal Cava The Cincinnati which had remained well asterntmder orders signaled for permissionto engage and received it and soonwas firing her guns at the fort on thewest side of the bay It took the threeships just 18 minutes to silence thebatteriesImmediately the fort at Matanzasopened fire the Puritan returned thefire from an eight inch gun The firstshptmissed The second shotstruckthefort on the eastern end and crumbledfive tons of solid masonry Fort Morello

at about 12C0yards The ships could have thrownmroe metal but the captains preferred to be leisurely about it TheSpanish marksmanship was wretched The Puritans enormous turretguns did awful damage Ihe projectiles were visible in their flightWhen hit the masonry of the fortcrumbled to powder Sand batterieswent up in clouds when struck Onlya few shells struck the town and thoseaccidentally The New York andPuritan avoided shooting at anythingbut government propertyAbout 1 oclock a gun on the westernside of the fort that had been bestserved was dismounted by a dischargefrom the New York All of the gunscrew must have been killed ManySpaniards must have been killed Notone American was injured By nightthe forts were silenced but did not surrenderThe Spaniards used explosive shellsand some of the shrapnell fell on theNew YorkThe peace of the blockade has beenbroken Blood has been spilled Itwas Spanish blood and the red fluid attested that the Dons realty mean todefend their title to Cuba Matanzasthe scene of much of the ghastly suffering imposed by Weyler saw the firstengagement Hundreds of starving re-concentradoes deprived now by Blanco hof supplies contributed by Americansheard the bijr jnins of Uncle Samsships thunder forth a salute to libertyAt the sound they hastened to theheights near the city of Matanzas andfrom that point of vantage watchedthe duel between the war ships andthe shore batteriesFor some time the New York usedonly her smaller guns But prettysoon the heavy boom of her big gunamidships reverberated among thehills After the firing had continuedfor some 10 minutes the Puritan wassignalled to get into the game Shetook a position on the port side ofthe New York and about a mile and ahalf from the east shore batteries There she promptly drew theattention of the first two batteries onthe west shore At the first the Puritan used onlr her secondarj battery toget the range of the batteries whichwere almost invisible their localitybeing indicated however by thesmoke By this time the firing wasquite rapid from both the New Yorkand PuritanThe flag ship lay so that shepresenteda broadside to both shores and sheused her guns after a few range-findingshots with excellent results Theaccuracy of her gunners was continually attested by clouds of sand and water which flew around the shore batteries The Spaniards replied steadilybut with no effect Meanwhile theCincinnati was impatient to take ahand Finally Capt Chester receivedpermission to bring his ship into action He adroitly chose a position lessthan 2000 yards from the west shorebatteries and it soon developed thatwhile exposed fully to his fire theycould not train their guns on thecruiserUntil the end of the engagement theCincinnati maintained an effective fireon the Point Maya or east shore batteries This combined and destructivefire soon gave the men on shoreenoughIn less than 20 minutes from thetime they opened fire on the NewYork their fire had been silencedThe result of the engagementcreated the greatest enthusiasm amongofficers and men and increased if thatis possible the desire to take a cackat Morro Castle Within ten minutesafter the engagement had ended a special dispatch boat was alongside theNew Yrork Congratulations were extended to Adm Sampson who returnedhis compliments He requested thevessel to carry the official dispatchesreporting the battle to Key WestAll told the United States ships firedSO shots at the forts This is byactual count from our dispatch boatThe forts fired probably 25 shots Thebombardment developed that thelargest pieces mounted by the Spanishat Matanzas are eight inch gunsand the best opinion is that there arenot more than five or six guns thereBut far more important than the destruction of the Matanzas ba teries isthe conclusion about the future whichmay be drawn from the bombardmentThe conclusion is that Havana is absolutely at the mercy of the Unitedbtates fleet whenever we choose toopen fire Adm Sampson Wednesday with guns which amount toless than one tenth of his fightingforce silenced what was practicallythree batteries in 20 minutes Hesteamed right in on them as close ashe could get and not one of our shipswas touched What is to be said of aqrunner that can not hit a mark asbg as the New York at 2000or 3000 yards The incident has greatly encouraged the naval officers andthey believe that when they bombardHavana they will destroy all the defense in about one hourWashington April 2S So far ascould be learned the officials of theadministration were riot notified ofthe bombardment of Matanzas Wednesday morning The navy department keeps a full fledged telegraphoffice open in the building allliio htand a confidential officer remains at thedepartment all night to translate themessages as

Confirmed in the Personof Judjjo Day Reorganizationof the Army BegunWashington April 27 Great Britain always has taken an advance standin the principles of neutrality so thatit was with great interest that thenews was received here of the termsof the neutrality proclamation issuedin London On the whole the officialsare disposed to take the view that astrict adherance by Great Britain tothese rules will be rather more advantageous to the United States than toSpain particularly as we are nowoperating in the naval sense close toour own base of supplies and in allprobability soon will cut Spain offfrom the two bases that she now hasin the neighborhood of CubaThe Seizure of PrizesThe president issued a proclamationduring the day laying down rules as tothe seizure of prizes and the result itis believed will be the release of someof the ships already captured thoughit will be for the prize courts to determine in each case whether the conditions under which the ship was captured are such to warrant releaseThe impression prevails that the BuenaVentura the first on the list of prizeswill be declared no prize The case ofthe Panama whose seizure was reported Tuesday is more complicatedowing to the fact that whileotherwise exempt the ship was reported to have contained supplies forthe Spanish army in Cuba which arecontrabandHowever it may be said that whilethe settlement of these questions willbe left to the courts the administration believes the greatest liberalityshould be shown in the application ofthe laws where a vessel is not contraband or attempting to run the blockade That is shown in the liberalterms of the proclamation itself b3rwhich the prize courts must be guidedIn Regrard to PrivateeringIt is noticed also that the administration has not been deterred by anycriticism in congress from again formally pledging itself to the nations ofthe world to refrain from privateeringand abide by the declaration of Parisof 1S5GOur Consuls Safely Out or SpainSo far as

Sagua points on theCuban coast one north and one southrespectively with a view to effectingjunctures with both Gen Gomez andGen Garcia Now that Lieut Rowanis on his way to effect a juncture fromSantiago it is not improbable that another juncture will be made by way ofSagua The first purpose of thesemovements it is understood is tobring about a full equipment ofthe insurgent forces rather thanto secure a joint movement between them and the United Statestroops It is said that Garciaand Gomez together can muster 35000men and that they will be able tomake a strong forward movement

forService in CubaWashington April 2S The secretary of war is strongly in favor ofamendment of the existing volunteerlaw that will permit recruiting at leasthalf a dozen special regiments of yellow fever immunes for services inCuba One such regiment has alreadybeen recruited in Louisiana and Senator Caffery Wednesday presenteda letter at the war departmentfrom the son of Gen Hood by whomthe regiment was organized tenderingits services to the government Underthe existing law there can be onlythree extra regiments recruited Oneof these is already appropriated to DrWood and ex Secretary Roosevelt forhis cowboys who are already beingdesignated in the department as Teddys Terrors Great pressure is beingbrought to bear from various quartersto secure the other two regimentsThe secretary of war it is understood holds that the practical value ofimmune regiments is greater than thesentimental and political claims ofvarious applicants for regimentalhonor He wants 0000 immunes provided for and asked Senator Caffrey ifthey could be raised in the gulf statesThe senator replied that he could realize 20000 volunteers in New Orleansalone as practically all the nativeshad had the fever

Private advicesreceived from Cuba say that a force of500 American and Cuban soldiers haslanded at Guanabacoa under the leadership of the Cuban Chief La Cret Acolumn of Spanish troops has beensent to check the advance of the invadersTo Destroy American CommerceMadrid April 2S There is a reportn circulation here that- some of theSpanish cruisers now gathered aboutManila will be used laterto scour thefacmc ana destroy American comnerce in those watersammunition and medical suppliesThe latter and particularly quinineis said to be greatly needed The understanding among those best acquainted with the plans of co-operationis that the Cuban forces will advance on Havana and make a landsiege in co operation with the blockade now in progress by the UnitedStates warshipIn this connection there is renewedtalk of a recognition of the Cubansat least their belligexency and possiblytheir independence and confidenthopes were expressed Wednesday inhigh Cuban circles that recognitionwould be granted in the next twoweeks One of the first effects of thisit is said would be to srive the Cubansan official status at Washington instead of their present unofficial statusThe conferences now held with GenMiles and other officials are being productive of important results and yetthey are necessarily unofficial in character owing to the unrecognizedstatus of the Cubans Now howeverthat Gomez and Garcia are being recognized as material factors in the contest and are being treated with bythe war department the desirability of their recognition atleast as belligerents is beingurged as warranting formal recognition It is said the co operationalready established is in itself a recognition of the de facto existence ofthe Cuban army and of belligerencyand that the de jure recognition shouldfollow While these hopes are renewedin Cuban circles it can not be learnedthat the administration has modifiedits attitude against recognition of invcharacterIn the event of Cuban recognition itis probable that President Palma ofthe Cuban Junta would be the firstminister accredited from Cuba withSenor Quesada as charge daffaires atWashington and Senor Albertini asfirst secretaryNomination of John B

Imight regret in case he should be Butit was plain he was in earnest and Ihad never heard father say that AbelBrathvaite ever joked Idid not replyand he went onL havent the slightest doubt thatjour assurance is unbounded enough tobring you all the way from the westand into my very house to demand that3000It was the misunderstanding afterall I could not credit my own eyesand ears but 1 replied seeing no reasonto hold myself in checkMy assurance would be unboundedif I came all the way from the west todemand money from a notorious tightfist like yourselfThis seemed to amuse him for someunaccountable reason A smile glintedthrough his anger as if he suddenlyappreciated the opportunity to see justhow far western assurance would goread it thus and determined that heshould be fully satisfiedAnd I have no doubt he proceededthat you have made yourself- believethat upon your mere demand I wouldcount out 5000 and hand them to youI did uot come here to discuss thatmatter at all Mr Brathwaite but nowthat you have mentioned it I have nohesitation in saying that I think myfather is absolutely right in his contention If you ever owed a dollar youowe him that live thousand and yourturning and quibbling is little less thancommon dishonestyYoung man he laughed this is refreshing absolutely invigorating Icame dovn to turn you out of doorsbut I wont do it I need someone toamuse m this evening and you arcquite satisfactory ProceedHe sat down in the nearest chair re-adjusied his eyeglasses and placinghis hands on his knees looked into myface with well simulated expectationof enjoying- a treat I walked over tohim looked iriui sqiiarehvan the eyesand saidYou know as well as you are livingMr Brathwaite that you owe myther that 5000 but I want to tell youupon which 1 read Richard Downs i thai we dont need itMy puzzled expression in trying toplace the name led him to explainI saw the name on the register andtook the liberty of speaking to you inthe hope that you might be AdamCraydors son ITe was a business acquaintance oE my father many yearsago I am here in the east on a matterof business and pleasure and if youare Adam Craydors son it would bequite agreeable to me to renew the oldfriendshipI am Adam Craydors son I replied slipping the card into my vestpocket and I remember now that Ihave heard him speak of your fatherI am on my way to make a call but Ishall be glad to meet you later in theeveningI left him and shortlj reached theBrathwaite home I asked the maidwho answered the ring for Miss Amyand gave her my card Her glance atthe card and at me as she showed meinto the parlor was curious to say theW least I thought 1 saw amusedtatipn in it but regarding this as onlythe innate impudence of maids 1 dismissed the impression and sat down towaitI saw in the parlor evidences of adaintiness and good taste that musthave been Amys and I grew quiteeager to see how she would receive meOn the endof the mantel stood a cabinet photograph of my father whichquieted my fears that Abel Brathwaitemight be resentful on account of thebusiness misunderstanding My surprise may be imagined therefore whenI heard an angry voice at the top ofthe stairs sajingOf course 111 go down We mightbs well settle the matter now Theresno use saying dont Im going and ifyou want to hear my opinion of himand his father stand here at the top ofthe stairs and ljstenWhat he thought of father and meI knew that Brathwaite had censuredfather for his part in the misunderstanding and I had written a numberof letters which I had tried to makeparticularly courteous but I had notknown that the old gentleman was hostile I listened for the reply of the person he addressed and it came down tome in a soft musical voiceBe firm with him father she saidTell hjm exactly what we think butplease dont be rudeFirm repeated the old gentlemanNever fear I shall be firm and a littlerude too I expectHad Air Brathwaite become childish Ho other explanation seemedplausible If he were in his right mindsurely a disagreement over a trifle of55000 would not have turned the oldtime friendship to enmity It was evident that he was in no moodto receivemy fathers kindest remembrances Ithought all this to the accompanimentr Um jsmjWe had forgotten all about having made you a present of it but it seems to be a stupendous item to you You are entirely welcome to it ButI was stopped by the rustle of adress upon the stairs Amy had beenand was coming to interfereI hoped she would not for my regardfor her was genuinely tender and Ifeared that I could not hold my ownwith her father if she were present Jwas greatly relieved when T heard therustle cease as if she had paused upon the stairs to consider the wisdomof appearing- I should have taken mydeparture at that juncture I supposebut 1 felt that I had not told the oldgentleman quite enough so I decided to stay until I thought I haddone him full justiceI want to tell you sir Twent onthat we still have some regard forfriendship in the westHe looked surprised at this and Tpaused doubtfully but seeing his facegrowing more contemptuous I finishedI didnt come hero to demand or request or even mention that unfortunate5000 My father is as sorryOh bother your father He isntsorry A man whoBe careful sir T wont hear oneword said against him T repeat that Ididnt come here to mention that 5000butOh T suppose now you come in genuine western impertinence to ask mefor my daughter AmyHe was interrupted by the quick rustle of the dres as the young lady inquestion rapidly retreated I wincedas I recollected tint such a request hadnot been entirely foreign to my hopesIf you ever had any prospect of success in that matter he continuedyou have utterly ruined it by yourlanguage here to night I think youwould have submitted to all I have saidif you are anxious to win herNo I would not I answered Youwould not respect a young man whowould weakly submit when he believesyou are wrong as you certainly areAccording to your view of it Whenyour father had the impudence to writethat he would say no more about thatmatter of 5000 if I would permit youtoeome east and try to win my dauarhter I made up rav mind that when youcame you workImeet aStop right there sir My fathernever wrote such a thingITe s nriled in serene confidence as hfakedWould you line to see his letterI certainly Mould 1 dont believeyen can show any such document Ichallenge you to do soI threw out this challenge quite boldly but inwardly I felt a little weakover the possibility that father mijrhthave been foolish enough tc write sucha letter He had often spolcep to meof Amy and hinted at the desirabilityof a match between us He had cvensaid that Abel himself had written thathe would be agreeable to such an alliance But this was before the difference These reflections sobered mesomewhat and I said more mildlyMr Braithwaite I will be frank withyou and say that 1 expected a far different reception here and I fear thatmy surprise and I may say disappointment has led me to say things I shouldnotYou can hardly patch the matter urnow young man But how could youexpect a different reception You cannot be conscious of your impertinencein calling here at allIs it impertinent for me to wish tcsee your family -when I have not hadthat pleasure for so longTo be sure it is when you come onthis errand There is some limit to theforbearance of friendship But youhave amused me enough now and Illask you toA sharp peal of the bell interruptedHe turned his head to listen and 1 stoodwaiting disdainfully The maid wentto the door and brought a card to AbelHe cast a glance at it sprang up cametoward me and askedWho are you anyhowV1 should think you would knowfrom the way you have talked to me1 replied hotlyThen there must be two young menrejoicing under he name of RichardDownsRichard Downs I cried feelingin my vest pocket and drawing out acardI glanced at it and saw my own nameA thousand pardons sir I exclaimed I gave you the wrong cardIm not Richard DownsWho in the name of sense are jouthenI gave him my cardWhat a fool Ive made of myselfhe cried I should have known thisWhy Mr Craydor there isnt anyonewt would rather see here than yourselfHe bade the maid tell Richard Downto call again then running into thehall calledAmy come down here and see theguest Ive been abusing to the best olmy abilityHe did not need to call twice and ina moment I was made glad by thegreeting I had hoped for The similarity of the disputes Mr Braithwaite hadwith Mr Downs and my father may beeasily surmised There were facts inthe latter however that warranted allhe had said to the supposed sonThe only way T could ease their mortification was to transfer my luggageto their home During my stay Abelwas continually asking about his common dishonesty and whether he was anotorious tightfist But I retaliatedwith western impertinence and unparalleled impudence and eventuallyby winning Amys heart in subsequentvisits and taking her out to Chicagowhither her father soon followed andwjiercwe all Jive in the closest friend-shipMISSION OF DON QUIXOTEThe Author Declared It Was Writtento Riilienlc Alisnril Storicxof ChivalryThe object of Cervantes in writingDon Quixote was as he himself declared to render abhorred of men thefalse and absurd stories contained inthe books of chivalry The fanaticismcaused by these romances was so greatin Spain during the sixteenth centuiythat the burning of all extant copiewas earnestly requested by the eori eaor legislature of the realm To destroy a passion tliat had taken suchdeep root among all classes to breakup the only reading which at that timewas fashionable and popular was abold undertaking yet one in whichCervantes succeededNo books of chivalry were writtenafter the appearance of Don Quixoteand from that time those in existencehave been steadily disappearing untilnow they are among- the rarest of literary curiosities This romance whichCervantes threw so carelessly from hispen and which he only regarded aan effort to break up tho absurd fancies about chivalry has now thereforebecome thn oldest specimen of romanticfiction and one of the most remarkablemonuments to geniusTen years after its appearance itsauthor published the second part ofDon Quixote which is even betterthan the first It was written in hisold age when in

Pennsylvania Mycologieal club in a dissertation on thepepper plant says that during the middle ages in Europe pepper was the mostesteemed and important of all thespices Genoa Venice and other commercial cities of Central Europe wereindebted to their traffic in pepper fora large part of their wealth Its importance as a means of pi omoting commercial activity and civilization duringthe middle ages can hardly be overrated Tribute was levied in pepperand donations were made in this1 spicewhich was frequently also used as amedium of exchange in place of moneyWhen the imperial city of Rome wasbesieged by Alaric the Icing of theGoths in 40 A D the ransom demanded included 5000 pounds of gold 30000 pounds of silver and 000 poundsof pepper illustrating the importanceof this spiee at that timeSo called pepper rents common during the middle ages consisted in an obligation imposed upon a tenant to supply his landlord with a pound of pepper at stated times showing how acceptable was this favorite condimentI and how great was the desire of thewealthier classes to secure a regularsupply of it Spice dealers were knownis piperarii in English pepperers andin French poivriers As a fraternityDr guild they existed in London in thereign of Henry IT 1154 1189 Theywere subsequently incorporated intothe Grocers company and had the control of the trade in spices drugs dyestuffs and

any sort of reputation for honest decent goods In writing on this phase of the question to theNew York Produce Review a Sl r Dodgefeays sniong other things All thetrouble that I have had in the past threeyears has been from sappy green woodand the trouble can only be overcomeby having the wood thoroughly dry andfit for use There is nothing manufactured that is made out of wood untilthe wood is properly seasoned I seeno reason why this should not follow asregards butter tubs No reason whatever except the rapacity and narrowgreed of some of thase manufacturersIt makes a great difference in the priceof butter that is not packed in firstclass and thoroughly seasoned tubs orthose raw and fresh Tubs may look allright on shipment but after the butterhas been in transit to market the defects become apparent and the goodsare reported as off affecting top quotations Butter makers should exercise the greatest care in such mattersand if possible make such concernssign a contract to make good

many years and I tapped a cesspool which bordered on the meadowand carried the night soil on handbarrows to each hill manuring very liberally As the season advanced the vinesstarted oft almost on the run for withthe nitrogen in the night soil added tothe nitrogen of the rich meadow theyhad a mighty dose of it The rank vineswith the ends of their runners liftedinto the air and their tips bent just

a few which grew alongthe borders of a ditch which ranthrough the meadow that were moruor less eaten by muskrats the crop wassafely housed before the first frost Thefinal result was anything but satisfactory f or the quality of the squash provedto be quite inferior they were ratherpunky in their structure and soggy intheir make up both of which characteristics helped them on to an early

latter is in ashallow galvanized tray fitting in thetop and the full size of the crate Oneold style that I saw this morning had anarrow upright receptacle for the icewhich formed a sort of partitionthrough the center of the crate Another had a shallow ice pan in the center of the top of a size that alloweda row of berry baskets to be set aroundWtAUlREFRIGERATOR CRATEit This perhaps saved space but didnot carry the fruit in so good conditionThe idea in the newest pattern seems tobe that the ice is distributed over theentire upper surface of the crate thuscooling the whole evenly and as coldair settles it goes all down through thecrate uniformly The berries in thesecrates seem to arrive in fine conditionThe construction is pretty well shownin the illustration This crate measured outside measure about two feettwo inches by two feet six inches bytwo feet seven inehes It held fourlayers of quart baskets 1G in each layer C4 in alL As shown a drain pipeextends from the bottom of the crateup nearly to the bottom of the panand a spout from the latter drains offthe water from the melting ice Theice pan can be lifted out to get at thoberries There is a ventilator throughthe middle of the crate as shown Thewhole is solidly built The eover isfastened on vwth bolts set stationaryin the crate projecting through thecorners of the cover and fastened withnuts The

Attracts AttentionAmong Hundreds of CaptivesIn a big bird store where there arehundreds of birds of many kinds incessantly squawking chirping and singingthere is one that is free a tiny titmouse The window is full of cagescontaining birds of various sorts andone side of the store is lined with birdcages stacked up high all along Butthere is none that attracts so much attention as the little titmouse flittingabout the store at will At night itperches on a gas fixture in the windowand to that it comes back from its various excursions by dayCustomers that come in to buy birdsand birdcages and bird seed and onething and another never fail to noticethe titmouse They may not notice another bird there individually but theirattention is sure to be attracted by thisone as it darts about free among somany captives and they are likely tosmile at it they are so pleased witb itAnd sometimes children looking in atthe windows of the bird store come into tell the clerk that one of the birdshas got looseWhen it has nothing else to do thetitmouse sits on its gas pipe perch andperks its head this way and that andlooks about Sometimes it whets itsbeak on the gas pipe Every now andthen it dashes off somewhere If itwants a drink it perches on the rim ofa goldfish globe for home aquariumsand stock for them are sold here as wellas birds no doubt to the great surpriseof the goldfishes and certainly to thatof the human beholders who wonderthat it doesnt fall in it has to bendover so far to reach the water Eut itgets it and when it has taken its fill itflashes back to its perch on the pipe inthe windowTho titmouse catches spiders and other insects and it feeds in the largercages when it will It goes in and outof them between the bars with perfectease It is a very little bird even withits plumage in its natural form Withits feathers pressed against its sides itcan get through a very narrow spacebetween the bars of a parrots cage forexample with ease There are in thewindow a number of parrots cages in arows- The titmouse almost flies throughthese cages stopping in each perhaps toeat of the parrots food but they nevermolest it Parrots that would bite atthe finger of a man who should put hishand near enough to the outside of theircage stand back in fright or sheeramazement when the little titmousedashes in and perches on their feed cupNew York SunGerman EducationThe
