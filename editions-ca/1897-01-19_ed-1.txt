since that time thegovernment tacitly admitting such unusual circumstances or being powerlessto collect them because the rebeswere in possession of the country didnot press their collections consequently no taxes have been paid in thecountry since the date mentiom dBesides that Weyler has unofficiallyordered that no sugar crop should bemade and now he wants the sugarplanters to pay taxes

dispatchto yon or to let you read it liethrew the dispatch down before the oldgentleman who adjusted his spectaclesand read it Then he looked up inquiringly at WentworthYou dont understand it do yousaid the latterI confess I do not The Longworthin this telegram does not refer to medoes itNo it does not refer to you but itrefers to one of your house Yournephew William Longworth is ascoundrelAh said the old man placing thedispatch on the desk again and removing his glasses Have jrou cometo tell me thatYes I have Did you know it beforeNo I did not answered the oldgentleman his color rising and I donot know it now I know you say soand I think very Ulcety you will be gladto take back -what you have said Iwill at least give you the opportunitySo far from taking it back AfrLongworth I shall prove it Yournephew formed a partnership with myfriend Kenyon and myself to float onthe London market a certain CanadianmineMy dear sir broke in the old gentleman I have no desire to hear ofmy nephews private speculations Ihave nothing to do with them I havenothing to do with your mine Thematter is of no interest whatever to meand I must decline to hear anythingabout it You are also if you will excuse my saying so not in a fit state oftemper to talk to any erentleman Ifyou like to come back here when youSare calmer I shall be very pleaded toflisten to what you haveto sayI shall never be calmer on this sub-ject I have told you that your nephewis a scoundrel You are pleased to denythe accusationI do not deny it I merely said I didnot know it was the case and I do notbelieve it that is allVery well the moment I begin toshow you proofs that things are as IsaMy dear sir cried the elder manwith some heat you are not showingproof You are merely making assertions and assertions about a man whois absent who is not here to defendhimself If you have aujthing to sayagainst William Longworth come andsay it when he is here arid he shall answer for himself It is cowardly ofyou and ungenerous to me to make anumber of accusations which I am in nowise able to refuteWill you listen to what I have tosayNo I will notThen by God you shall andwith that Wentworth strode to the doorand turned the key while the old manTose from his seat and faced himDo you mean to threaten me sir inmy own officej t I mean to say Mr Longworth thatI have made a statement which I amgoing to prove to you I mean that youshall listen to me and listen to me nowAnd I say if you have anything tocharge against ni3r nephew come andsay it when he is hereWhen he is here Mr Longworth itwill be too late to say it at present youvcan repair the injury he has done Whenhe returns to England you cannot do sono matter how much you might wish tomake the attemptThe old man stood irresolute for a moment then he sat down in his chairagainVery well he said with a sigh Iam not so combative as I once was Go- on with your storjMy story is very short said Wentworth It simply amounts to thisYou know your nephew formed a partnership with us in relation to the Canaiian mineI know nothing about it I tell youanswered Mr LongworthVery well you know it nowI know you say soDo you doubt my wordI will tell you more about that whenI hear what you have to say Go onWell your nephew pretending toaid us in forming this company did- everything to retard our progress Heengaged offices that took a long timeto fit up and which we had at last tottake a hand in ourselves Then he leftfor a week leaving no address and re-- -fusing to answer the letters I sent to hisoffice for him On one pretext or au-mother the forming of the company wasMs -delayed until at length when the op-- tion by which Mr Kenyon held the mineV shaoSonly a month to run your nephewwent to America in company with MrMeville ostensibly to see and repbrVupon the property After waiting acertain length of time and hearing nothing from him he had promised to cableus Kenyon went to America to get a renewal of the option This cablegramexplains his success He finds on goingthere that your nephew has securedthe option of the mine in his own nameand as Kenyon says we are cheatedNow have you any doubt whether yournephew is a scoundrel or notMr Longworth mused for a few moments on what the young man had toldhimIf what you say is exactly true thereis no doubt that William has been guiltyof a piece of very sharp practiceSharp practice cried the otherYou might as well call robbery sharppracticeMy dear sir I have listened to younow I ask you to listen to me If asI say what you have stated is true mynephew has done something which tthink an honorable man would not dobut as to that I cannot judge until Ihear his side of the story It may pua different complexion on the matterand I have no doubt it will but evengranting your version is true in everyparticular what have I to do with itI am not responsible for my nephewsactions He has entered into a businessconnection it seems with two youngmen and has outwitted them That isprobably what the world would sayabout it Perhaps as you say he hasbeen guilty of something worse andhas cheated his partners But even admitting everything to be true I do notsee how I am responsible in any wayLegally you are not morally Ithink you areWhyIf he were your sonBut he is not my son he is mynephewIf your son had committed a theftwould you not do everything in yourpower to counteract the evil he haddoneI might and I might not Some fathers pay their sons debts others donot I cannot say what action I shouldtake in a purely supposititious caseVery well all I have to say is ouroption runs out in two or three daysTwenty thousand pounds will securethe mine for us I want that 20000before the option ceasesAnd do you expect me to pay you20000 for thisYes I doOld Mr Longworth leaned back in hisoffice chair and looked at the youngman in amazementTo think that you a man of the citywould come to me another man of thecity with such an absurd idea in yourhead is simply grotesqueThen the name of the Longworths isnothing to you the good name ImeanThe good name of the Longworthsmy dear sir is everything to me but1 think it will be able to take care of itself without any assistance from youThere was silence for a few momentsThen Wentworth said in a voice of suppressed anguish I thought MrLongworth one of your family was ascoundrel I now wish to say 1 believethe epithet covers uncle as well asnephew You have a chance to repairthe mischief one of your family hasdone You have answered me with contempt You have not shown me theslightest indication of wishing to makeamendsHe unlocked the doorCome now said old Mr Longworthrising that will do that will do MrWentworth Then he pressed an electric bell and when the clerk appearedhe said Show this young gentlemanthe door please and if he ever callsagain do not admit himAnd so George Wentworth clenchinghis hands with rage was shown to thedoor He had the rest of the day toponder on the fact that an angry manseldom accomplishes his purposeCHAPTER XXnThe stormy interview with Wentworth disturbed the usual serenity ofMr Longworths temper He wenthome earlier than was customary withhim that night and the more hethought over the attack the more unjustifiable it seemed He wonderedwhat his nephew had been at and triedto remember what Wentworth hadcharged against him He could not recollect the angrier portions of the interview having as it were blotted thecharges from his mind There remained however a bitter resentmentagainst Wentworth Mr Longworthsearched his conscience to see if hecould be in the least to blame but hefound nothing in the -recollection ofhis dealings with the young men tojustify him in feeling at all responsible for the disaster that had overtakenthem He read his favorite eveningpaper with less than his usual interest for every now and then theepisode in his office would crop up inhis mind Finally he said sharplvEdithYes father answered his daughterYou remember a person namedWentworth whom you had here theevening William went awayYes fatherVery well Never invite him to thishouse againWhat has he been doing asked theyoung woman in a rather tremulousvoiceI desire you never to ask anyoneconnected with him that man Kenyonfor instance continued her father ignoring her questionI thought she answered thatMr Kenyon was not in this country atpresentHe is not out he will be back againI suppose At any rate I wish to havenothing more to do with those peopleYou understand thatYes fatherMr Longworth went on with hisreading Edith saw that her fatherwas greatly disturbed and she muchTHE jfflOJfcBUN TUESDAY JAUAEY 19 1897out knew enough of human nature-to believe that in a very shorlftimehe would relieve her anxiety He againappeared to be trying to fix his-attentionon the paper Then he threw itdown and turnedThat man WentwoEthhe soidbitterly behaved to day in a most unjustifiable manner to me in my officeIt seems that William and he andKenyon embarkedi in some mine projectI knew nothing of their doings andiwasnot even consulted with regard ito themNow it appears- William has gone toAmerica and done something Wentworth considers wrong Wentworthcame to me and demanded 20000the most preposterous thing ever heardof said I owed it to clean the goodname of Longworth as if the goodname were dependent on him or anyone like him I turned him out of theoffice4Edith did not answer for few moments while her father gave expression to his indignation by various ejaculations that need not be here recordedDid he say she spoke at lengthin what wray William had donewrongI do not remember now just whathe said I Icnow I told him to comeagain when my nephew was presentand then make his charges against himif he wanted to do so Not that I admitted I had anything to do with thematter at all but I simply refused tolisten to charges against an absentman I paid no attention to themThat certainly was reasonable replied Edith What did he say to itOh he abused mev and abused William and went on at a dreadful rateuntil I was obliged to order him out ofthe officeBut what did he say about meetingWilliam at your office and making thecharges against him thenWhat did he say 1 dont rememberOh yes he said it would be too latethen that they had only a few days todo what business they have to doandthat is why he made the demand for20000 It was to repair the harmwhatever the harm was William haddone I look on it simply as some blackmailing scheme of his and T am astonished that a man belonging to as gooda house as he does should try that gamewith me I shall speak to the elderpartner about it to morrow and if hedoes not make the youngman apologizein the most abject manner he will bethe loser by it 1 can tell him thatI would think no more about it father if I were you Do not let ittrouble you in the leastOh it doesnt trouble me but youngmen nowadays seem to think they cansay anything to their elders -I mean she continued that Iwould not go to his partner for a day ortwo Wait and see what happens IDid he say she spoke -at lenjctij in rltatway William had done wronghave no doubt when he thinks over thematter he will be thoroughly ashamedof himselfWell I hope soThen give him the chance of beingashamed of himself and take no farther steps in the matterEdith very shortly afterward wentto her own room and there claspingher hands behind her she walked upand down thinking with a verytroubled heart on what she had heardHer view of the matter was very different from that of her father She feltcertain something wrong had been doneby her cousin For a long time she haddistrusted his supposed friendship forthe two young men and now she pictured to herself John Kenyon in thewilds of Canada helpless and despondent because of the great wrong that hadbeen done him It was far into the nightwhen she retired and it was early nextmorning when she arose Her fatherwas bright and cheerful at breakfastand had evidently forgotten all aboutthe unpleasant incident of the day before A good nights sleep had erasedit from his memory Edith was glad ofthis she did not mention the subjectAfter he had gone to the city the youngwoman prepared to follow him Shedid not take her carriage but hailed ahansom and gave the driver the numberof Wentworths offices That youngman was evidently somewhat surprisedto see her He had been trying to writeto Kenyon some account of his interview with old Mr Longworth andsomehow after he had finished hethought John Kenyon would not at allapprove of his zeal so had just torn theletter upTake this chair he

straight factsabout Jim Wrights courtship and marriage as well as anybody It happenedabout 20 years ago and it interestedthe folks around Barklejrs corners somuch that for four or five years therewasnt no quiltin bee nor mite society nor apple cut nor raisin norpullhithat somebody didnt tellsomething new about it and I guess1ItKere talking about it yet -at the teajA3rinkins It was all brought backfresh to my mind one day last weekhen I found out my oldest boy Silevas kind o shinin up to Jims oldestgirl Sarah named after her motherJims apretty prominent citizen nowHes the manager of the Barkley placeand a member of the countv board of-supervisors and some do say hes gotbis eye on the legislature for next termYes thats him goin by now You seebes a big tall feller and looks kind ofimposin like When he was a youngster hie wasnt exactly what youd callHi and some but he looked as solid as arock and his eyes was always widepen -only when he had to face a girlthen he used to weaken Thats whatTnade his courtship and marriage soicuriousA good talker Well yes e is nowNot very polished maybe but he Cctnspeak to the pint and thats more thanome of your college educated fellerscan do But he never was much of aspeaker till after he got married toSarah AndersonJim got well acquainted with Sarah-when he was nothing but a hired manworkin on the Barkley place when oldman Thompson was manager Sarahwas workin there too then She wasMrs Thompsons hired girl STo youcouldnt call em servants the way youcity folks look at it Saralhs father wasold Deacon Anderson and he stood justas well in the community as old manThompson did maybe better becauseDeacon Anderson owned his own farmv and Thompson was a kind of a hiredman for Barkley The Barkley placeyou know is about 800 acres Its thebiggest farm in this town and Barkleyliimself spends most of his time in NewYork and Boston and Europe and otherfar away places where folks has moremoney than brains and has coachmento drive for m and puts on differentcoats at different times of the day andsill that Sarah Anderson used to eatAt the same table with the Thompsonsof course and so did Jim Why if7 cither of them had been asked to eat Septra te from the family theyd have quitiright off and everybody around thejtiers would have backed em up in it tooVfihy the Thompsons would have beenrun out of the neighborhood if theydset themselves up to be too good tohave Jim Wright and Sarah Andersonset with them when they et their mealsJim Wrights father you know wasthe doctor here fora good many years- - and he wanted to send his boy tolcgQy but Jim wouldnt go He likedwith his hands better thanistudyin books He said h could makemore money in the long run his wayaid when he hired out to old manThompson he declared that hed bemanager of the big farm some dayand so he is now as I told you a little- while agoMaybe Im getting off the story arjlitth bit but I just wanted to explainaiow Jim and Sarah stood in tinsjl -- 1

hull lot No she wasntslender and willowy nor anything likerhat but she was tall and healthy andred oheeked and bright eyed and sheheld her head up and looked as thoughshe was glad to be alive all the timeAs I said before Jim was a good talkeronly when he was Iookin a girl in theface Then he was about the bashf ulestcritter you ever seen and he used toset and say nothing at all meal timesat old man Thompsons where his chairstood just -across the table fromSarahs Thompson and his wife theyused to joke Jim a good deal aboutSarah and so did the other hired menNo they didnt all feed at Thompsonstable but they all knew how bashfulJim was There was a hull lot of emand some of em was married men andlived in the tenant houses that are-scattered over the place and them thatwasnt married all but Jim boardedwith the tenants Jim lived withThompson because he was a kind- of ahead man Of course Jim had to talkwith Sarah a good deal in the naturalcourse of things for they was togethera lot every day but so far as anybodyknows he never said any more than hewas obliged to But every day hethought she was a little nicer than hedid the day before I spose if I waswritin a novel about it Id say he wasin love with her and my wife she wasa girl then and was engaged to marryme used to tell me that she thoughtSarah was in love with Jim She saidno girl would speak so short about afeller as Sarah did about Jim unlessshe liked bim well enough to marryhim I used to think that was kindof curious and I think so yetWell Sarah and Jim had been workin for old man Thompson about ayear before Jim ever said anything particular to her How he finally come tospeak out was about this wayThere was a professor of vocalmusic a feller that parted his hair inthe middle and put beeswax on hisinustache come to the Corners andheld singin school all winter He gotfive dollars a night once a week besideshalf of what they should take in at thedoor at a concert at thesend of thesingin school Jim didnt go to singinschool mostly cause he was so bashful Sarah didnt go neither for somereason or otherK J-1a ftXgnMW1 iAri VJ-around the barn and had gone to thehouse with a pail of milkf or the Thompsons own private use and he met Sarahin the kitchen starting the breakfastIt was not far from sunriseSarah said Jim Im no accountand I know it but if youll just dropthat breakfast work for about half anhour and get into my buggy Jim hadjust bought a bran new buggy and hada young horse of his own well drivedown to the elders and get married andcome right back and tell the folks wereman and wife

course I am said Jim but Imsuch a coward that if you dont sayyes right now Im afraid Ill never dareask you againBut Jim said Sarah think ofbein married without a weddin dressWhat do I care about a weddindress says Jim Come on or Ill getscared againBy this time Jim had got over hisbashf ulness a little bit and he stoodthere with a smile on his face that asSarah told my wife afterward madeher forget all about the weddin dressAll right Jim she says hitch upquickIt wasnt two minutes before theywas a sittin together in the buggy andJims three-year-old colt was a takinthem down to the elders

the skeptical of the truth of the statementSince tlhe city was lighted by thebig arc lights which are placed at thecorners of the principal streets and inthe- middle of some of the long block3many of the trees have been graduallydying The decay has been slow butthat is has been sure is perfectly truein the opinion of those who study treeswith care amd can note the changesin their physical health day by dayjust as a physician can notice the slowgrowth of disease in the human beingOf late the -decay has become markedso that it may be noticed by the laymanas well as the trained scientist Deadbramches may be noticed on many treesin various parts of the city near electricarc lights Most of the trees within1 15 feet of arc lights which have beenplaced in their present position morethan a year or two ago are dying rapidly and are neairly stripped to theirlowest branohes And then on theoiher branches the leaves have notbeen as plentiful as in the pastThe nearer the tree isto the lightthe greater the damage and the fasterthey decay under the influence of theelectric light but even those within ahundred feet of the arc lights feel theirinfluence although to a modified extentA

corresponding with botanistsin other cities and he finds that thesame decay of trees placed near electriclights is noticed in every city It isespecially evident in Montreal and Philadelphia the two best lighted cities onthe American continentThe trees begin to- lose- their leavesand the branches to gradually decayon top or on the side facing the lightsand gradually losing them downwardThe theory of botanists is that theinjury is due bo the faet that the lighthas the same effect that it would haveon a human being who was compelledto live constantly withrnt its glaire Timtrees are unable to

All Other His Prevention Is MucliBetter Than CoreLousiness is largely the result ofstinting feed and the neglect to groomproperly Stock kept in a thriftygrowing condition ar rarely if everinfested by these pests unless theycome in contact with animals that areinfested But one lousy animal running with other stock will soon communicate the lice to all When the insectsence get a start they multiply so rapidly that in a short time the animal isfairly alive with them and is kept inperfect torment It is next to impossible to get a lousy animal info a thriftycondition until the lice are gotten rid ofStock that have to lie out exposed tocold and storms and are ill fed are almost certain to become infested this isso much the case that it seems thatpoor condition breeds liceAs with all other ills to which stockis liable prevention is much better thancure Feeding well giving clean comfortable quarters with proper groomng so as to keep the skin clean wiUkeep lice from getting a startOne of the best if not the best rf medies is staves acre seeds thoroughlybruised and vinegar This lotion willnot only kill the lice but destroy thenests as well The staves acre spedsbrushed and made into an ointmentwith lard is also a good remedy It willbe a good plan fco repeat the applicationin ten days or two weeks especially ifthe animals are badly affectedIn mild caes common obaccosteeped in water and sponged over theskin will rid the animal of lice Stillanother remedy is to take one ounce oltobacco two ounces of ground whitehellebore with about two pints and ahalf of vinegar boil all well togetherstrain and then sponge the animalswith itFeeding sulphur is also a good uid inridding animals of lice The objectionto it is that if while it is in the systemthe animal should get wet considerableinjury may resultThe quarters should be thoroughlycleansed up and whitewashed It willhelp if carbolic acid is added to thewhitewash Generally it will pay torepeat the whitewash in a week or tendaysWhen stock have been allowed to runtogether if a portion of them show thatthey are infested with these pests it isbest to treat all of them St Louis EepublicSTOCK FARM BARNA Flan That Has

said a young professional man who has just had an experience deliver me from the matchmaker I feel myself competent tostruggle with most of the ills of lifeI have built up a good business in thefaee of what seemed impossible obstacles and have maintained my standingand position mental morally physically socially and financially and havelooked after members of my family whowere unable to look after themselvesAnd all of this undertaking hasnt beenhalf so trying and perplexing as theefforts of my friends to find me a wifeand the irritation incident to my refusalto accept the young woman when shewas f oundv and placed as a temptingbait before my eyes I have quarreledwith some of my boon companions hadunpleasantnesses with a number of myclosest friends and have indulged in infelicities domestic and otherwise whenexasperated and hurried past furtherendurance I have gently indicated tothe members of my family and othersthat a little light mental gymnastics inthe way of minding their own businesswould be of untold benefit to their intellects and a blessing unspeakable tGme And then there have been sharpwords and tears and reproaches and 1have been made to appear ungratefuland unappreciative because I reallvwouldnt see what was best for meAs if a man who has reached the age oi40 years and has taken care of himselfat least half of that time isnt capableof judging even the least little bit ofwhat is good for him In the firstplace I am not specially anxious tamarrv and in the second I want tomake my own selection unhamperedand unbiased by the viewrs of anybodyelse Havent I got to live with her7And isnt my interest in the matter altogether ahead of that of anyone else 1It seems so to me and yet people willjersist in forcing upon my attentionladies whom I would under no circumstances think of for a moment in sucha relation xOne of my best friends a lady inwhose family I have for years been almost as much at home as in my owndwelling made up a little party a fewmonths ago for a weeks trip throughthe Adirondacks When everythingwas settled indeed just as we wereabout to start I learned for the firsttime that my special comrade was ai young woman to whom I had shownsome attention the season before butwhose intimate acquaintance I haddropped for reasons not at all reflecting upon her but simply because I wasjust a little weary ot some of her peculiarities For a moment I was inclined to give up the outing the moreso as my friend was fully aware of myfeelings toward the young woman butdid not in the least sympathize withthem She liked her and determined tothrow us together and literally force aproposaL Indeed I afterward learnedthat she had said she would have us engaged before we were back againWell the long and short of it was wewere not only engaged but such desperate efforts were made to put me ini position where I could not in common reason refuse to propose to thegirl that I was thoroughly disgustedand havent seen my friends since ourlittle journey nded And I care verylittle if we never meet again Matchmakers have need of the greatest skilland adroitness in order to avoid bungling And such skill is possessed byvery few persons in this meddlesomeworld It therefore behooves the average individual to be very wary of tryingto force the inclinations of those between whom they desire to establishmatrimonial alliances Love is easilyled but never driven a fact that a greatmany would be match makers never-seem to realize N Y LedgerWORUDS BOOK PRODUCTIONInteresting Bat Faulty Fisrofes Securedfrom a French SourceA French authority gives some interesting figures as to the annual production of books In 1895 according tothis statement 6516 new books andnew editions were issued in Great Britain 5469 in the United States 23607 inGermany 12495 in France and 9437 inItaly These are remarkable figuresbut before any deductions are madefrom them it Tvould be desirable to havesome further information as to the manner in wihich the books have been compiled Does anyone seriously supposethat more books are printed and published in Italy than in the UnitedStates The fact is that the bibliographical methods of the countriesnamed are -so dissimilar that accuratecomparison is impossible The lists ofpublications given in the British tradejournals axe notoriously incompleteProbably theyr include all that is important from the booksellers point ofview but they take little or no accountof the analogues of academical dissertations reprints of imagazine articlestrifles printed xex nozze and a varietyof other

schools and congenial neighbors Besides he was old and beginning to bef eeble But he felt that therewas awaiting him a broad field unplowed and ready for spiritual cultivationHe had meant to go into this homemissionary work years before but hiswife had persuaded him to wait untiltheir daughter had finished her education at an eastern college Now the opportunity had arrived and with aneagerness like that of youth he left acommunity that as he expressed ithad been for generations preached todeath in order to go to a people begging to be preached to lifeThere in the middle west the familybuilt a small cabin of three rooms anda lean to for the kitchen No -treesprotected them from the burning sunin summer or the fierce hurricanes inwinter The country was new Therewere no roads Their nearest neighborwas six miles away across the prairieand one Sunday the good man afterpreaching to an audience of 12 persons several miles from his home waslost in a blizzard in endeavoring to return to it From the effects of this exposure he died and his wife soon followed himThe daughter 20 years of age wasleft alone What was she to- doShould she pack up and return to thecomfortable east or stay and fight itout in the pioneer west She decided tostay and continue her fathers workShe went out upon the vast prairie toteach Most of the settlers there wereNorwegians and in a little two roomedhouse occupied by a large family sheent to board so that she might learnthe language But the food was sopoor that she became ill Finally shesecured the position of principal in asmall struggling college Here her surroundings were pleasant but the trustees could not pay her salary and afterthree years she went back to the prairieThis time she boarded with a kindbut ignorant Irish family During thewinter the mother died leaving twolittle girls to care for a household ofmen Here the teacher found her mission in lifeShe taught those girls how to workShe helped them to cook to sewT tomake their own clothes to make thehome cheerful and sweet She madeherself an elder sister to the two Sheshared their whole life She mendedwith them baked with them made butter with them milked with them andendured the hay field with them Soonthe two sisters became noted for theirgentleness consideration and excellent home qualities Wherever theywent they carried a spirit of helpfulness and an electric ray of cheerfulnessBut the world never knew of thesacrifice of the ministers daughterwho spent some of the best years ofher life in dreary hardship in order tomake the lives of two other

isboth a gilded palace and a mine of goldIt exeroises a strange fascination uponthe poor country bumpkins who havejust enough to pay for a drink but thedude coming out of a theater the country greenhorn the fashionable snob andthe frequenter of the music halls are always to be found there It is amongthese that the barmaidshunt for a husband If there is one class of Londonsociety more stupid than another it isthat one which includes the frequentersof the public houses With a pipe in hismouth and a glass of beer or whisky infront of him the young Englishmandressed -in fashionable style with aslight and elegant figure and regularfeatures remains standing for more thanan hour paying pretty little complimentsto one or several of these ladiesThe barmaid judges her customersby the cut of their clothes If you wantto attract her attention you must present yourself with a silk hat and ahandsome cane in your hand and a suitcut in the latest fashion The high hatis de rigueur Without that there is nopossible chance of successIt was not without difficulty that Imanaged to get an interview with oneof these young ladies whose intelligencewas equal to her beauty At first I wasastonished at finding so much intelligence in an English girl but I learnedthat she was Irish and that explainedthe mystery Her father was dead andher mother was left without resourcesSo she was determined to come to London and look for a husband by posingbehind a bar in PiccadillyI was hardly more than three dayshere she said with an amiable androguish air when I understood why itwas that so many pretty English girlsdont get husbands When they arebeautiful they are generally stupidWhen they are intelligent they are coldmasculine and ugly Englishmen travela great deal and meet in their ramblingsthrough the world very many sprightlywomen and they do not care for prettygirls who donfrknow how- to chat withthemBut in this mixture that comes hereto drink and chat I said how do youdistinguish the men of the world fromthe othersI recognize them by three thingsshe said boldly 6by their figure bytheir clothes and by their complexionFor the most part they are tall and thindressed in the latest fashion and have acomplexion more or less bronzed Thislast trait is the surest sign Seeing thatI looked astonished she addeding can be more simple An Englishgentleman if he has a fortune passesthree fourths of his time hunting andin other open air exercise The chapswho remain always in London have apaler and more delicate complexionand moreover the expression of theirfaces is quite different from that of theothersNoticing with what attention I waslistening to her she continued Thegentlemen that I refer to have nothingelegant about them except their clothesfor their conversation laoks noveltyHow can a man who understands nothing but hunting and cricket interest anintelligent woman The conversationthat goes on here in the name of witmakes me tired but these gentlemen arethe easiest of all to deceive They aregreat big children in everything exceptsport and politicsBut you are always engaged Isaid and it is difficult to get an opportunity to chat with you You muBt already have had several offers of marriagev I have been only one month hereand I have already had three Twowere from very rioh sportsmen butriches alone wont do for me What Iam after she added laughing is atitle You know I must have a titleAt this rrioment the play in one ofthe neighboring theaters was over andthe public house was invaded by acrowd of men more or less stylish
