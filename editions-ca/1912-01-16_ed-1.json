Pneumonia in Stvine.
Just at this season of the year Ken-
tucky is thickly scattered with a fata
disease, in hogs. This disease in a,
majority of casesns hog cholera, but
tnere have been many applications for
anti-hog cholera serum where upon in-
vestigat ion we found it was not hog
cholera but pneumonia. Pneumonia in
swine is a very common disease, and
during the winter months especially
is very prevalent, and one should be
able to distinguish between the .pri
mary inflammation in the lobes,
lobules and connective tissues of the
lungs pneumonia and hog cholera,
which frequently shows a secondary
pneumonia in combination with lesions
well indicative of hog cholera. A
differential diagnosis of' these two
diseases in swine is not always possible
before death, and a ostmortem is
therefore necessary. It is true that in
hog cholera pneumonia often exists, but
always as secondary pneumonia; .how
ever pneumonia may occur alone as a
primary infection.
In pneumonia congested areas are
found in the lungs," sometimes of a
bright red tinge but often of a dark
grayish red. In soma places they are
black with- pockets of pus (Gangre
neus). This latter condition is found
in secondary pneumonia, consequent
uponxholera, as well as invprimary
pneumonia. Where cholera exists the
lung hemorrhages are present also in,
the form of small pin-point hemor
rhages. Also in this case the cholera
lesions are prominently developed in
the alimentary tract. These points
swrve to distinguish the two conditions,
whether existing alone or simultane
ously. When the two exist together
the pneumonia is secondary and con
tracted after the cholera has lowered
the vitality.
Pneumonia in swine passes though
the same stages as in other demestic
aniamls and in man, accopmanied by
sympthoms practically the same, if
correctly interpreted. Mechanical
pneumonia is irequent in nogs ana 13
caused by direct irritition, such as
medicinal liquids in the form of
drenches which lodge in he lung tis
sues ; by dust and dirt constantly in
haled from dusty sleeping quarters
ny external wounds or portions of
fractured ribs penetrating the lung
tissue ; irora housing in ill ventilated
stanies, necessitating the constanat
inhalation of foul air, which is in
sumcient in oxygen to nourish the
body and results in pulmonary stag
nation and congestion. The animal ex
hibits a chill, often passing unnoticed,
followed by fever, which is indicated
oy dullness ana drowsiness ; increased
breathing and dry cough, with almost
complete loss of appetite. Many cases
in the early stages can be checked by

The treatment for pneumonia should
in the fhst place be prevention by re
moving tne cause, which is fremipntlv
aue to exposure and chancreahiA
matic conditions. During the earlv

Winter and Saturday morning thr
coldest day of the present season wad
recorded w hen the mercury went to a
noint between twelve and fifteen de
grees Deiow zero as indicated by
various thermometers throughout the

The heavy snow which fell Thursday
night covered the ground to a depth of
seven inches on the level and in many
places drifted to a depth of two feet.
Roads leading to this city from out, in
the county were rendered almost im
passable and the streets were in such
condition from the heavy snow fall
that the city hands were busily em
ployed all of Friday with teams in
clearing the snow off the sidewalks
and making paths for pedestrians.
Saturday morning the coldest weath
er of winter prevailed occasioning
much suffering and continued through
out the dav. Sunday a rising tempera
ture afforded some relief, and the
mercury in some places reached the
freezing point, only to be sent down
ward again by a cold wave Sunday
night, and yesterday hovered around
the twelve degree mark. The city
hands were engaged yesterday with
the street sweeper in removing the
snow from the gutters.
The weather indications for today
point to a slight relief from the pres
ent situation and it is to the effect
that today will be fair with a slowly
rising te'raparature.

Human Blood as Printer's Ink.
It is said that Faust carried a mm
ber of his "Mazarine" Bibles, so call
ed because a copy came first to the
knowledge of modern booklovers from
the library of Cardinal Mazarin, to
Paris about 1455-56 and suld one to the
king for seven hundred crowns, about
$840 and another to the archbishop of
Paris for six hundred crowns, say S720.
On comparing their purchases they
wondered at the exquisite accuracy
and uniformity of the text, and on
learning that other copies had been
sold at from five hundred to six hun
dred crowns each, which on comparison
proved to ba exact duplicates, it was
considered impossible for merely
human skill to produce such master
pieces of penmanship. The red mis
used to rubricate the illumiated parts
wag also of auch brilliancy and "body"
that it was promptly suspected to have
been composed of human blood, an1
Faust wab apprehended on a charge of
sorcery, and only escaped the facots
and the stake by revealing his secret.
ihe tradition that Doctor Faust was a
magician who had sold his salvation to
the devil, probably arose from this
stury of which his competitors, the
copyists, took all the advantage poss
ible. It is toldof one medieval printer
that, having been set to work upon a
geometrical work in which various fig
ures were inserted, he became convinc
ed that he was making a book of
magic which had been composed under
tne direct inspiration ot tne devil.
Thereupon he .remonstrated with his
employer and told him that he could
not consent to imperil his salvation bv
finishing his task. His master insisted
upon his continuing his work, but in
spite of ridicule and argument, the
poor fellow became so agitated that he
fell sick and died in the belief that
his misfortunes were due to the fact
tnat he had taken part in an unholy
and illegal enterprise. "The Printer
