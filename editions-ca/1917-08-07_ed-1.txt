The vote seems toshow that the party is well together,and that there will be absolutely nodisgruntled Democrats after the election. The results were known early,and everybody praised the work ofthe officials who conducted the election, and praised the speed withwhich the returns were made up andsent in. The election figures hadbeen practically completed by seveno'clock Saturday night, which madea record for fast work with a bigvote to tabulate. The work was alsoas thorough as it was speedy.The new primary law, tested outhere for the first time, met with general favor. The time saved by having the names of candidates havingno opposition not appear on the ballot was one of the big factors in getting the returns in early.

Fora few dimes they secure these namesfrom the "matrimonial bureau," always managed by a bunch of sharkswho wax rich at the expense of thelovelorn and the really gullible. Butnow Uncle Sam has taken a hand.He did so after discovering that anumber of the "bureaus" are sellingto such women as desire "gentlemen correspondents" the names ofconvicts in the State penitentiaries.Recent investigations show thatscores of women throughout thecountry are now carrying on ardentlove-snaking by mail with prison"birds. The writer knows personallyof one Paris man who engaged ina correspondence with a "Masoncounty girl" only to find in the endthat the "girl" was a negro cook inthe family of a Maysville man.Har!The "matrimonial bureau" may beinnocent enough, but these revelations, vouched for by the secret service men, are enough to warranttheir abolishment. This can easilyand quickly be accomplished by refusing them the use of the UnitedStates mails. We do not believethere is a lovesick girl in Paris, beshe honorable and all that sheclaims to be in her "matrimonial ad,"but who could find just as good a"sould mate" right here at home asany "matrimonial bureau" could findfor her. And if- there is a man inBourbon county so ostracised as tohave to resort to one of these bureaus for someone to "court" heought to move into a neighborhoodwhere he isn't so well known.With as good and as cheap a paperin Bourbon county as THE BOURBON NEWS we can't understand whysome Paris people will wear out aperfectly good pair of shoes runningto their neighbors to borrow an inferior paper. You'll hear them ay,"Oh, there's never anything in thatold paper," but just let somethinghappen that may possibly be affecting their business or social interests,and how they hotfoot it over to aneighbor's to borrow THE NEWS.The subscription price remains ?2.00per year.1Trying Something New."Trying something new" is an activity of individuals not confined toany special field. There are peopleright here in Paris, for instance,who never remain members of onechurch for any length of time, although taking quite a good deal ofinterest in religious thought if notin religious living. We have others,, scattered all over Bourbon county,-who seem to stray after other medi-cine for fancied maladies,r There is no community without aCertain proportion of men and women of industrious habits who donot work long at one job. True,they are seldom idle, for even whilethey are learning the duties in oneposition they are searching for newemployment, and they seem to getVlong fairly well, too.But constant hunting for "someIng new" isn't bettering their condition any. Seldom do they quit onethimg to take up another that paysjaofe money. Their sole desireseems Ho be to get ofC at a tangentand wind up in a new job, with allkinds of. reasons for doing so andwith all kinds of arguments thatthey have 'bettered themselves.'In the religious field you can findministers who have occupied pulpitsin almost every denomination, andin the political field you can findmen who have changed politics onan average of every four years sincethey first got the right of suffrage.Why, no one seems to know, unlessit is that human nature has equippedthem with that great and inexplainable desire to "try something new."There are a few instances in whichthis class of people have succeededin life. But there are vastly morecases wherein the Bourbon countyman who early in life became satisfied and left "something new" alone,won out.It would be a much better and amuch safer Paris if the city ordinances were so enforced that thespeedomaniacs wouldn't think ofleaving home without putting a wadof bail money in the hind pocketsof their trousers.Ki IS "WILL BROCADES BE WORN?A fashion reporter who was atthe remarkably successful fabric exposition recently held in Lyons,France, gives a bit of most interesting news concerning the introduction of brocade. It is this: Thatthe most exquisite brocade with anunusual design has already beenmade at Lyons for Mme. Poincare,the wife of the President of theFrench Republic, to be worn whenpeace is declared.This brocade is closely guardedand its design is not allowed to becopied. Whatever celebrationFrance expects to have when peaceis declared will be the circumstancethat will unlock the case where thisbrocade is kept. Mme. Poincairewill receive it as a gift from Lyonsand some great dressmaker willprepare it.This piece of cloth is not the onlyevidence of what the manufacturers of Lyons believe to be possiblynear. Literally, a half mile or so ofgold and silver brocade has. beenwoven and is now held in reservefor the celebration of peace. Thisweaving represents the very highestpinnacle of the craftmanship of themaster weavers of Lyons.It is said in exclusive circles thatthe purchase of all of this brocadehas been arranged for by dressmakers and individuals of power andprestige in Paris.IS P3 S3KENTUCKY TROOPS' WILL NOTLEAVE UNTIL SEPTEMBER.Camp Shelby, at Hattiesburg, Miss.,where the National Guard of Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginiawill receive final training for warservice, is not likely to be ready until September 1.

The corn cropcontinues to represent the brightestprospect on the farmer's horizon. ItI, has made a wonderful growth in thepast week.The oats crop is about the average. One grower, Mr. J. T. Osborne,who farms on the Sam Williamsplace, near Paris, reports a yield offorty bushels of oats to the acre,which is a record yield, fifteenbushels to the acre having beenconsidered the average yield in Kentucky. Vegetables from the home andhuckster gardens are plentiful andthere is little trouble in securingquantities for use now and for canning. The Government campaign tomake housewives realize the importance of canning all they possiblycan seem to be meeting with thehearty co-operation of the women ofBourbon county.Apples are plentiful, as promisedby indications earlier in the season.Peaches are scarce and of poor qualtiy when obtained. Blackberries arebecoming more plentiful, but priceshave been but slightly reduced.Grass pasturage is short, and themilk supply is becoming diminishedas a result. Grazing cattle will become a problem unless pastures improve in a week or so. Hay cuttingbas progressed well during the pasLweek, owing to the fair weather.Clover and timothy will each makefair crops.q 153 13NAVY- POSTERS DISPLAY ATCOUNTY PAIRS.The United States Navy PublicityBureau, Commander K. M. Bennett,U. S. N., officer in charge, has justcompleted an arrangement by whichan attractive display of recruitingposters will be officially made at allof the State and county fairs in theUnited States. More than twothousand fair secretaries and managers have applied to the Bureau forplans and specifications for the erection of a Navy billboard on theirgrounds.To each of these has been sent detailed plans, prepared by an architect, a picture of a completed boardand three of the newest posters issued by this Bureau. A sample displayboard is now on exhibition alongsidethe U. S. S. Recruit in Union Square,New York.. Prior to this the Publicity Bureau also made arrangementsby which all of the amusement parksand pleasure grounds throughout thecountry were" similarly billed.All of this has been carried out inan effort to especially reach theyoung men of the country who haveresponded most readily to the call ofthe Navy. In this work the Bureauhas had the co-operation of Charlesand John Ringling, of Ringling.Bros.,who have had all of the bill-posterscovering the country make a distribution of Navy posters with theirown. Both circuses are also carrying recruiting tents which are takencharge of by Navy recruiting officerswherever the shows appear.There is more Catarrh in this section of the country than all otherdiseases put together, and for years itwas supposed to be incurable Doctors prescribed local remedies, andby constantly failing to cure withlocal treatment, pronounced it incurable. Catarrh is a local disease,greatly influenced by consitutionalconditions and therefore requiringconstitutional treatment. Hall'sCatarrh Medicine, manufacturedt by F. J.

In the same timethe outside of the average balancetravels 7,500 miles. Yet despite thisastonishing distance traveled by theordinary watch, the amount of powerconsumed is trifling, states the Popular Science Monthly. One horsepoweris sufficient to run 270,000,000watches. This is probably all thewatches that are in existence. But ifthere should be more there would beenough power left in the one horsepower to run an additional thousandwatches or so.3 3 EQASK ANYONE WHO HAS USED IT.There are families who always aimto keep a bottle of Chamberlain'sColic and Diarrhoea Remedy in thehouse for use in case it is needed, andfind that it is not only a good investment but saves them no end of suffering.

WoundedIn Action.By Sergeint Alexander McClintock,D. C. M., 87th Oversets Batt.,Canadian Gren. GuardsCopyright, 1917, by the Bell Syndicate, Inc.Sergeant McClintock, an Americanooy of Lexington Ky., has seen servicein France, was decorated for bravery,wounded and invalided home. He istelling his story, a thrilling one, andthis is the fifth article of the series. Inthe preceding ones he described how hereached the front, fighting in Belgium,and then the great preparations for theSomme battle. In this installment hetells of conditions and describes firsthand the fighting in that greatest of allbattles.OTJR high command apparentlymeant to make a sure thing ofthe general assault upon the Begina trench, in which we were to participate. Three times the order to "goover the top" was countermanded. Theassault was first planned for Oct. 19.Then the date was changed to the 20th.Finally, at 12:10 noon of Oct. 21, wewent. It was the first general assaultwe had taken part in. and we were inIt Seemed Almost Certain Death toStart Over In Daylight.a highly nervous state. I'll admitthat.It seemed almost certain death tostart over in broad daylight, yet, asit turned out, the crossing of No Man'sLand was accomplished rather moreeasily than in our night raids. Ourbattalion was on the extreme right ofthe line, and that added materially toour difliculties, first by compelling usto advance through mud so deep thatsome of our men sank to their hips init and, feecond, by giving us the hottestlittle spot in France to hold later.. I was in charge of the second"wave," or assault line. This is calledthe "mopping up" wave, because thebusiness of the men composing it isthoroughly to bomb out a positioncrossed by the first wave, to captureor kill all of the enemy remaining andto put the trench in a condition to bedefended against a counterattack byreversing the fire steps and throwingup parapets.Our artillery had given the Germanssuch a battering and the curtain firewhich our guns dropped just thirty toforty yards ahead of us was so powerful that we lost comparatively fewmen going over only those who wereknocked down by shells which the Germans landed among us through ourbarrage. They never caught us withtheir machine gun sweeping until weneared their trenches. Then a goodmany 'of our men began to drop, butwe were In their front trench beforethey could cut us up anywhere near jcomnletelv. Goin over I was struck iby shell fragments on the hand andleg, but the wounds were not severeenough to stop me. In fact, I did notknow that I had been wounded untilI felt blood running into my shoe.Then I discovered the cut in my leg.but saw that it was quite shallow .andthat no artery of importance had beeniamaged. So I went on.I had the familiar feeling of nervousness and physical shrinking and nauseajat the beginning of this fight, but bythe time we were halfway across NoManlsLiind I had my nerve back.The Thrill and the Hell ofthe Trenches, Describedby an American Boy.Sergeant Alexander McClintock of Lexington, Ky., and the Canadian Army HuGripping Tale That Every American WillBead, For He Tells the Pacts Unadorned. Wounded, a Distinguished ConductMedal Man, He Was Invalided Home,but Is Going "Out There" Again to FightFor Tlncle Sam and His Allies. An laspiring, Interesting, Personal Narrative,Full of the Spirit and Atmosphere of theTrenches.After I had been hit I remember feeling relieved that I hadn't been hurtenough to keep me from going on withthe men. I'm not trying to make myself out a hero. I'm just trying to tellyou how an ordinary man's mindworks under the stress of fighting andthe danger of sudden death. Thereare some queer things in the psychology of battle. For instance, when wehad got into the German trench andwere holding it against the mostvigorous counterattacks the thoughtwhich was persistently uppermost inmy mind was that I had lost the address of a girl in London along withsome papers which I had thrown awayjust before we started over and whichI should certainly never be able to findagain.Hold Eegina Trench at Last.The Reglna trench had been takenand lost three times by the British.We took it that day and held it. Wewent into action with 1,500 men of allranks and same out with 000.I have said that because we were onthe extreme right of the line we hadthe hottest little spot in France tohold for awhile. Tou see, we had toinstitute a double defensive, as wehad the Germans on our front and onour flank, the whole length of thetrench to the right of us being stillheld by the Germans. There we hadto form a "block," massing our bombers behind a barricade which was onlyfifteen yards from the barricade behind which the Germans were fighting.Our flank and the German flank werein contact as fiery as that of two livewire ends. And meanwhile the Fritzestried to rush us on our front with nineseparate counterattacks. Only one ofthem got up close to us,1 and we wentout and stopped that with the bayonet.Behind our block barricade there wasthe nearest approach to an actual fighting hell that I had seen.And yet a man who was in the midstof it from beginning to end came outwithout a scratch. He was a tall chapnamed Hunter. For twenty-four hours,without interruption, he threw German"eggshell" bombs from a position atthe center of our barricade. He neverstopped except to light a cigarette oryell for some one to bring him more' bombs from Fritz's captured store-house. He projected a regular curtainj of fire of his own. I've no doubt theI Germans reported he was a couple ofplatoons, working in alternate reliefs.He was awarded the D. C. M. for hisservices in that fight, and, though, asI said, he was unwounded, half the' men around him were killed, and his1 nerves finished in such condition thathe had to be sent back to England.The Big Blunder and What It Cost.One of the great tragedies of the warresulted from a bit of carelessnesswhen a couple of days later the effortwas made to extend our grip beyondthe spot which we took in that firstfight. Plans had been made for theForty-fourth battalion of the TenthCanadian brigade to take by assaultthe trench section extending to theright from the point where we had established the "block" on our flank. Thehour for the attack had been fixed.Then headquarters sent out a countermanding order. Something wasn'tquite ready.The orders were sent by runners, asall confidential orders must be. Telephones are of no avail any more, asboth our people and the Germans havean apparatus which needs only to beattached to a metal spike in the groundto "pick up" every telephone messagewithin a radius of three miles. Whentelephones are used for anything important messages are sent In code.But for any vitally important communication which might cost seriouslosses, if misunderstood, old style runners are used, just as they were in thedays when the field telephone was unheard of. It is the rule to dispatch twoor three runners by different routes sothat one at least will be certain to arrive. In the case of the countermanding of the order for the Fourty-fourthbattalion to assault the German posi-tion ou our flanb some officer at uead.quarters thought that one messengerto the lieutenant colonel commandingthe Forty-fourth- would be sufficient.Tfoe messenger was killed by a chanceshot, and his message was undelivered.The Forty-fourth, in ignorance, of thechange of plan, "went over.' " Therewas no barrage fire to protect them,and their valiant effort was' simply awholesale suicide. Six hundred out of800 men were on the ground in twoand a half minutes. The battalion wassimply wiped out. Several officerswere court martialed as a result, ofthis terrible blunder.We had gone into the Germantrenches at a little after noon on Saturday. On Sunday night at about 10'clock we were relieyed. The reliefforce, bad to come in overland, andFHE BOURBONthey had a ?ood many casualties enroute. They found us as comfortableas bug in a tug except for the infernal and continuous bombing at ourflank barricade. The Germans hadconcluded that it was useless to tryjtodrive us out. About one-fourth of theGOO of us who were still on their feetwere holding the sentry posts, and theremainder of the 000 were havingbanquets in the German dugouts, whichwere stocked up like delicatessen shopswith sausages, fine canned foods, champagne and beer. If we had only hada few ladies with us we could havehad a real party.I got so happily interested in thespread In our particular dugout that Iforgot about my wound until some onereminded me tjiat orders required meto hunt up a dressing station and getan anti-tetanus injection. The Tommies like to take a German trench, because if the Fritzes have to movequickly, as they usually do, we alwaysfind sausage, beer and champagne, awelcome change from bully beef. Icould never learn to like their bread,however.After this fight I was sent,' withother slightly wounded men, for aweek's rest at the casualty station atContay. I rejoined my battalion atthe end of the week. From Oct. 21 toNov. 18 we were in and out of thefront trenches several times for dutytours of forty-eight hours each, butwere in no important action. At 6:10on the morning of Nov. 18, a bitter cold day, we "went over" to takethe Desire and also the Desire supporttrenches. These were the names giventhese trenches. We started from theleft of our old position, and our advance was 'between Thiepval andPozleres, opposite Grandecourt.There was the usual artillery preparation and careful organization forthe attack. I was again in charge ofthe "mopping up" wave, numbering200 men and consisting mostly ofbombers. It may seem strange to youthat a noncommissioned officer shouldhave so important an assignment, butsometimes in this war privates havebeen in charge of companies numbering 250 men, and I know of a casewhere a lance corporal was temporarily in command of an entire battalion.It happened on this dav that, while Iwas in chame of tho. second wave. T 7did not go over with them. At the lastmoment I was given a special duty byMajor John Lewis, formerly managing editor of the Montreal Star andone of the bravest soldiers I everknew, as well as the best beloved manIn our battalion.The 'Troublesome Machine Gun."McClintock," said he, "I don't wishto send you to any special hazard, and,so far as that goes, we're all going toget more or less of a dusting, but Iwant to put that machine gun whichhas been giving us so much troubleout of action."I knew very well the machine gunhe meant. It was in a concrete 'emplacement, walled and roofed, and thedevils in charge of it seemed to be descendants of William Tell and theprophet Isaiah. They always knewwhat was coming and had their gunaccurately trained on it before it came."If you are willing," said MajorLewis, "I wish you to select twentyfive from the company and go afterthat gun the minute the order comesto advance. Use your own judgmentabout the men and the plan for takingthe gun position. Will you go?""I sure will," I answered. "I'll goand pick out the men right away. Ithink we can make those fellows shutup shop over there.""Good boy!" he said. "You'll try, allright."I started away. He called me back."This is going to be a bit hot, McClintock,' he said, taking my hand."I wish you luck, old fellow you andthe rest of them." In the trenchesthey always, wish, you the best of luckwhen they hand you a particularlytough job. ,I thanked him and wished him thesame. I never saw him again. Hewas killed in action within two hours"This is going to be a bit hot, McClintock." after our conversation. Both he andmy pal Macfarlane were shot downdead that morning.When they called for volunteers togo with me in discharge of Major Lewis' order the entire company responded.I picked out twenty-five men, twelvebayonet men and -thirteen bombers.They agreed to my plan, which wasto get within twenty-five yards of thegun emplacement before attacking, toplace no dependence on rifle fire, butto bomb them out and take the position with the ba3Tonet. We followedlhat plan and took the emplacementuuicker than we had expected to do.but there were only two of us leftwhen we got therePrivate Godsall,So. 177,063, and myself. All the restof the twenty-five were dead or downme emplacement was iieta ny eleven.T HNKWS, PARIS, KY.Gwrmanp. Two only were left stand -lug when w got in.

I reached him before Godsalland bayoneted him.

He never took his eyesoff of us even to look at his officer, lying at his feet. As we moved downthe trench he followed us, still holding his hands up and repeating, "Mercy,karaerad!" At the next trench anglewe took five more prisoners, and asGodsall had been slightly wounded inthe arm I turned the captives over tohim and ordered him to take them tothe rear. Just then the men of oursecond wave came over the parapetlike a lot of hurdlers. In five minuteswe had taken the rest of the Germansin the trench section prisoners, had reversed the fire steps and had turnedtheir own machine gun against thoseof their retreating companies that wecould catch sight of.As we could do nothing more here,I gave orders to advance and re-enforcethe front line. Our way ledacross a field furrowed with shell holesand spotted with bursting shells. Not la man hesitated. We were winning.That was all we knew or cared toknow. We wanted to make it a certainty for our fellows who had goneahead. As wre were proceeding towardthe German reserve trench I saw fourof our men, apparently unwounded, lying in a shell hole. ,1 stopped to askthem what they were doing there. AsI spoke I held my German rifle andbayonet at the position of "guard," thetip of the bayonet advanced, aboutshoulder high. I didn't get their answer, for before they could reply Ifelt a sensation as if some one hadthrown a lump of hard clay and struckme on the hip, and forthwith I tumbled in on top of the four, almostplunging my bayonet into one of them,a private named Williams.McClintock Badly Wounded."Well, now you know what's thematter with us," said Williams. "Wedidn't fall in, but we crawled in."They had all been slightly wounded.I had twenty-two pieces of shrapneland some shell fragments imbedded inmy left leg between the hip and theknee. I followed the usual custom ofthe soldier who has "got it." The firstthing I did was to light a "fag" (cigarette), and the next thing was to. investigate and determine if I was indanger of bleeding to death. Therewasn't much doubt about that. Arterial blood was spurting from two ofthe wounds, which were revealedwhen the other men in the hole helpedme to cut off my breeches. With theiraid I managed to stop the hemorrhageby improvising tourniquets with ragsand bayonets. One I placed as highup as possible on the thigh and theother just below the knee. Then weall smoked another "fag" and lay therelistening to the big shells going overand the shrapnel bursting near us. Itwas quite a concert too. We discussedwhat we ought to do, and finally Isaid:"Here, you fellows can walk, and Ican't. Furthermore, you're not able tocarry me because you've got about allany of you can do to navigate alone.It doesn't look as if it's going to beany better here very soon. You allproceed to the rear, and if you can getsome one to come after me I'll beobliged to you."They accepted the proposition because it was good advice, and, besides,it was orders. I was their superiorofficer. And what happened rightafter that confirmed me forever in- myearly, Kentucky bred conviction thatthere is a great deal in luck. Theylouldu't have traveled more than fifty;-ards from the shell hole when thej-.hrlefc of a high explosive seemed toi ome rigluSdown out of, the sky intoSfK AfwJP1M!I Tumbled In on Top of the Four.1 uyears, and tlie dqronation wlilqji4n i' stoutly followed s'Jook the slantingjsides of the shell hole until dirt in littie dusty rivulets came trickling downupon me. Wounded as I wasI dragged myself up to the edge of the hole.There was no trace anywhere of thefour men who had just left me. Theyhave never been iieard of since. Theirbodies were never found. The bigshell must have fallen right amongthem and simply blown them to bits. ,It was about a quarter to 7 in themorning when I was hit. I lay in theshell hole until 2 in the afternoon, suffering more from thirst and cold, andhunger than from pain. I only hopedthe Germans wouldn't drive our menuack over me,At 2 o'clock a batch ofsixty prisoners came along under escort They were beiQg taken t0 therear under fire. The artillery bom-bardment was still practically undi-i minished. I asked for four of the' prisoners and made one of them get. out his rubber ground sheet, carriedaround his waist. They respondedwillingly and seemed most ready toI help me. I had a revolver (empty) andsome bombs in my pockets, but I hadno need to threaten them. They halfdragged me toward the rear.Carried to the Bear.It was a trip which was not withoutIncident. Every now and then wewould hear the shriek of an approaching "coal box," and then my prisonerstretcher bearers and I would tumble inone indiscriminate group into the nearest shell hole. If we did that once wedid it a half dozen times. After eachdive the four would patiently reorganize and arrange the improvised stretcher again, and we would proceed. Following every tumble, however, I wouldhave to tighten my tourniquets, and,despite all I could do, the hemorrhagefrom my wound continued to flVw soprofusely that I was beginning to feelvery dizzy and weak. On the way inI sighted our regimental dressing station and signed to my four bearers tocarry me toward it. I couldn't talkGerman. The station was in an oldGerman dugout. Major Gilday was atthe door. He laughed when he sawme with my own special ambulancedetail."Well, what do you want?" he asked."Most of all," I said, "I think I wanta drink of rum."He produced it for me instantly."Now," said he, "my advice to you isto keep on traveling. You've got a finespecial detail there to look after you.Make 'em carry you to Pozieres. Itlsonly five miles, and you'll make it allright. I've got this place loaded upfull, no stretcher bearers, no assistants,no adequate supply of bandages andmedicines and a lot of very bad casesvIf you want to get out of here in aweek just keep right on going now."As we continued toward the rear wewere the targets for a number of humorous remarks from men coming upto go into the fight."Give my regards to Blighty, ybulucky beggar," was the most frequentsaying."Bli' me," said one cockney Tommy,"there goes one o' tlT Canadians withan escort from the kaiser."Another man stopped and askedabout my wound."Good work," he said. "I'd like tohave a nice clean one like that myself." I noticed one of the prisoners grinning at some remark and asked him ifhe understood English. He hadn't spoken to me, though he had shown thegreatest readiness to help me."Certainly I understand English," hereplied, speaking the language perfectly. "I used to be a waiter at theKnickerbocker hotel in New York."That sounded like a, voice from home,and I wanted to hug him. I didn't.However, I can say for him he musthave been a good waiter. He gave megood service.Of the last stages of my trip to Pozieres I cannot tell anything, for I arrived unconscious from loss of blood.The last I remember was that the former waiter, evidently seeing that Iwas going out, asked me, to direct himhow to reach the field hospital stationat Pozieres and whom to ask for whenhe got there. I came back to consciousness in a clean hospital cot thenext morning.I realized as I lay on that cot I wasout of the modern hell for a time, andmy mind drifted back over the daysjust passed. Wounded men, grim reminders, were all about me, many ofthem worse off than I was. I had seenall kinds of bravery British officersclimbing calmly over the top with amonocle in their eyes and a cane intheir hands into almost certain death,like a man getting into a tub of waterwhere he knew he would get wet."Come on; let's go!" they woulddrawl. My respects to them.And also to the enemy. The Germanofficers fight to the last Few surrender. My hat off to them. And thedead brave Major Lewis and poorMacfarlane, my close comrades. Andonly the other day I read Lance Corporal Glass, the man I carried in afterour first bombing raid in Belgium, hadbeen killed in action in France.

For in the mountains of Western Maryland and Eastern West Virginia, across which Daniel took hishazardous way, the boys are stillmaking such. swings just for fun.And royal fun it is. The writer of 'this was driving through the mountains near the upper Potomac a fewweeks ago when he saw some enormous grapevines drooping sixty orseventy feet from the tops of thertrees. Swings made with ropes were-tame by comparison. But there wasno temptation to emulate Daniel by"letting loose at the end of the swing.It took pioneering nerve to do that.Green Peas Green BeansHead Lettuce TomatoesCucumbers OkraESS Plant CymlinsBlackberriesPeachesWatermelons CanteloupesCelerySTEAKS CHOPSROASTSTrtsfi Re4ls Fresh BreadFresh CakesEvery DayWILMOTH'Grocery Co.Phone 376MATRIMONIAL.BEWLAY GEDDES.The marriage of Miss ElizabethBrent Bewlay and Mr. JohnJDouglassGeddes, both prominent young society people of Lexington, was quietly solmenized at St. Peter's Episcopal church, in this city, late Saturday afternoon, the rector, Rev.
