Paris people testify to permanent cures.Mrs. J. W. Huffman, 115 N. MainStreet, Paris, Ky., says: "I gladlycorroborate the public statement 1gave in 1905 in which I made the factknown that I had used Doan's KidneyPills with satidfactory results. I hadsharp pains across my back and kidneys and at times was so miserablethat I could hardly attend to my work.Headaches and dizzy spells were alsocommon.

Thepeople of the whole civilized world areto be congratulated that after havingonce rejected it the men who had incharge the outline of the proposedtreaty inserted a clause providing forthe investigation of all questions, evenof those not submitted to arbitration.This is plainly the most important provision in the treaty. Other treatieshave contained exceptions which largely reduced their value as preventivesof war but now investigation is to bemade compulsory in every caso, eventhe so-called national honor i3 notmade the' basis of exception and warbecomes a remote possibility.It will be remembered that at thepeace conference in London five yearsago Mr. Bryan introduced a resolutiondemanding the investigation of all,., , . ., . .differences before the comencement ofwar. He had at that time the suppoi tof Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman andthe congress then in session representing 256 nations unanimously adoptedthe resolution. It was later indorsedby peace congresses in New York andin Scotland.i It is understood that the UnitedStates hah annoure:d its willingness tomake a similar treaty with France. Itought also make the offer to Germany,Japan and other nations.The world's peace is no longer adream; it is very nearly a gloriousfact.- Blessing to Farmers.A? Washington dispatch says- thatCongressman Cantrill sees in the Supreme Court decision in the StandardOil case a blessing to the tobaccogrowers, who can now form combinations to enaole them to get betterp. ices for their tobacco and othercrops, Mr. Cantrill has for years beentrying to get the Sherman Anti-TrustLaw amended so as to give farmersthis right which he says will not nowunder the court's decision h necessary. It is hardly probaDle now thatwe shall have any more of such prosecutions as those against the Grantcounty tobacco growers unless- itshould be discovered that some judgewill decide that such acts are in "unreasonable" restraint of trade."Comparison rlan is verymm m a rlji :.KENTUCKYJSIX MONTHSGEO.
