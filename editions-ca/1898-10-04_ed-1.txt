Art Useful HowIt Ik DoneThe decoration of wood by the application of beated irons is an art of longstanding and many interesting examples of old work are occasionally tobe found For a trifling sum a complete apparatus may be bought whichincludes a platinum point that is keptheated while the work is in progressnot by electricity as many Sunnosebut by fumes of benzine which is supplied by pressure on a rubber bellowsj which is connected by tubing to a bottle half filled with benzine When beginning the work the point should notbe heated in any flame but that of analcohol lamp Any other flame wouldbe liable tb smoke and ruin the pointIn burning outlines remember that tomake a broad firm Hue it is not necessary to press The lines are to bescorched not incised The point isheld and guided much in the same manlier as a drawing pencil but some littlepractice is needed o enable the workerto pass it smoothly and readily overthe wood the tendency of allbeing to allow it to rest and makedots No discouragement howeverluust be felt at this as with a littlepractice the manipulation will becomeeasy and the worker be able to makedark or light strokes at will Bold outlines and strongly burned backgroundscome out well on ordinary white wooden articles such as tables stools chairsbowls plates racks etc FlorenceFeiherston in Ladies Home JournalSalmon and LioI4er PieTake a small can each of

of the announcement of Fanny Hay wards engagement to Mr McLane nnd a fewweeks before the marriage RandolphMerriam had left Fort Sedgwick in comlAn-ratTHE BOURBON NEWS PAEIS KY TUESDAY OCTOBER 4 1898mand of a detachment of cavalrycorting a government survey to theMescalero range It was not his tourThe detail belonged to Harrison ayounger officer who had been saving upall winter for n two months leave anda chance to spend his savings at thegreat -exposition-at Chicago A relent-s coToncKwould allow himbecause it was hisuturn for field dutyand because so many officers wished togo to the fair that it was out of thequestion as to expect anjone to offer totake the detail for ham The detachment would be in the field at least threemonths possibly four Harrison consequently was the bluest man at Sedgwick and said more hard things aboutgovernment surveys and more improperthingsthan could well be recorded hereEverybody had been congratulatingMerriam on the final receipt of what thelawyers didnt scoop of his little legacy and for two weeks he had been ashappy as Harrison was miserableThen to the utter amaze- of everybodyjust the day before it was time for thecommand to start it was announcedthat Harrisons application for leavehad gone forward approved and thatMerriam had asked for and been granted the luxury of a three or four monthsjog through the roughest and most forbidding of mountain ranges He hadeven got the colonels permission to goahead and wait for the detachment atthe old mission on the Santa Clara andhad started late at night accompaniedonly by an orderly People couldnt believe their ears and the post commanderrejoiced in the possession- of a secreteven his wife couldnt coax out of himthe conscienceless crabbed oldcrank as one of his garrison not subject to court martial described himThe adjutant had to admit that Merriam had been closeted with the K Onearly half an hour and had lookedblack and blue both but no blacker nobluer when he came out than when hewent in No he did not think that anybody else had complained of Merriamsowinghimmoney He did not think anybody had bad a word to say against himThe old man had simply sent for the adjutant right after the interview and remarked Mr Blossom you can tellMr Harrison he ma submit that application for leave and Ill forward it approved Mr Merriam hasjny consentto take that escort in his stead Buthadnt he told anybody Didnt anybody know were the verv natural questions asked No Merriairis one intimate and cbum inhisregimentwasBillWhittakcr and Bill was away up atSanta Fe at Ie time a witness beiorea genernl crvrt martial Merriam was afrequent visiter at the Haynesters ard everybody knew taht in hisown regiment he had no warmer friendsthan Capt and Mrs Lawrence Hayneof the Riflers and Merriam had had along talk with Hayne before calling onthe colonel But no one who kneweither Havne or his charming wife everthought of trying to extract from tiheminformation as to other peoples personal affairs Old Buxton the dragoon-of-the-old-army-sortof a lieutenant colonel did try to pump the captainbut was most coolly and civilly snubbedfor his pains Buxton was a man Haynenever spoke to except in the mostformal way There had been sometrouble between them ever so long agowhen Hayne was a young second lieutenant and Bux the senior captain ofthe th cavalry The softening touchof time had effaced much of the bitterness of that old old story Hayne hadtwice been stationed at the same garrison with Buxton and found it awkwardto preserve the rule of nonintercoursewith a field officer who was frequentlyin command so he spoke respectfullyand courteously to his senior wheneverthey met but the courtesy was as coldand the meetings as rare as he couldmake them Bux however bore nomalice as he said and was quite readyto be magnanimous and forgive Haynefor what had transpired in the past butthen Buxton not Hayne had been theoffender Indeed Buxton was a pachyderm on whom snubs had little effectHe believed Hayne knew why Merriamhad asked for his most undesirable detail and so importuned him with eagerinquiry all to no purpose Harrisonblissfully wentt on to Chicago and Merriam out to the Mescalero and was nomore heard of or from for several weeksThen the news came that he was seriously ill with mountain fever at thecantonment on Catamount creek andBill Whittaker was hurried thither totake over the commandIn a week there came a letter fromhim to Capt Hayne and this was whatit saidI found the dear old boy convalescing but woefully limp and weakTremaine savs he was wild as a loonwhen the men brought him in Theysaw that he tvas burning with fever fordays and begged him to go to the cantonment for medical attention but hebade them mind their own businesand obstinately stuck to the work Thegentlemen of the survej soon saw txiathe was going flighty and later delirious and they took the responsibility oftelling the sergeant he must be sentthither They made a fore-and-aft litter by lashingsaplings together hitchedon a couple of pack mutes roped Rand v inside the thing and made a fourday march of it Luckily Tremainehad a capital medical officer and

MILITARY ROADIt Was Found in Puerto Rico andWas a Genuine Surprise toGen Roy StoneGen Roy Stone of Pennsylvaniawho is with the army In Puerto Eico isthe government good roads expertBefore the war he was officially engaged in advancing the interests ofthe good roads movement and wassent away with the army with a viewto bringing his expert knowledge tobear upon the problem of preparingthe highways for the transportationof our army suppliesThe condition of the so called roadsin Cuba was what might have been expected under Spanish administrationBut a delightful surprise awaited GenStone in Puerto Eico He was obligedto make a reconnoitering expeditioninto the mountains north of Ponceand in carrying out that purpose hefound a splendid military road builtby the Spaniards running up themountains to a height of 5000 feetpart of the way hewn out of solid rockand throughout displaying the finestengineering skill Up this fine highway the vehicles of the party of officers and correspondents were drawnby native ponies who went at a gallopNothing more creditable to theSpaniards has been found in Cuba orPuerto Bico during the war The excursion must have been especiallygratifying to Gen Stone and he maybe depended npon to make the American public acquainted with the factsregarding this piece of road engineering when he returnsOne of the incidents which markedthis reconnoisance wras the discoveryat the mountain town of Adjuntas ofa rich Englishman who had been thereover 50 years whose children spokeonly Spanish and French and who hadalmost forgotten his native speechHis delight over the coming of Englishspeaking visitors found expression ina cordial invitation to the party to3ine with him while the nativesshowed their gratification over theappearance of the Americans by hoisting flags and cheering the visitorsThe scenerj in the mountains northof Ponce is described as being less boldbut as beautiful as that of the AlpsEvidently after matters have beensettled down in Puerto

rvwTIRES FOR FARM USEExperience of an Eastern FarmerWhich Proves More Than Newspaper Arguments DoBroad tires on farm vehicles are coming slowly into use and but for theconservatism of the average farmertheir use would be much more common than now So far as yet appearsnothing is to be said againt them theonly objection being the cost of thechange But the cost cannot be greatwhile the advantages are so many thatit seems strange how little attention isgiven to the matterAmong the advantages are an easierdraft for the team and less wear andtear to the tire and the road bed Narrow tires have a less supporting surface by which to uphold the load andthat makes them cut into the groundwith more force and especially when itis soft Suppose the tire to be shapedlike the capital V everyone can seethat it would cut into the road hencethe narrower it is the greater is thistendency Prom this constant wear wehave an alternation of dust mud whenit rains and ruts in spring and fall inaddition to the wear and tear of theteam harness wagon and the oddsand ends of time lost for- repaiis toeverything in use When all the Hemsof cost are posted the sum will befound a very serious one to those towhom economy is importantIn hauling loads over the farm wherethere are no beaten roads or only apologies for them the waste is greatestIn farm operations it is often necessaryto drive over freshly plowed groundor only once or twice harrowed andnarrow tires make anything but a lightload impossible to stir except for a yodor two at a time The usual load drawnon a well beaten road will on plowedground wind the team in a few seconds or sink it to a depth impossibleto stir The ox cart with its broadtires is much more serviceable on suchland and that fact should teach farmers that the farm wagons should alsobe equipped with broad tires Thefarm wagon cannot be dispensed withbut the ox cart with its slowly moving team is going out of use and somefine day in the future will disappearexcept in sections where it is inconvenient or dangerous to use horsesIt i3 evidently a common idea that touse broad tires requires broad rimmedwheels in other words new wheels tomatch the width of the tires but thisis an error at least when the old rimsare in good condition The broadtires can be put on them just as theyare and no trouble follow I speakfrom a rather limited experience butin spite of that feel confident that 3am right Some three years since Ibought a new wheelbarrow with a narrow tire used it a month or two untilthe tire came off and then determinedto try a board tire three inches wideinstead of an inch and a half On buying the barrow I asked the dealer if abroad tire could not be used on it andhe said he thought not that on softground as the rim of the tire would extend over the felloe it would becomeloaded with earth and make troubleI failed to see the force of his reasoning and decided to ignore it The felloewas not one of the best and the blacksmith looked rather dubious when Itold him my plan Befor e he got thetire on he seemed to feel as I thoughtprofanely inclined but succeededafter he had unintentionally thoughjust as he expected chipped off apiece where the ends met It was notbolted firmly and after some monthsof use and shrinkage in hot weathercame off but was reset and firmlybolted by another blacksmith sincewhich it has done excellent serviceThe predicted difficulty has not beenrealized in the least though it hasoften been used on plowed or spadedearth with loads about as heaYy as arecarried on solid ground The narrowtire would not be replaced for theprice of the wheelbarrowWe are bound to have an improvedsystem of roads in then ear future andwith them broad tires will be a naturaladjunct to reduce the cost of keepingthe roads in repair The rapid wear oinarrow tires is soon apparent in therounded edges assumed because thefriction at the edges Is always thegreatest The moment the tire isbroadened the friction lessen andcould it be used at the width of a footor more the friction would be almostinfinitesimal With only broad tires onour roads Ave should have much lessdust than now and that would be again in comfort as well as in the costfor repairs With less dust Ave shouldhave less mud in Avet weather androads Avith a minimum of dust andmud Avould almost reach the idealstandard Philip Snyder in CountryGentlemanSugar

actual number of accidents that occur on countryroads is greater than the numberwhich happen in city thoroughfaresbut I take it this is due to the fact thatmore people cycle on country highAvays than

crimewould bo not manslaughter but murderIt appears froin Law Notes Londonthat Jbhe accused was convicted in thiscase but allovred to go on his own recognizance of 50 to come up for judgment ifcalled
