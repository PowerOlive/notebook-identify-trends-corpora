ROMANTIC MARRIAGE OF NEWS
PAPER WOMAN.
The "thirty," which Miss Elea
nor Wood wrote to her journalistic
career at Ashland was the shortest
story she had ever turned in, yet
her own romance was the subject.
"Married," said a note penned at
her desk when she stopped on the
way to a train for Maysville. Mere
details, which another reporter had
to dig were that this fair daugh
ter of a Maysville banker, who
came to Ashland a month ago sure
that newspaper work was her voca
tion, had been married to James S.
Moose, Jr., Little Rock, her sweet
heart at the University of Missouri,
who had come to visit her and
wouldn't subscribe to any of her
theories about a "career." He is
in the cotton-oil business in Ar
kansas. The suprise which the
marriage, afforded extended even
to the parents of the principals.

The number of civil service em
ployes on the Government rolls
(exclusive of Army,. Navy, Marine
Corps, and legislative employees)
is now 559,663, the smallest num
ber since the United States entered
the war. At the time of the armis
ice, November 11, 1918. the number
was 917,760. The number of sepa
rations in the last four years has
been 358,097.
The civil service employees in
Washington number 68,718. Sepa
rations in Washingtion, the chief
center for Federal employees, are
proceeding at the rate of 400 per
month.
At the beginning of the war there
were 40,000 employees in Washing
ton. Because of war activities the
number jumped to 117,760. The
reduction has been slow, and the
figure never will be so low as it
was in 1916, because of the new ac
tivities of the Government as a re
sult of the war. The chief addi
tions have been in the Treasury De
partment and in the Veterans' Bu
reau. There will be further re
ductions in the forces of the War
Departmenil the Navy Department,
the United States Shipping Board,
the Railroad Administration, and
the Alien Property Custodian's
Ofilce. It is thought that 60,000
clerks will be the level finally to be
reached in Washington and 475.000
for the natdon.
