MILLERSBURG ITEMS.
Paris Team Hits its Stride at Last.
After suffering'defeat after defeat,
the Paris team seems to have again
come back to its stride and the pros
pects are now that the aggregation
will pull out of the hole and within the
next few weeks are expected to be at
the top battling for first honors.
With the addition of several new
men the locals are putting uo a genu
ine article of ball and the fact was
demonstrated at White Park yesterday
afternoon, when in an excellent exhibi
tion they took the Hustlers into camo
by a score of 4 to 1. Biankenship was
on the mound for Paris and while he
exhibited a little wildness he pitched a
masterly game, ..holding tthe opposing
team to three hits. Tvvo of the total
number came in one inning, which
counted the only run, and after that
he was invincible.
With the addition of Erhard, who
was sent here by "Red" Shears,, and
Preston, from Huntington, the team
has been strengthened tD a considerable
extent. Today there will be another
player in uniform, a catcher, who was
secured inBaltimore.
The game yesterday was transferred
from Winchester, and the game
scheduled here today will be played off
in that city this afternoon." Wednes
day and Thursday the ivermen will
be the attraction at White Park and
the local management has designated
Wednesday as ladies' day, when all the
ladies will be admitted free.
With the Paris team nlayine good
ball the club is deserving of rhe
patronage of the loveis of the sport in
this city. Of late the game ha"s been
played at a loss, and the pride oi the
local fans is appealed to that the club
may keep its head above the water.
Baseball, as a matter of fact,' has put
Paris on the map, and it should not be
permitted to die out for lack of attend
ance. Our club is in the league to
stay as long as it is sustained by the
receipts, if the club must live inter
est should not cease. With the opening
of the series with Maysville let there
be one of the old-fashioned crowds in
attendance. A winning team will be
provided if the patronage will warrant
it, and those who favor a winning
team should not let the matter of a
few games lost stand in the way of at
tendance. Let's get together and
boost and win another pennant.
