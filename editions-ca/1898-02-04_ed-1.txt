stepped out ontothe sidewalk when a joung fellowbright enough as to looks but stillwearing- his summer clothes almost raninto usWhy hello Billy old man exclaimed Park The other replied in aflow tone and Park drew him to oneside In a moment I heard my friendsay Oh thats all right old manany time any time Good night lookin at the studio some day He tookmy arm and we crossed the street to awaiting- cab Poor devil of an art student he explained living- on hopeand faith in himself Nothing fatteningabout it Didnt ask for it but I lenthim five We stepped into the hansomand he added Have any troubles ofyour own wfoen you first began toscribbleI remember one morning- of fastening up my shoes with bits of broomwire not having- the necessary capitalto put into a pair of strings I repliedThe painter laughed We have alleaten our share of mad cow as they sayin Paris he returned Did I ever tellyou of my little experience with certainneighbors before I left CincinnatiNever Go aheadI cant make much of it but 1 cangive the facts If you can fix it up intoanything youre welcome to do sostory telling is your business Maybemy tale is ashadegrewsome and sometimes as I look back at it I think perhaps my action wasnt strictly honestthough I fancy it will pass muster inthis world of sin You see it was thiswajBob Allau hes in Florence nowread about his new picture the otherday didnt you Bob Allan and I wereborn in the same little Ohio villageWe both decided to be celebrated artists so we went down to Cincinnati tobegin Dont ever boast to me aboutyour early poerty we were poverty itself personified and stalking about likea pestilence You may have wired upyour shoes but we didnt have anyshoes to wire At least we had only asirglepair between us and when onewent out the other had to stay in Besides they were too small for me andtoo big- for DobWell we found a place at the top ofan old building- which we thoughtAvould do for our studio It was a bigroom and we got it practically free because the owner couldnt rent it to anybody else It had once been a printingoffice and the floor was deep in inkgrease and general dirt and the wallswerent much better The printers hadmoved away because the building- hadgot to be unsafe for their presses Webought a second hand bed begged achair borrowed an oil stove and stolea soap box and there we were Sometimes we had two meals Sometimes onlyone hut we kept at workYou had got alomg far enough withyour art studies so you had workthen4 I -observedMy dear boy signs oilcloth signsat that And we werent successful atthem either because the regular signpainters could do better work It wasunsatisfactory business for another reason too The sign painters had a uniona d resented our interference and theyused to throw bricks at us as we wentdown side streets However the brickswerent so bad as the turnips and hepuffed his cigar thoughtfully ThoughJ ought to say la justice to those tuinips that they had all passed theirprime before they were thrownWe got on through the fall prettywell but when cold weather came ourquarters became rather cheerless Thewindows were loose the shuttersbanged the skyilight let in the snowand the wind puffed up through thecracks and ratholes in the floor Theratholes by the way were a greatsource of annoyance to us I shallnever forget how proud I -was uhe daj Ibought a toothbrush The very nextmorning Bob lost it down a ratholeWhat made it harder for us was thefact that there were a lot of fellowsabout our own age in the immediateneighborhood who seemed to be enjoying all the luxuries of life Right acrossthe hall from our door was another apparently leading into some sort of clubrooms In the glimpses we caught ofthe interior we saw heavy rugs on thefloor upholstered furniture a wellstocked sideboard and all that sort ofthing The members of the club didntseem to be around very much in thedaytime but used generally to drop inat about eight oclock in the eveningand from then till midnight or aftersounds of good cheer not to say of conviviality would greet our hungry earsWe commonly went to bed early to getwarm and left the wind which came upthe ratholes to fight it out with thesnow which came down the skylightMatters kept going worse with usWe had great hopes of selling one ofBobs landscapes but while he was carrying it to the probable purchaser hegot tumbled over by a runaway andthe picture was ruined It was the dayof the funeral of Paddy Laughlin afamous Cincinnati policeman and thehorses had become frightened by thewaving plumes on the hearse Paddyhad never liked us He had sympathized with the painters union and hadnever failed to make us move on whenwe had appeared on his beat Bob saidwhen he got home that he believed Paddys ghost hoodooed usIt was about two weeks after thisthat Bob and I were coming in togetherhaving got another pair of shoessomehow pretty well discouraged Itwas near five oclock in the afternoonand the prospect for supper was aboutas poor as it could be I had the keyin my hand as we walked down thehall When we reached the door on asudden mad impulse I inserted it in thedoor opposite To my surprise it turnedand the door swung open There wasno one in sight when we stepped in Wefound ourselves in a good sized squareroom furnished with a dozen easychairs three or four couches a sideboard and a piano There were rugs onthe floors and pictures on the walls Acoal fire burned in the grate in cheerful contrast to the blackness of ourown In a small room on one side wasa refrigerator containing chops steaksand other food and in boxes was a tonof coal Beyond was a door leadinginto still another room We were surprised to find this empty with the exception of a table and a long queer boxstanding on carpenters horses Thefloor and walls were bare and the onlyother article of furniture was a washstand I walked over raised the centerof the queer box and looked in ThenI put it down rather hastily I thinkBob started to follow my exampleOld man I said I dont think youwant to look in thereWhats the reason I dont inquired BobOh nothing much but you dontJust take my word for itI wouldnt take your word for anything answered Bob and with that helifted the cover and looked in He putit down without any great delay Thenhe turned to me and saidPaddy LaughlinI nodded Medical students IaddedYes returned Bob edging towardthe door There was a mystery aboutthe disease which caused his death youremember They are trying to clear itupYes An idea had struck me andI was doing some hard thinking Wepassed out into the other roomCome on said Bob pulling openthe door fnto the hallNo hurry I replied carelesslyJust unlock our door and leave it openWhat are you going to doNothing much Just take hold andhelp move these things over into ourplaceWhat do you meanWe need the stuff more than theydoWhat you driving at Well be arrestedHardly There isnt time to answer your questions now Come thechairs first and I hurried one of themacross the hall Bob saw that therewas noting else to do so he took holdwith a will and in ten minutes we hadthe chairs and couches transferredaw- m jIBThen we rolled up the rugs andsnatched down the pictures The sideboard and refrigerator were larger orders but we made them ours at lastwith their entire contents and thepiano followed We even took the tableand wash stand in the unfurnishedroom Then we tackled the ton of coalThis was pretty hard work but with ascuttle and a big market basket -wefinally got the last lumps of it transferred Then we closed and locked theclub door and went to work arrangingthe things in our own room first astonishing our cold and forbidding gratewith a fire Things fitted nicely and inhalf an hour thej seemed quite athome in their new quarters We wereby this time famished so we broiled asteak opened a bottle of claret andproceeded to nourish ourselves Thenwe each ignited a good cigar and layback in two of the biggest chairs before the fire while I explained to Bobmy plan of future operationsThe clock on the mantel also partof the plunder had just struck eightand our cigars were about half finishedwhen we heard a quick active stepcoming along the hall There was apause at the door and the sound ofthe key in the lock one or two doubtful isteps on the bare floor within and thepop of a parlor match A long silencefollowedHe takes it hard I observed toBobRather odd that he should returned Bob helping himself to anotherglass of wineWe could soon hear him wanderingabout from room to room and scratching matches as he lit successive gasjets apparently with the rather vainhope that more light might reveal themissing furniture We started freshcigars and Bob helped himself to another glass of claretIn about five minutes we heard otherfootsteps coming down the hall Thereproved to be two of the newcomersand as stepped into the room theystopped suddenly and there was totalsilence for about 30 seconds We puffednoislessly at our cigars and Bob blewsome smoke rings Then we heard conversation across the hall not loud butdeep Other members arrived in rapidsuccession till we estimated that some20 or 25 must be on hand It seemed asif they would wear out the floors stumping about and by this time the talk hadgrown into a loud and angry babel ofvoices Still a certain pair of youngmen who had resolved to be great artistssmoked on and settled back at a morecomfortable angleSuddenly the uproar ceased andthere was a long whisperedCtffMf frnlxtjSOME YOU MISERABLE THIEVES YOUVE GOT EVERYTHINGtion Then there came a loud rap atour doorCome in I respondedThe door opened and a big footballplayer of a fellow strode in followedby the whole crowd For a momentthey stood aghast We folded ourhands and smoked on Then the leaderin a voice like a bull saidSee here you infernal tramps wthatdo you mean by coming into our placeand looting itLets get at em Throw- em outthe window Smash em came fromhis followers in angry chorusDo I understand you to say thatwe have got some of your things Iinquired sweetlySome You miserable thievesyouve got everythingEverythingEvery last blooming thingAre you sureSure Now you try once more tobe

dontcare for tfhis stuff do we fellows Justkeep it Sorry we have disturbed youGood night and they all filed out likelambs Bob uncorked another bottleand we drank to the memory of PaddvLaughlinThe next day the medical studentslevied an assessment and refurnishedtheir rooms Come on here we are atthe theaterYou say it has occurred to you sincethat it was a bit like stealing I observedVaguely yes

nofurther even among the nations in thesouth of Europe But in the beginningof the middle ages a change began totake place in the method of mixing theingredients and some other substanceswere brought into use Butter eggsand salt found their way into pastrjmaking and the result was a manifestimprovement Paste next came to beused as an inclosure for meat seasonedwith spices etc Afterward it went astep further the next use being for theinclosure of creams fruit preservesetc and later still it began to take themany fanciful shapes in which it hassince been commonly found In theearly stages of

bodily afflictions exist orhave existed even there Tlhere is an individual somewhat over 50 years of agewho has long made this place his homeand for even a longer period has carriedabout with him excrutiating painsHe maintains that he got this troubleat the battle of Shiloh or some othernoted engagement he is not always ofthe same opinion on this head Anywayhe is an old soldier and feels confidentthat the war had a good deal to do withhis affliction His neighbors assuredhim frequently that they were positivesomething might be done for him if hewould put a little more faith and reliance in science and the medical wonders of the century we live in He refused their proffered advice howeverand said tfhat he had tried everjthinga sane man could be expected to trythat it was no use attempting to foolthe rheumatism and that a man of hisage could no more get rid of it than hecould change his politicsOne day however one of his neighbors brought glowing accounts of aremedy that was to be had in ChicagoIt was not necessary to see any doctoror make any extensive outlay All thatwas required was to invest one dollarin a bottle of a dark colored liquidThis did the business The word failwas as absent from the experience ofthe doctor who compounded uhe remedy as it is from the bright lexicon ofyouth At length he yielded to the solicitation although he was not a particle confident In fact he was so loathto believe in the remedy that many people said the most sovereign specificcould not benefit him when in that stateof mind To the surprise of all Ihimselfincluded the remedy did take righthold of him and by the time he had consumed the fourth bottle he was completely cured Whether this was theremedy or the days getting very warmjust at that time or the possibility thathis rlheumatism never had been rheumatism but some other trouble neverwas fully ascertained At any rate theagent of the medicine heard of the occurrence and came down to see the patient He was surprised beyond measure at his improvement although hehad never seen him while he was sickand finally set about to get a testimonial with the understanding thatthe sufferer wag to receive six morebottles of the medicine besides 12 incashThe erstwhile sick man agreed towrite the testimonial The agent didnot want to press things too much sohe saw that the man received his rewardand went back

Massachusetts to the increased insecurity of property and evenof life and serious thought is beinggiven to the means of preventing thisincrease of lawlessness The difficultyarises in large degree from the feebleness of the small towns They havelost much of their population and insome instances a large part of theirproperty With the decline of the native population lhas come in a foreignelement which neglects tke training ofits young people and which is not inspired b3 that regard for law and orderwhich are the essential of peace evenif it is regarded as xery old fashionedAs long as the towns continue to decline and nothing is done to counteractthe present tendency so long will thismenace increase- It is even said that insome towns it is not safe for a womanto be out unattended after dark XhisIseems almost incredible in law aoiainMassachusetts as we fondly regarour state But there is no denying thefactsNow it is manifestly impossible forthe towns to maintain a regular policeforce Tlhey have their constableselected by the town meetings under local influence more or less relying foroffice upon the favor of their neighborsall of them well acquainted with thepeople of the locality and usually of aharmless and nonaggressive type Thehoodlum element does not stand in aweof such an arm of the law Such a police force is weak and contemptible inthe opinion of those who have the nerveto commit the offenses wlhieh are complained of Under the law a constablehas no authority outside of his owntown It is impossible under presentarrangements for two or more townsto combine for the maintenance of ajoint police forcePerhaps the law might be changedjust as it was changed to permit employes on railroad trains to exercise police powers in different towns in orderto give them authority aver disorderlypersons on their cars Or such an arrangement might be legalized as thatwhereby different towns unite in thesupport of a superintendent of schoolsBut sudh combination or introductionof help from outside of the towms is essential for the preservation of propertyand life There is the suggestion thatthe district police force might be enlarged so as to have oversight of severaltowns the districts being small enoughto make such supervision effectualThis would involve an invasion of theold ideas of local self government butit would afford protection where it ismuch neededIt is evident that our old tiheory of local democracies existing in the townsmust be modified to meetthe exigenciesof the times TCie state is the superiorbody Therefore thestate cannot permitthe territory of any town to be used forhoodlums and criminals who sally forthfrom their retreat for the sake of preying upon the property of the people ofother towns or for the disturbance oftheir neighbors This evil has grownto such an extent that it demands recognition by the law makers and conditions ought to be established whichsLall check the tendency of recent yearsin rural

rateDamaris Vane Itad described her character pretty accurately but she concealed from everyone including herselfthat she was growing fonder of CyrilJLTunt than any of tthe other men whohad fluttered round lier sinoe she cameoutIt was the general impression in thesection of society in which site dweltthat Miss Vane was not only a thorough-pacedflirt but utterly heartlessas well The most affecting and touching-love scenes only moved her tolaughter and she would take off hervarious admirers in sentimental attitudes to her most intimate friends afterwards That she had a penchant forCyril fihe allowed but she was muchtoo proud to own that she loved him Itwas quite true that she had a horror ofjealous men but the ridiculous test thatshe had set him was but a pretext togain time and she acknowledged asmuch to herself as she trailed her peachcolored draperies into the sisttly ligh tied drawing room Damaris glancedlazily round and then dropped into aseatfbeside a tall fair manI am going to bore you with mycompanj she said with a glance fromher soft eyesIf I didnt know you better I shouldsay you were fishing for complimentshe rejoined with the eager look thatcame into most mens faces when iMissVane spoke to them She glided off intosome small talk occasiemally castinga glance at Hunt to see what he was doing He looked a little disconsolatelyround him for a second or two andthen drifted into a chair beside MollieBentinck a pretty faced little girl of18 whose masses of light hair and innocent brown eyes were voted as charming by some people though the majority of women complained that shehad no styleMiss Vane smiled sweetly Cyril isactually taking me at mv word shesaid to herself How amusing I amglad he has selected such a safe personthoughWhat are you smiling at said CaptHoward beside herSome men are so simple mindedand they amuse meTs that intended to be personalXo I dont think you worst enemywould accuse you of Wing simplemindedI hope not he retui ued ferventlyAt bedtime Howard remarked withan amused look as he bade Miss Vanegood nightHunt seems quite gooe in that quarter doesnt heYes How touching it is she replied with a smileI am so glad he going to amusehimself she said when she got into herroom mittinsr dowii her candlestickwith a bang on the tableTso doubt it was her delight at Huntsfinding some amusement to while awaythe days that made Damaris lean herchin on her hand and stare fixedly aLnothing till a very iate hourMatters were much the same the nextday when there was a large riding party to some distant ruin Hunt rodewith Mollie Benlinck who showed awild desire to clig to her horses maneand whose hair promptly came downowing to her incessant bumpiug Itmust have been kindness and nothingelse on Miss Vanes part that made herstop as she was cantering past managing her lively mount to perfection toBecause if so you had better gohome she said I am pure Mr Huntwill be pleased to take you backDelighted I am sure said that gentleman In fact to put it selfishly 1should prefer going home its awfullyhot for ridingThus pressed the couple rode oil together It was rather aggravating whenthev all came in hot and tired aftertheir ride to find Cyril and Mollie stroll-ngO-sheabout the garden lookingly cool and freshIt was with a curious feeling thatDamaris found herself waiting underthe trees at the end of the week havirsr dismissed Howard in search of ashawl she never hadHo is sure to come she kept on repeating to herself I must give himlong enough he is sure to comeWhich showed how very little chancereally
