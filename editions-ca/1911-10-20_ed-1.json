The most impressive as well as the
most heautiful wedding witnessed here
in a long time was that of Miss Julia
Carpenter, of this place, to Mr. Leslie
Shrout, of Owingsville, Wednesday
afternon at 4 o'clock at the First
Christian church. The event has been
looked forward to with much interest
on account of the prominence of both
parties.
Long before the appointed time the
spacious auditorium of the Christian
church, which has just emerged from
under the touch of the artist, began
filling with members of representative
families throughout Central Kentucky.
The audience was largely made up of
handsomely dressed ladies. The pro
gram practically opened, when the
ushers escorted to their places on the
rostrum, Mrs. C. M. Best, Misses
Ethel K. Nell and Alma Duke Jones.
The church was darkened and softly
illuminated.
The decorations were made up of
pitted plants and ferns. A beautiful
arch supported by two massive
columns formed the background in the
center of which was a myriad of
candles. The musical program, which
was perhaps the best ever rendered in
Millersburg, opened with a violin solo

by Miss Nell, accompanied us
Alma Duke Jones on the organ. ZZZ,
This was followed by a vocal solo,
"Happy Days," with violin obligata,
by Mrs. C. M. Best, Miss Nell ac
companied by Miss Jones. At the ap
pointed time the bridal party entered
to the soft strains of the bridal march
by Lohengrin, played by Miss Jones,
entering from the right door, coming
down the right aisle were the ushers,
Messrs. Chas. Miller and Mack Grimes.
Mrs. U. M. Swinford, dame of honor,
followed by the bride. Miss Carpenter,
coming from the left door were Ushers
Walter Shrout and Ewell Shrout, Mr.
U. M. Swinford, best man, tollowed
by the groom. The whole formed a
beautiful group about the atldr where
they were met by Elder G. H. rNutter,
of Louisville.
After all had taken their positions
the impressive solo, "O Piomiae Me,"
was rendered by Mrs. Best, accom
panied by Miss Nell, which was indeed
beautiful. The beautiful selnction fill
ed the. vast audience wih deep
emotion. Just as the strains died
away Elder Nutter, in soft, low modu
lated tones began the beautiful Episco
pal ring ceremony, while Miss TJones
rendered most touchingly "Hearts and
Flowers."
At the close of this beautiful cere
meny Mrs. Best sang the answer, "I
Promise Thee. " The violin obligatas
to the last two aongs were the compo
sitions of Miss Nell and have been
much complimented by all lovers of
music. Miss Nell is a violinist far
above the average and her work is
always good. At the close of the last
song Mendelssohn wedding march was
rendered by Miss Jones and the wed
ding party filed from the church, going
to the home of Mr. and Mrs. W. F.
Carpenter, uncle of tjie bride, where a
short informal reception was held.
The bride was gowned in white
broadcloth, large white hat with wil-
I low plume, with large shower bouquet.
Mrs. Sinford, Dame of honor, and sis-
ster of the bride, was beautifully attir-
ed in white serge and lace. The oc
casion was one that will always be re-
t membered by those present. After a
short reception at the home of Mr.
'Carpenter Mr. and Mrs. Shrout left in
an auto for Lexington, from thence to
Eastern points where they will spend
! several weeks. jgg

It provides for emergency. It prepares you for opportu
