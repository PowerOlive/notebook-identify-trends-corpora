UNCLE SAM 10 CENTS AHEAD
3Five Envoi o ies Out of a Buncli That H
Arouldnt Redeem
A reporter went iutu iLe New York
jpostoffice the other day with a bundle
if misdirected stamped envelopes in his
pocket to see if Uncle Sam would not
redoem them for cash He fonud a
window in a room on the second floor
where this is the special business at
tended to Uncle Sams representative
Jooked over the lot of envelopes handed
Tjack five with the cash for the others
tand said
You will have to take a trip to Falls
Neb Columbus Ga Newark
aST J and Brooklyn to get those four
redeemed and here is one we wont re--deem
at all You see it is this way In
-does not matter where an envelope is
addressed to the point is where ig
comes from what postoffice issued it
-A postoffice can only redeem envelopes
-which it has issued itself If au en- I
velope shows on the face of it that some
other office issued it I cant give you t
fcash for it j
xivjw uun mi tiuxa uuc unit m iliu i
-corner is a note After ten days return
to Mr Blank Falls City Neb Evi
dently the Falls City postomce issued
that and you will have to go there to
get it redeemed if you are fond of long
-distance economy of that sort These
-envelopes here with no Return to notw
rmay have been issued by some other
office but we have no means of know
ing it and take them on faith Here is
one marked Return to P O box 285G
INew York city We will take that for
we evidently issued iit The principle
as simple even if its workings look
tcomplicated
The reporter reminded the clerk that
he had refused one envelope altogether
The clerk took it up and looked at it
It had no Return to note in the cor
Jier hut the name and address were
printed on it
Well you see that comes under a
-different rule he continued Tho
idea is to redeem envelopes which have
Ibeen misdirected by accident This man
-has spoiled this envelope to help on his
-business sending it to some correspond
ent inclosed with a letter asking for a
business order likely He expected the
other man to use this envelope only in
-writing to him and to keep him in mind
f it he printed his address on it He
-did not intend to furnish free stamps
for his business acquaintances unless he
got them back on letters to himself
-His correspondent you in this case
either did not send him an order or sent
it in a new envelope Now you want to
iget back 2 cents The business man
spent that 2 cents simply to boom hijj
business Uncle Sam is not booming
any ones business even to the extent
-of 2 cents except where all share alike
through general prosperity You canuot
get that envelope redeemed anywhere
The reporter thanked the clerk After
calculating the cost of a trip to Nebras
ka Georgia Newark and Brooklyn and
comparing it with the value of the four
-stamped envelopes which might be re
deemed by it he concluded it was
on the whole to drop the envelopes in
-the waste paper basket New York Sun
Africans and Work
All hard labor all rough and un
skilled labor is and owing to the heat
-of the climate must be done by blacks
and in a new country like Matabeleland
the blacks though they can sometimes
be induced to till the laud are most
averse to working underground They
are only beginning to use money and
they do not want the things which
anoney buys The wants of a native liv
ing with his tribe and cultivating meal
ies or Kaffir corn are confined to a baross
skin cloak or some pieces of cotton
Te prospect of leaving his tribe to go
and work in a mine in order that he
may earn wages wherewith he can buy
things that he has no use for does not
-tit once appeal to him
The white men anxious to get to
work on the gold reefs are annoyed at
Avhat they call the stupidity and lazi
iiess of the native and usually clamor
or legislation to compel the natives to
5come and work adding of course that
regular labor would be the best thing

Africa by James Bryce
Thomas Hood
Hoods position in literature has been
effected by the circumstance that he
did two things excellently which in
the general Yiew are incompatible in
which case popular opinion generally
xes on the inferior gift as representing
-the writers real capacity He was a
funny man as well as a lyric poet of
vreal quality and earnest aims and was
- -so admirable and original in the former
-and more abundant character that it
probably caused many to regard the
serious verse as merely an ambitious
hid for a reputation it was not in the
writers power to achieve Hood doubt-
iless helped to strengthen this
by practically ceasing to produce
serious poetry for some 15 years of his
short life But that this was due to a
necessity for finding a ready market for
I- his wares is I think beyond a doubt

A terror hedged the heros name
And she was white as ermine
Thenceforth a matron fair and fat
She shared the doting heros station
Thais with Alexander sat
And hoard the plaudits of a nation
What though small souls with furtive leer
Revived old rumors of dishonor
The hero held her yet more dear
And stainless as Madonna
Weary of fortunes smile and frown
Sho died without the White House portal
But never wife wore richer crown
A heros troth and love immortal
That love had mado a queen of her
Whom haughty dames turned prudish
