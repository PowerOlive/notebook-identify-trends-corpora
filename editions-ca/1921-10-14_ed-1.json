City and county authorities, as
well as garage men, are indeavoring
to locate the owner of a Ford tour
ing car bearing an Alabama license
tag No. 49671. Eearly passers-by
coming to Paris on the Maysville
pike from Millersburg found the car
almost demolished thrown across the
top of a rock fence four miles be
low Paris. The car had evidently
turned turtle at a point where there
was a steep embankment, and had
landed on top of the fence.
The regulation license tags had
been removed, and in their places
were crudely painted tags bearing
the number 49671, and Alabama.
No trace could be found of the oc
cupants and nothing to indicate
they had been injured. The police
have a theory the car was a stolen
one, the license tags having been
removed and the fake tags substi
tuted. Alabama authorities were commu
nicated with, as well as the State
automobile department at Frankfort,
in an effort to ascertain if such a
car belonging in Alabama, but noth
ing definite has been learned yet.
