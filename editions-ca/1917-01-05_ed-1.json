FEDERATED CLU1 LUHCHEON
A BRILLIANT EVENT.
(Contributed)
At last the lon&talkedof, much-desired
Federation of Clubs in the city
of Paris is au fait accompli.
On Saturday, December 30, Mrs. Ja3.
McClure threw open her hospitable
doors and a beautiful luncheon was
j served to ninety women who respond
ed to the invitation given the eleven
clubs of Paris and their guests from
our sister cities, North Middletown,
New York and Millersburg.
The tables were placed in the de
lightful sun parlor, livine: room, din
ing room, hall and library. The whole
house was bright with Christinas
j greens and gorgeous crimson poinsei
tas, and old Santa Claus had forgotten
one tree and it still stood at one end
of the long sun parlor to remind us we
were still in the season of "peace on
earth and good will toward men."
The speakers of the occasion were
seated at a large round table in the
library, and huge windows opening on
the porch and doors leading into hall
and dining room gave ample opportu
nity to all to hear the toasts that fol
lowed the luncheon.
Mrs. Fanniebelle Sutherland, the
President of the Federation, made a
perfect toastmaster. Her introduc
tions were short, to tjhe uoint and full
of wit.
Mrs. Frederick A. Wallis, from New
York, responded first and brought
greetings to the Club women of Pari?
from the Kentucky women of Nev
York. She told of their work and
hopes and desires in a most interest
ing fashion and then gave a short
sketch, of the Oriental-Ajnerican Soci
ety, of which she is also a member.
This Club is composed of the wives
and daughters of Chinese and Japan
ese men who are in any way connected
with our government and identified
with the mercantile life of the city.
The American membership is limited
to 100, but the Oriental members is
unlimited.
Next on tile program came Miss
Maymie D. Long, from 'Millsrsburg.
Miss Long brought a message fram the
20th Century Club, composed ot "19
bright women and herself," so she told
us. She said it was a long cry from
New York to Millersburg, and she
didn't have the interesting things to
tell us we had just listened to, bu
but if we would come to see them we
would find a welcome just as cordial,
hearts just as warm, and minds jus-,
as ready to grasp, as could be found
in the whole United States.
Mrs. Allie Smith Dickson, from
North Middletown, claimed to be only
two years old, and said she felt just
as proud to be with us as sheJiad felc
years ago when she was allowed to
go to her big sister's party. The
North Middletown Club was organized
in 1914 and last year had taken Mod
era Drama in their study. Mrs. Dick
son's toast was bright and witty and
was frequently interrupted by ap
plause and laughter.
Mrs. Wm. G. Talbott told the Feder
ation wjhat it meant to be a Club Pres
ident, and Mrs. Talbott was surely
uell qualified to speak. She used one
of Uncle Remas' stories as a text, and
told of the attempt of the tortoise to
fly. As long as the buzzard held him,
all went well, but when the buzzard
let go
The buzzara stood looking at what
was lett ot tne tortoise, and then said,
"You can fly all right, fly as good as
anybody; but what you want to do io
to 'learn to light.' "
And Mrs. Talbott offered the same
advice to any young aspirant, "to learn
now to light."
Mrs. Sutherland said no matter how
feminine a meeting might be, it simply
seemed impossible to entirely elimin
ate the masculine. He just "must come
in so she asked Mrs. John Davis to
respond to the Club Husband.
Mrs. Davis was very briet, but her
suggestions were tmasterlv. The ideal
club husband was in the future, and
the hope of tihe next veneration of
women lay in the training of the sons
oi to-day. Tnus may "wisdom be jus
tified of her children."
Mrs. Oakford Hinton said her topic
was scarcely fair. "Is the Club Woman
An Asset to a CoVnmunity?" There wa3
nothing to say. The "ayes" ihad it
unanimously. She offered many fine
suggestions to the women present!
along the lines of better streets, better
siddewalks, better laws (and better
enforced), as well as better homes and
better wives and better mothers and
better babies.
Mrs. Geo. Stuart's subject was "Side
lights on Club Work," and in her
capable hands .Droved a veritable
"search light." Like the thorough-go
ing woman tnat she is, she began at

the beginning and told how Eve con
ducted her club work. She brought
us down through the Stone Age, the
Dark Age, the Middle Age, on to the
light of the present day, in a quick,
clever, sparkling little speech, whose
briefness gave time -only to touch the
"high places."
Two impromptu toasts brought this
ieasc or reason and flow of soul to an
end.
Miss Lou K. Williams cave a fnnst
to our gracious hostess. Mrs. Mcninm.
and drank her health in clear water
"that is no purer than her own bright
spirit"
Mrs. McClure in her response offer
ed the slogan that she claims as her
own, to the Federation, that they, too,
mignt aaopt it, ".no Illiteracy in Ken
tucky in 1920." This toast was drunk
by all standing.
This closed a most eniovahle nnd
delightful program, the success of
whicjh we owe to Mrs. Thomas Hnr?
Clay, Jr. It is her mind and heart
and quick cajpacity for reading human
nature that makes her past-mistress of
the art of forming a successful pro
gram; and in spite of the modesty that
nem ner m tne background, she had
to listen to and acceDt the grateful
thanks and appreciation of all who
knew it
The mission of the Federation is
to -promote Club spirit, to stand to
geth on all questions of betterment
both civic and domestic, to help form
public opinion, and to pass on to the
women of tomorrow the goodly herit
age that was handed the wolnen of to
day by the women, of yesterday.
