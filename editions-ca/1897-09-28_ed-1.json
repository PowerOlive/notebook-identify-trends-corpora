Inherited blood diseases are much
more difficult to cure than those which
ate acquired One of the most common
hereditary diseases is Scrotma wnicn
the medical proiession admit i ui
obstinate and deepseated and their ef
forts to cure it meet with little success
A child afflicted with Scrofula is always
puny and sickly and can never grow
into healthy manhood until the disease
is eliminated Scrofula leads into con
sumption nine times out of ten so that
it is important for this reason that im
mediate attention be given to all chil
dren who inherit the slightest taint
Mrs S S Mabry 360 Elm bt macon
6a writes
My boyj Charlie inherited a scrofu
lous blood taint and from infancy was
covered with terrible sores his sufferings
being such that it was impossible to
dress him for three years
CHARLIE MABRY
His head and body were a mass
of sores and his nose was swollen to
several times its natural size to add to
his misery he had catarrh which made
him almost deaf and his eyesight also
hontne affected No treatment was
spared that we thought would relieve
kim but he grew worse until his condi
tion was indeed pitiable A dozen blood
remedies were given him by the whole
sale but they did not the slightest gopd
I had almost despaired of his ever being
cured when by the advice of a friend we
gave him SSS Swifts Specific and
at first the inflammation seemed to in
crease but as this is the way the remedy
gets rid of the poison by forcing it out
of the system we were encouraged and
continued the medicine A decided im
provement was the result and after he
had taken a dozen bottles no one who
knew of his former dreadful condition
would have recognized him All the
eores on his body have healed his skin
is perfectly clear and smooth and he
has been restored to perfect health
Mr A T Morgan one of the promi
nent druggists of Macon and a member
of the board of aldermen of that city
says I am familiar with the terrible
condition of little Charlie Mabry and
the cure which SSS effected in his
case was remarkable and proves it to
be a wonderful blood remedy
SSS is the only cure for deepseated
blood diseases such as Scrofula Rheu
matism Cancer Eczema Catarrh etc
It is the only blood remedy guaranteed
Purely Vegetable
and contains no potash no mercury or
other mineral which means so much to
all who know the disastrous effects oi
these drugs
