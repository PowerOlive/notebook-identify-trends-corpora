Holliday as a candidate for the nomination for the office of Police Judgeof the city ot Paris, subject to the action of the Democratic primary, August 2, 1913.The Pinhooker.TheCynthiana Democrat of a recentissue contained the following editorial :"Tobacco growers commonlv believethat the speculator.or 'Pinhocker,, canget a better price for tobacco on theloose leaf market than the growersthemsleves can obtain. This is ofcourse ridiculcus. The buyers do notknow in the vast majority of caseswho own the tobacco upon which theybid. They do not see the tags exceptin occasional instances, for they have.no interest in knowing the ownershipof the basket. To them ownershipmakes no difference whatever. Theywant the tobacco, and go after it ifthe tobacco is of thequality theirhouse demands."The Pinhooker will buy. however,only the best crops as a rtrie, and henaturally seeks to get them at the lowest figure possible. If he understandshis business he knows how to sort thebaskets to the best advantage, and inthat he has the best of the averagegrowers. Crops on adjoining farmswill differ widely, but usually eachfarmer thinks his crop is as good ashis neighbor's and ought to bring asmuch money. The Pinhooker kriowadifferently, and will always buy thebest of any two if he can. Then thegrower across the road who puts hisown crop on the market will believethere is collusion between the buyerand the Pinhooker when the latter getsthe most money."But the grower has one great consolation: The Pinhooker will surely gobroke if he stays at the business longenough!''Increase of Dope Fiends.Drug taking is greatly on the Increase in London.

Lived With Bullet in Brain..Of wounds in the brain here is another example which may be considered wonderful. During the Indian mutiny, a loyal native was struck by abullet upon the forehead, just abovethe left frontal sinus. The bulletwedged its way into the bone. Theskin eventually healed over the wound,and the man resumed his duties as before. Twelve months later, however,he suddenly fell down in convulsions,and died within a couple of minutesof his seizure. The post-mortem examination revealed a truly remarkablestate of things. The unfortunate manhad lived all this time with quite twothirds of the bullet embedded in hisbrain.Naming the Cat.One evening last summer my neighbor's bright little son, aged four, tookdinner with us. After we had finished, Clyde became a little Tiilarious,-and in order to quiet him I said, "Goand call the kitty in out of the yard."He immediately went to the door, andat the top of his voice began. calling,"Come, kitty!

Shestood conversing across the low railing that divided her hack porch fromthe next one in the Garibaldi flats."Wouldn't I, just! Him talking sosmooth and pleasant and nodding hishead: Yes, Mrs. Regan.' 'Certainly,Mrs. Regan!' as though his mouth vasfull of butter!"I was just going through the baspment of the laundry, when I saw himtalking to the jankor and the janitora calling him Mr. PhelpSj as polite, aacould be. It flashed over me h,ere wasmy chance."I went right up to him when Iheard the name. 'Are you the Mr.Phelps that owns the building?' saysI. 'Are you the landlord?' 'Yes,madam,' says he, kind of startled like.'Mr. Kelly, the agent being sick, Ithought I'd come around myself andhave a look at things.'" 'Well,' says I, 'I'm glad to have afew words with you. Not wanting tosay anything against any one whenhe's not here, I won't tell you how thatman Kelly has deceived and browbeaten me and, said 'yes' and acted 'no'to a few simple little requests I hadto make. If that man Kelly was to beasked his own name point blank he'dsay it was Jones just because he hatesto tell the trulh!" 'Look at my gas stove!' I says.'No.' I says impatient, for Mr. Phelpslooked around the basement kind ofwild, as though he expected to see thestove there among the laundry tubs,'it ain't here, but I'll be glad to show itto you! Here am I, working myselfto skin and bone trying to keep thenickel on that stove bright and itlooks like old junk.' And he up andsays he won't furnish a new one because this was new last year. Andme asking him polite and gentle fornew shelves in the pantry every timeI've laid eyes on him, and him sayinghe'd "see about it and he hasn't!These shelves are two inches too widefor any shelf paper and.I'm a neat woman and .1 don't like dust over nextthe wall, .even if it doesn't show!" 'Now, I put it to you, Mr. Phelps,'I says, 'is that any way to treat atenant as pays prompt each month?'"'No, no, indeed!' Mr. Phelps answered, breathless like. 'If you'll excuse me" 'Just a minute,' I says, taking himby the arm. 'While you're here I wantyou to come upstairs and look at thewall paper in my parlor. I've hadMr. Kelly look at it every time I'veseen him and he's agreed that I shouldhave-it done over and then he doesn'tdo it! Of course, I picked it out whenI came in and that was all right, buthow did I know my daughter Mamiewas going to get a craze to have herhair dyed that reddish tint? You canseen for youself, Mr. Phelps, how redhair won't go at all with this pinkishpaper. Mamie has an artistic temp'rament and she says every time she hasto come into this room it makes herfeel faint and she is neglecting herpiano practice something shockingjust because she can't stand her hairnext to this paper."'Henry Dilbeck, the plumberaround the corner,' I says, 'is payingparticular attention to Mamie and,goodness knows, she may lose him,feeling so awful about the paper andnot being able to concentrate her attention on him as she ought, men being so keen on being made a fussover! Any man with a heart, Mr.Phelps,' I says, 'would feel sorry forMamie and not let the price of a fewrolls of paper spoil her life, poor girl!Though I don't -see why she pickedout that shade of red for her hair,even if it is stylish. When will yousend the paperhangers, Mr. Phelps?'"He said at once that he'd see andstarted to go, but I stopped him. isaid that besides the gas stove andthe paper and the pantry shelves Iwanted the floors done over and newwindow shades and new gas-fixturesin the dining room like they have atMrs. Casey's in the next street, andthat there ought to be a new carpetdown the front stairs. All he did wasnod and say 'yes' and agree with meand I told him that he was a gentleman with sense and Kelly might welltake a lesson from him."When I was opening a closet doorto show him where I needed newhooks he opened the front door andslid out"i waited and waited a week forthe paperhangers and the new stoveand things and nothing happened,,and then I looked in the telephonebook and called up Mr. Phelps office.No dealing with tnat Kelly for mewhen I can get the owner!"What do you suppose I got? Somesnip of a girl says: 'Mr. Phelps leftword to tell -Mrs. Regan that he'd goneto the middle of Africa for ten yearsand was likely to be delayed gettin'back and for Mrs. Regan to please seeMr. KelJy!'"Kelly! You can't trust any of 'em,says I. But wouldn't I like to tell Mr.Phelps what I think of him? He'sworse'n Kelly!"

Sunday Magazine.THE BOHEMIAN GIRL.Nothing succeeds like success, andthis is once more demonstrated in thecase of the Aborn Opera Company'srevival of that most popular of operas,"The Bohemian Girl", in English,which is now in it second successfulyear, and which comes to the ParisGrand on Thursday, Feb. 6.The secret of the phenomenal success of Balfe's masterpiece is not hardto find, when one recalls such beautiful ballads as "The Heart BowedDown," V'Bliss Forever Past," "IDreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls," and"Then You'll Remember Me", and various others numbering in the totalmore than any other standard operacontains. Combined with these is abook that evolves as prettv a romanceas forms a part of any opera now being presented. It is said the Messrs.Aborn have gien to "The BohemianGirl" scenic equipment comprising sixmagnificent scenes, among which isCount Arnheim's palace in the mountains of Austro-Hungary, a picturesquegypsy camp, a street fair, and theMarble Halls.Previous to the Aborns' revival ofthis opera no American managers hadnever undertaken the task of treating itspectacularly, to which it lends itselfso perfectly. For instance, in the firstact. they employ a score of horses inthrillingly melodramatic style, and inthe second, in the gypsy camp, areseen a band of real gypsies with theirhorses, dogs, chickens, geese andswine, while in the street fair scenetheJHassen Ben Ali troupe of whirlwind acrobats are among the unusualfeatures shown. While these innovations were never attemplpd in theUnited States previous to their adoption by the Messrs. Aborn, on theground that they were inconsistent,they have all I found to not only fit.but greatly enhance the interest of jthe opera. In the interpretation ofthe opera is employed an. unusuallylarge company,-which includes .besidesan exceptionally strong double cast offgrand opera soloists as principal animmense choras, corps de ballet, qnda number of special performers. Themost important in the cast is HelenaMorrill, as "Arlne," Nella Brown asthe "Gypsy Queen," Roy Pilcbre as"Thaddeus," Wilmot CI Goodwin as"Count Arnheim," Detmar H. Popkinas "Devilsboof," Stephen Stott as"Florestein." The special orchestrais under the direction of George Lyd-ing.5fcV.
