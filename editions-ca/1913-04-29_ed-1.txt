Without questioningDr. Kenney's statement the Mayorasked, that these two amounts bepassed for invesir&atoin before approval. The 3laynr did not say that heknew the wages had not been earned,both the Mayor and myselfstated thatwe knew that the men had workedfor Dr.JBrown and had been told byme superintendent or tne streets tnatthe time hadnot been included in theirclaim against the city.Ihe time for the city hands is andhas been for three years kept by boththe Supaiintendent of Streets and theSuperintendent of the quarry, and ischecked up by the City Clerk, Mr. J.W. Hayden, and approved by theMayor before the signing of thevouchers. This does not appear to besuch careless management.For eighteen days, which coveredall thetime during a part of whichone of the men worked for Dr.Brown the city paid for only eightdavs, and for one week during whichone man worked two days for Dr.Brown the city paid only for threedays. The records of the City Clerkand the Treasurer both show theamounts paid. The remainder oftheir time was paid for by Dr. Brown,and they did not work for Dr. Brownduring any of the time for which thecity paid. Any one mav easily certifythese facts and they ought to convinceany one that the motive of the articlereferred to must have been other fchanthe good of the city.Respectully,W. O.

James O'Leary, knownfor twenty-five years as the "King ofGamblers," famed as the man whowould "bet on anything," stood recently at the end of his bar on Halstedstreet watching a little army of carpenters transforming the building.An old friend of O'Leary's, a cattledealer from Walden, Colo., came boisterously in, announcing:"Jim, I'll bet you five hundred itsnows tomorrow.""You're on," said O'Leary automatically then started suddenly, remembering. "I mean I won't cover you,"he corrected."Why what's the matter withyou?" demanded the amazed visitor.And O'Leary spoke gravely, with alittle catch in his voice"I ain't a betting man," he said."Look at these carpenters."The huge fake chimney at the rearof O'Leary's place, the dhimney fromwhich smoke never was seen to issue,the chimney which contained a ladderleading from the steel-doored clearingroom of the old gambling house to thebasement that chimney is to be adumb waiter to connect the kitchenwith the dining roonj, of a chop sueyestablishment.King Joy Lo has taljen a fifteen-yearlease from the old gambler and is preparing a chop suey place."It's all off," explained Q'Learylater. "I've met my last bet unlessI drop in at Ionte Carlo or somewhere and buck another man's gamefor the fun of it."O'Leary has been rarcled hundredsof times. He has been tried and convicted and tried and acquitted, alternately. He has played faro and rou-"Jim" O'Leary.lette with multimillionaires, who losttheir money or some of it and declared that the game was "square."In the old days, when faro androulette were "wide open" in Chicago,O'Leary's was the place sought by the"real sports." There was a limit onthe play ordinarily, but O'Leary wasalways ready to remove it on request.Qnce he bet a friend that the lattercould not go from Halsted street toDublin, Ireland, in a week. The bestwas $1,000. The man made the timeand sent O'Leary a two-word cablegram "You lose." O'Leary cabledthe money.There have been rare occasionswhen O'Leary was accused of trickygambling. He disproved the charges.Most of the big gamblers knewO'Leary's reputation for squareness.And the result was that when theywanted to make unusually big wagersthey came to Chicago from all partsof the country to do it. eFIND RECORD OF FORTUNEBottle Discovered Beside .SkeletonContains Inventory of Wealth Belonging to Empress Eugenie.Perpignan, France.

Every morning a numberof the leading surgeons of Denvergather at the county hospital to watchthe remarkable spectacle of a man sixty-threeyears old literally being borninto the world. Each day the patientacquires the use of one or two moreof his faculties, until he can nowmove, eat, recognize persons andspeak a few words.The man is Luther DIonne, who forfive years has been practically dyingfrom a tumor in his brain. He wasparalyzed, speechless, sightless andoutwardly dead on December 30 lastwhen two surgeons operated upon hisbrain.They removed a tumor larger thana walnut from the cortex of thebrain The tumor had destroyed all.the nerve fibers except those runningto the heart and lungs.For two weeks after the operationLuther DIonne lay as if dead. He wasfed through the nostrils. Then hebegan to undergo a complete second birth into life. His fingers beganto move. The next day his toes moved.On the third day he could lift hisarm slightly, and so on, day after day,the rejuvenation continued. At theend of ten days he regained his sight,but was like a baby, and knew no one.When two weeks had passed he spokea word or so, repeating after thenurse "food" or doctor or nurse.A few days ago the aged man wasso far recovered that he could sit upin bed. feed himself, distinguish onenurse from another and speak quite afew of the simpler words that he hadheard used by the people in his ward.One of the surgeons says that DIonne is well on the road to completerecovery, and that he is regaining hisnormal faculties as fast as new nervefibers grow through his brain. Memory has not yet returned, but in timeho will be able to take up his lifewhere it left off when he loBt consciousness five years ago.

The Standard Oil company's tank ship Schuylkill, which arrived from Yokohama recently, notonly narrowly escaped foundering in atyphoon in the China Bea, in whichone of the Chinese crew was lost overboard, but also was threatened witha mutiny because the remainder of themen persisted in thinking they werepusued by the dreaded "banshee" ofthat religion. A weird whistle, thatseemed to pursue the ship, added totheir fears. Joss sticks were burnedand prayer papers thrown overboardin vain.Finally, in the hope of propitiatingthe spirit, i they seized upon a crowdog belonging to the first mate andthrew it over the side. The whistlingceased, but when First Mate Fitzgibbons heard the fate of his dog therewas more trouble. He found theChinamen praying before an idol inthe forecastle. Throwing the idolthrough a porthole, he pummeled thesuperstition out of his crew and therewas no further talk of Chinese banshees. The strange whistling was made bythe famous w histling fish of the Chinasea, according to Fltzgibbons, and thefeast on dog propitiated them.GIRL RECOVERS AFTER SHOCKRecovers Powers of Speech and Hearing When Brother Kills SelfYoung Man's Prayer Answered.London.

There is an anomalouscondition of affairs in the native village here. The serious minded youth jof the village is scandalizer Dy the frivolity of the aged.For that matter, however, the samecondition exists in all the TWinget villages from the head of the Lynn canalto the Portland canal, with one exception. The young Thiingets, educatedin the government schools, in themines and other industries, are sobered by the ideas of modern civilization and fired by ambitions which relate to modern industry.With the exception of Chief Yalthkock of the Chilcats the elders do nottake to ths ways of the whites. Theystill live largely by fishing and stilllove the ancient dances and potlaches.They dance through the nights, gorgewith hootch and candy, and potlachlarge sums in gifts. The songs theelders sing, however, are no longermusic to the now cultivated ears ofthe young men.For this reason petitions have beensent to Governor Clark and applications have been made to the UnitedStates marshal for the suppression ofthese social functions. At presentthere is some difference of opinionamong the authorities as to the extentof the police powers and the right ofthe marshal to interfere.Of all the old natives, Chief Yalthkock is the only one who has encouraged the members of his band to takeup the ways and habits of civilization,for they owned more than sixty slaves.For all that he himself adopted thehabits of civilization at a very earlydate, recognized the freedom of theslaves, and has been a strong friendof the government teachers and missionaries. In order to keep the young men athome he spent $15,000 for band instruments and paid for an instructor forthem.

Mark Podner, twentythree years old, was arrested at Lakeview, near here, on a charge of burglary and larceny. He owed his capture to a unique man trap, a maze,which the owner of the house hadconstructed.The Lakevlew belongs to J. J.

Bizant made a maze withlooking glasses in the house, and whenPodner broke into the place, whichwas tenanted only by the watchman,Henry Meyers, he could not got outPodner, who believes in ghosts, hadheard Bizant's place was haunted, hesaid, and wanted to find out for himself. When he got into the maze andin the dim light saw his own figure inthe mirrors he became terror-stricken.The wind was moaning and Podner'simagination conjured up evil spirits.To escape from the house he ran everyway, but in vain. Twelve times, hesays, he went up and down the stairway, hoping to get his bearings, buteach time at its foot he met a mirrorand would flee in terror, only to beconfronted by another.Podner always had longed to seespooks, but 'he says the excitement ofhis one night in the Bizant castle wastoo much for him.

Forty-one of his sixtyone years having heen spent behindprison bars. Abe Buzzard, the notorious outlaw evengelist, was releasedfrom the Eastern penitentiary recently. Speaking of his Jekyl and Hydecareer, Buzzard says:"The world owed me a good livingand I collected the debt the best thatI kzjew how. I was not used right thetime I was first arrested, and had Inot been blamed for crimes 1 nevercommitted, I would never have resorted to the life that I have led."I am converted now and realizethat it does not pay to think that youare going to get away with the kindof stuff that I used to pull. I'm goingto shake the dust cf Pennsylvaniafrom my feet and go to the Pacificcoast. I've learned to bo a cobbler and I'm going into the shoe business out west, where no one will knowme, and where I will have a chanceto start life over again."Buzzard began stealing at the ageof fifteen, when he and three brothersorganized a gang to raid farms in theWeQch mountains. When twenty hebegan serving a ten-year term in Lancaster county. He broke out of jailand was recaptured several monthslater.After serving several other sentences he was relsased from CherryHill in 1901. Then it was he professed reformation and began preaching.He did his evangelistic work duringthe day and stole poultry at night. Inthe course of a few months he stole1,800 chickens and 7,500 turkeys fromthe farmers in and about Reading andLancaster.WORRIED OVER HIS ABSENCEDennis Redmond, Aged 99, ThinksHe's Old Enough To, Even If HlaDaughter Does Worry.New York. When Dennis Redmond, who is a spry young man ofninety-nine, strolled into the house at897 Morris avenue, the Bronx, wherehe lives with his daughter, Mrs. William H. Nash, the latter asked mildly where he had been since Fridaymorning. Redmond replied that hethought he was old enough to stayaway from home overnight once inawhile. Didn't Mrs. Nash think so?Mrs. Nash admitted he was, but added that she and her husband, who is abattalion chief in the fire department, had been worried over hisabsence. So that reckless youth explained. He went out for a walk, he said,and then decided he would go downto a store on Astor place where heused to work and see some of hisfriends. Then, being near the oldFourth ward, he took a notion to visitsome of his former cronies, some ofwhom are mere Infants of eighty orso. This he did, and the time passedv pleasantly and rapidly that whenone of his friends suggested that hespend the night he accepted and didnot send word home.He had no idea any one wouldworry about a -young man past twentyone. But Mr. and Mrs. Nash didworry so -much so that they told thepolice of the Morrisania stationwhosent out a confidential alarm. Mr.Redmond seemed to think that was ahighly foolish proceeding.BLACK FACE IS ARRESTEDWife Tries to Discover How HusbandSpends Money Policeman SeesThrough Disguise.Chicago.

She decided to black herface, after telling her landlord herstory and receiving his promise to assist her, in an effort to learn whatMiller was doing with his money.So one evening the pair blacked up,but not very successfully. They hidthemselves in a hallway at State andVan Buren streets, but passersby easily detected the difference betweenthe blackened imitations and the realarticles, and Policeman Ernie Johnson was called. He took the pair tothe South Clark street station, wherethey were booked on charges of disorderly conduct.CAROLINE AGAIN SLIDESInhabitants of Fleurier Watch Descent After Moving Belongings toOther Near-by Hills.Neuchatel, Switzerland.

" 'EXCESS OF CAUTION SHOWNEfforts to Keep Police CommissionerWaldo of New York In the DarkFoiled by Pains Taken.New York. This may,, be setdown as one of those unfortunate things that so often setpeople laughing at reformers. Thecity of New York Is indebted toMessrs. M. C. and S. for the accuraterecording of every word that is uttered at the Curran committee hearings in the alderman's room of cityhall. M. C. and S. are stenagraphiccode names of the three smart youngmen who sit at the table in front ofthe witness chair and jot down everybit of police scandal In immortal Pitman. They do it in relays.When M. has recorded five minutesworth of scandal, he jumps up, hurriesto an anteroom and proceds to declaim 'his notes Into the receiver of aphonograph. Five minutes later C.follows him, goes to his own phonograph and declaims. Five minuteslater S. does the same, M. by. this timehaving told his story and returned tothe table in front of the witness chair.The cyclinder records are turned overto one of three young women who sitwith tubes at their ears and transcribeupon typwriters what the cyclindersare teling them.One day Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo came to testify. He gotthere too early, and the Curran grafthunters didn't want him to hear whatthe witness, ahead of him was saying.ntv V'"2,,' SLjS&ACommissioner Waldo.So they ushered him Into the veryanteroom where the phonographicstenographic sharps were at work.There the commissioner waited andgrinned as the voice of Mr. M. declaimed something like tnte:"Q Was Policeman Murphy In theprecinct at that year? A No commaPoliceman Murphy was in the Bronx.Q Do you know when he was transferred? A Yes comma I think It wasin 1907. Q " and so on.When Mr. M. Got through he packedoff to the hearing and Mr. C. took upthe refrain. Everything that has beensaid in the hearing was being repeated there five minutes later in thepresence of Commissioner Waldo. Hegot every word of it not omitting asingle comma.HOBOES FEAST FROM GRAVERoast .Ducks, Pigs, Wines and Delicacies on Chinese Mound Provide Splendid Banquet.Philadelphia. Before the funeralcortege of Yung Chong, a wealthyChinaman of this city, had passed outof the cemetery gates where Chonghad been buried, there was a wildscramble of hobos of all descriptions.They made a rush for the grave ofthe Chinaman, where a great feastawaited them. On the casket and onthe grave were left roast ducks andpigs, Chinese wines and nuts and other delicacies "to help Chong acrossthe Styx."When the crowd of twenty-five hungry hoboes finished there was littleleft for Chong. From many carriageson the way. to the cemetery flutteredscraps of colored paper bearing prayers. The Chinese believe the devils whopursue 'the spirit of the dead have tostop and read all the prayers, and themourners of Chong believe tha theyhave scattered enough to keep thedevils engaged until he was safelyburied.For ten years Chong has either beenpresident or treasurer of the On LeongTong, and his word was law in thatsociety. He was one of the richestChinamen in this city.HEIRESS CHAFFEUR'S BRIDEElopement of MIs3 Middleton . LastDecember Just Revealed inWashington.Washington.

The idea Was conceived somemonths ago by Mr. M. P. Collier wholias in a quiet, though successfulway, prosecuted it from that time until now. Mr. Collier largely throughhis own efforts had secured stock tothe amount of $7,300, in shares of $100each. On Saturday afternoon he calleda mass meeting of citizens for the purpose of discussing the adisabiliry ofsuch a warehouse and to devise waysand mean of procuring stock. Therneetincr was far more successful thanair. Collier or any one else had anticipated, notwithstanding the fact that itrained almost the entire day of Saturday a large crowd of representativecitizens were at the City Hall at threeo'clock, Mi. Collier actingjas chairmanof the meeting, stated the purposeand at once much enthusiasm was'manifested. Short addresses were''made by Messrs. W. D. Mclntyre, W.SJudy, J.C. Leer, E. C. Hawkins. Col.W. ZM. Layson and others. Messrs.!McIutyre and Judy who have had large-experience on the" loose leaf marketwere asked a number of questions, andxojall they replied that a loose leaimarket would be a good thing for MilM5rjfjf alersburg ; that the farmers graw thebest tobacco, the largest amount tothe acre, and that buyers would besent to procure it. There being a surplus of warehouses throughout thissection, naturally some were sketpic.This however, was dispelled when Mr.Leer, said that if they would build a$12.000ahouse and loose leaf proved afailure that he would rent the samefrom them at 6 per cent, on their investment. The enterprise took a newlife, and considerable stock was subscribed at once After an earnest address by Mr. Collier, calling attentionto what this would do for Millersburgand surrounding country and the employment it would give to labor, themoney that would be saved at homewhich now goes elsewhere, a motionwas made by Mr. Mclntvre to appointMessrs. M. P. Collier, S. M. Allen andJ. C. Leer a committee to solicit stockduring the week.There is no longer any question asto the building of the warehouse. Itcan be erected for about $1,200, andmore than that amount will probahlybe raised in the next few days. Therewill be a meeing of stockholders in thenear future.Mr. Henley Houston visited relavties at Carlisle Saturday and Sunday.Mr. Clarence McCarty arrived fromLexington yesterday with his automobile.

Notwithstandin the inclement weather, she wasgreeted with a great audience. Theprogram was peculiarly good inasmuchas it was the departure fromthe average. Miss Asbury gave a completestory of the three carts entitled, "TheLittlest Rebel," instead of miscellaneous selections. Her work was well executed, and the musical prorgam wasexceedingly appropriate. The firstpart was made up of a medley ofSouthern airs, on violin and piano byMisses Jones and Kimberley. "The second was a duet, songs from the South-'land by Misses Maris aDd Norn's, andthe third was a quartet of three violinsand piano. All of these selections assisted Miss Asbury in carrying out thetrue thought of her story as the scpne-was laid in the Southland.Better ShoeValuesAre Hard to Find.Of course it's easy enough to find Shoes at low prices, but notso easy to find the same kind and quality at such prices as we are - :"offering you now.
