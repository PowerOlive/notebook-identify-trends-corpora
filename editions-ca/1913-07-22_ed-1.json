August 6, 1913.
lady clerks in the store of Frank &
Co. became panic stricken when the
roof was blown from. he building
and hurled with great force into
Fourth street, impeding traffic and
and damaging adjoining property.
The property is owned by Mrs. Mollie
Roche, who suffered a considerable
loss. Accordfng to a rough estimate,
the damage to the stock of goods of
Frank & Co., ogether with than sus
tained to the building will amount to
$15,000.
Another heavy loser is Mayor J.
T. Hinton, whose immense furniture
store at the corner of Main and Sixth
street was unroofed and his entire
stock of furniture almost ruined by
water. All of thegoods on the first
floor tht could be easly handled was
taken to the building of Mr. Ed. Tuck
er, across the street where it was stor
ed until the damage can be repaired
The heaviest loss was sustained in
the carpet department, where thous
ands of dollars worth of carpets were
damaged by the water.
The building occupied by Clarke &
Co., and owned by Mr. Hinton, was
stripped from its roof from the front
to the rear of the building. The force
of the heavy wind carried the rafters
of the structure, which were piled pu
in great heaps in the rear yard.
Mr. Robet Frank, a member of
the firm of Frank & Co., had a narrow
escape from death or serious injury,
when he was struck on the head by a
piece of flying timber. Mr. Frank,
thinking the storni would -be severe,
attempted to reach his home on High
street, when the storm was at its
height. In, front of Dr. D. B. Ander
son's office a piece of falling timber
struck him on the head. He was
partly stunned by the blow,-but was
able to proceed in the blinding rain
to his home.
Another miraculous escape is report
ed. C. T. Fightmaster, who resides on
Fourth street, was seated at a window
at his home, when he received a tel
ephone call. He went to answer the
call, and when few feet from the
window, a chimney came crushing
through.
The stable" occupied by Mr. J. TJ.
Boardman on Bank Row, -was unroofed
by the wind, and blown into the rear
yard of the Kentuckian-Citizen office
causing considerable damage to ad
joining property. Bricks were hurled
through the roofs of the two smaller
buildings adjoining.

opposite the Elks' building was badly,
damaged by the wind. The root was
torn off and the front of the building
from the windows of the second story
blown in.
The loss of a number of horses was
narrowly averted when a section of
the stable of Thomas. Morris, on Pleas
ant street collapsed. Several horses
were hitched in this portion of the
building whiph was constructed of
wood and brick. This section collaps
ed and the animals were pinioned be
neat the debris. Five of the horses
were rescued without much difficulty,
while a fine gelding belonging to John
Brophy was so badly injured that it
had to be destroyed.
Pleasant street from Sixth to
Twelfth was covered with branches of
trees that had blown across the thor
oughfare, while Walker's avenue, on
the highest point in the city, was
blocked by a score of telephone poles
that were snapped off at the ground
and blown across the street. The roof
of many residences in this part of the
city were badly damaged and many
chimneys blown off.
Great excitement prevailed for a
tinie in the grocery store of T. C.
Lenihan at the corner of Main and
Eighth streets. The store furnished a
refuge for a number of pedstrians
among whom were several ladies.
When the tin roof from the building
of Stuart & O'Brien, directly opposite
was blown off it was hurled with great
force across the street in front of the
grocery store. Two women fainted
from fright, while others thinking the
building in which they had taken ref
uge was being blown to pieces at
tempted to force their way through the
doorway into the street, and it was
with great difficulty that those who re
tained their composure to restrain
them.
The building occupied by C. S. Gold
stein was damaged to a considerable
extent when the roof was blown off
and his stock of goods was almost
completely ruined by water. A large
glass in the store of Mr. Harry Simon
was broken. Miss Jessie Brown suf
fered considerable damage to her
her stock of embroidery goods.
The residence of Dr. Frank Fithian
on Houston avenue was struck by
lightning and caught fire, but the im
mense volume of water which accom
anied the storm extinguished the blaze.
Hundreds of beautiful shade trees
trees throughout the city were blown
down, or stripped Of- their foliaage.
Three of the" heaviest losers in the
storm were the Cumberland Telephone
Co., the Bourbon Home Telephone Co.
and the Paris Gas & Electric" Co.
More than one-hahlf of the elephones
in the city have been put out of com
mission as a result of the lines being
blown down. A large force of men
are now employed in reairing the dam
age. The city was without street
lights Saturday night from the fact
that it was considered unsafe to turn
on the current with so many of the
electric wires down or crossed with
broken telephone wires. Extra work
men were employed all of Sunday in
getting the lines in shape to turn on
the curent.
While the loss in the city will go
far into the thousands, it is nothing as
compared with those sustained by the
farmers of the county. From reports
received, more than fifty tobacco
barns in the county were demolished
by the high wind and crops suffered
