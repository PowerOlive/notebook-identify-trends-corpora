the NicaraguanCanal Independent of UsJapans AggresBlve Policy May Get HerInto Trouble With the United StatesThe Administration WillKesont AnyInterference With the ProjectNew York Sept 3 A special to theHerald from Washing ton says Japannot content with an interference withPresident McKinleys Hawaiian annexation policy now has designs upon theNicaraguan canaL According- to semiofficial advices just received here fromNicaragua the Japanese government issecretly negotiating- with the diet ofthe great republic of Central Americawhich recently met in Salvador forthe construction of the Nicaraguan canal independent and in defiance of theinterests and influence of the UnitedStates or other nationsThis action of Japan taken in connection with her recent attitude in regard to Hawaiian annexation is of thegreatest significance showing as itdoes to the authorities that there is nolimit to the ambition of the nationand that her aggressive policy may yetget her into trouble with the UnitedStates That the administration willresent any interference with the Nicaraguan canal project as it did in thecase of the Hawaiian annexationtreaty goes without sayingIf Japan can encompass it according to the Nicaraguan advices receivedhere she would like to obtain the abrogation of the treaty rights possessedby the United States in relation to inter-oceanictransit and the forfeitureof the American canal concession fromNicaragua and to immediately make atreaty with the diet of the greaterrepublic of Central America givingher control of the canal route throughNicaragua In the negotiations CostaRica has not been consulted it beingwell known that she would not assentto a violation of treaty rightsIt has been suspected in some quarters that England which has alwaysbeen anxious to acquire at least a jointcontrol of the canal might be workingin collusion with Japan in the bickering with the diet now understood tobe in progress but nothing has yetcome to the surface to indicate thatshe has encouraged Japan in the moveIt is said that the agent of the Nicaraguan canal here has laid the facts before Mr Hitchcock the president ofthe canal company in New York withthe suggestion that the state department be apprised of the secret negotiations that are now being carried on between Japan and the diet Senor Zelaya the president of Nicaragua it isunderstood has admitted to close personal friends that Japan is negotiatingwith the diet but in each case he advised the strictest secrecyA private letter just received in thiscity from Nicaragua saysAmong the Americans in CentralAmerica the belief is general that theGreater Republic of Central Americawhich is represented in its diplomaticaffairs by a diet composed of threemembers one each from NicaraguaSalvador and Honduras was organizedprincipally in order that Nicaraguamight absolve herself from individualresponsibility as a nation and therebyabrogate her inter oceanic transittreaty with the United StatesThe so called Greater Republicresenting the failure of the UnitedStates to recognize the Greater Republic on receiving Senor Rodriguez asminister and in failing to accredit aUnited States minister to the GreaterRepublic is likely to try and make atreaty with Japan granting her concessions for the construction of thecanalThe United States minister here believes that when this news reachesWashington the state department willsend a note to Japan asking if she isseeking to interfere with out treatyrights in the premises The Americans in Nicaragua believe that theUnited States government willinsist that her inter oceanic treatieswith Nicaragua Costi Rica Hondurasand Colombia are yet in force although the diet claims that Nicaraguaand Honduras are no longer separateand individual nations and are therefore irresponsibleAlthough state department officialswill not admit that any informationhas yet come through official channelsto confirm private advices on this subject

year A delegate convention ofall miners who have suspended workhas been called to meet in ColumbusSeptember 8 at 10 a m to actupon the recommendation President Ratchford and the othermembers of the board say there isnot the slightest doubt but that theminers will approve the recommendation The proposition does not involvearbitration and in effect provides foran immediate settlement of the strikePresident Ratchford said that therewere special reasons for the boardrecommending the proposition In thefirst place it concedes the miners a material advance Had a 69 cent rate beensecured he was confident it could nothave been maintained for more than 70days The proposition does away withall the uncertainties of arbitratiomandwill bring the strike to a speedy termination As soon as the miners ratifythe proposition work will be resumedin all the mines In the second placethe proposition provides for a revivalof the joint conferences for the adjustment of prices The operators arepledged to meet with the miners priorto the termination of the agreementand determine the rate of mining forthe next year Both the membersof the miners executive board andthe operators committee are pleasedover the outcome of the conferenceand feel that public sentiment willsustain their action Friday morningthe operators committee renewed theirfirst proposition for 64 cents pendingarbitration This was again rejectedby the miners board Then the operators committee got together and submitted a new proposition for a straightprice of 65 cents and after a long discussion it was accepted by the minersboard subject to the approval of theminers at largeThe following circular was issuedFriday night by the national executiveboardTo the Mine Workers Who Have SuspendedWork in

between the national executive board and district presidentsof the United Mine Workers of America and arepresentative committee of the Pittsburghdistrict operators whom we consented to meetonly after it became apparent that a nationalconference of operators and miners could notbe convenedThe following propositions were submittedby the representatives of the Pittsburgh operators to the executive board and district presidents as the basis of a settlement to terminatethe present strikeFirst The resumption of work at a 64-cent-rateof mining The submitting of the question to a board of arbitration to determinewhat the price shall be the maximum to bo69 cents and the minimum to be CO cents a tonthe price to be effective from date of resumingworkSecond A straight price of 65 cents a ton tocontinue in force until the end of the year withthe additional mutual understanding that ajoint meeting of operators and miners shall beheld in December 1897 for the purpose of determining what the rate of mining shall bothereafterYour executive board and district presidentsafter much deliberation and a thorough consideration of the two propositions do recommend the latter as in their judgment the bestthat can be secured because of circumstancesthat are apparent to all who study market conditions since the inauguration of the strikeYou however are the court of final adjudication and must decide for yourselves whatyour actions shall be and when work shall beresumedAdditional reasons will be given and a fullreport made of the general situation at theconvention We would further advise thatdelegates come untrammcled by resolutionsand uninstructcd other than to act in yourbest interestAt this time it is deemed advisable for thereason that provisions are made in the uniformity agreement now pending in the Pittsburgh district and which it is expected will booperative in that district on and after January1 1898 to arbitrate the question of relative differential between pick and machinemining which will we anticipatedo much towards furnishing us withmore reliable data on that questionthan we posses at present and to that extentwill be beneficial to us in settling questionsbetween machine and pick mininghe state board of arbibration ofOhio which has been in communication with the committee of operatorsand miners union officials during theirconferences being asked for an expression about the settlement gavethis statementThe settlement is a most fortunatetermination of the strike There hasbeen no question in any quarter thatminers wages should be increasedThe only question was how muchConsidering the difficulties in the wayon both sides in regard to the adjustment whichever proposition is accepted it is a fair and reasonable oneThe operators went more than halfway and sacrifice not a little but thisis done generously and ungrudginglywith the purpose of securing to theiremployees a living wage and their action is appreciated and met in a spiritof kindness and fair dealing Weregard it as a forgone conclusion thatthe settlement will be formally ratified on Wednesday next and see noreason why work may not be resumedat onceRoyalty at

wonndedPRESIDENT AND CABINETTo Be Consulted Before Attorney General McKenna Announces His OpinionOn Section 33 of the New Tariff Law Relating to Discriminating Duties FewCandidates for the Regular Fall CivilService Examination for OfficesNew York Sept 6 A special to theHerald from Washington saysPresident McKinley and the entiremembership of the cabinet will probably be consulted before Attorney General McKenna announces his opinionas to the construction to be placed onsection 22 of the Dingley law imposingdiscriminating dutiesThe attorney general had expectedto announce his report this week brtnow the understanding is that it is tobe held back until next week and inthe meantime the president will cutshort his outing and return to Washington It is probable that the questionwill be the subject of a general exchange of views at a meeting of thecabinet before the opinion is writtenThe questions involved are so important that all the light possible is tobe thrown on them before the administration is committed to a constructionwhich might demoralize the entire foreign commerce of the country andwhich involves a matter of about 30000000 per year in customs revenue according to the calculations of the officials of the treasury departmentThis calculation is made on the basisof last years imports and on the assumption that the imports under thediscriminating duty would be practically the same in value and wouldcome in ships of the same nationalities British ships bringing goodsfrom other countries than British territories in Europe would be the heaviest sufferers and it is expected thatone result of the imposition of thisduty would be the transfer of manyBritish ships to the flags of nationshaving more favorable treaties wTiththe United StatesThe general assumption is that onaccount of the imposition of theseduties on goods coming into the UnitedStates through a contiguous countrytrans continental roads of the UnitedStates would be benefited at the expense of the Canadian Pacific roadbut when it is taken into considerationthat the steamship connections of mostof these roads would be unfavorablyaffected it appears that about the onlyroad which would gain any decided advantage would be the Southern Pacificwhich having connection with theAmerican line of steamships from SanFrancisco would have the advantageof discrimination in favor of its steamship connection as well as against itsCanadian rivalAbout the only cities that would gainany decided advantage woukl be Halifax and St John as the effect of thediscriminating duty on goods broughtinto the United States over the Canadian Pacific would tend to take upthe transit of such goods through NewEngland to the seaboard and divertthis traffic to those ports in British territoryWashington Sept G The regularfall civil service examinations throughout the country for all classes of government offices wall muster only abouta quarter or a third of the usual number of candidates This is the prediction made by the civil service commission and Chief Examiner Serven attributes this falling off to the unusualnumber of applicants Examined duringthe spring when a high water markwas reached the number of applicantsexamined then being an increase of 100per cent over the precedingfall or spring This rush wasdue to the change of administrationand the civil service extensions madeby President Cleveland As a resultand in view of an inadequate examining force the commission is far in arrears in marking the papers and 14000of them all submitted during thespring examinations have yet to bereached for marking This aggregateincludes 2255 relating to the railwaymail service and 1451 to the clerkcopyist places This unprecedentedarrearage has been a great factor

there was no man to claim theright to share the venture none to meddle with the method of his immolationSo long- as Windy Gulch had beenaccounted one of the deadest campsin all Colorado its peace had been undisturbed but now that an era of prosperity had dawned a walking delegateappeared to organize a branch of theMiners union and Harvey Neil wasfirst of all waited upon by the committee deputed to request that thenceforth the mine owners would employnone but union men while certain details as to wages and hours of workwere peremptorily insisted upon Themajority of the mine owners believingdiscretion the better part of valor conceded the demands after brief parleybut Neil with a spirit ill equipped tobrook undue interference in what heconsidered his private business sentthe deputation to the right about withiuch stinging speech that the unionwas roused to immediate retaliatiouand for the first time in all its historyWindy Gulch was treated to the spectacle of a strike that boded no good toany manIt was a time of general business depression and hundreds of needy workingmen were eager to take the placesvacated by the strikers but the unhappy scabs came but to suffermartyrdom Threats and execrationspursued them through the streets of thecamp and some who were caught outafter dark were so mishandled thatthey were glad to cry enough and escape to the minor evils of wagelessnessand want Neil so far from beingbrought to terms by such methodsgrew but the more obstinately intrenched in his position with contemplation of each new outrage Suqh nonunion men as had stood by him hewould protect by every means in hispower upholding their rights as wellas his own come what would He wouldlisten to no talk of compromise notone iota would he yield althougha nympathetic strike had now been ordered and every mine in the camp thatdepended upon hired labor stood stillfor his determination Deep shaftsfilled with water and costly machineryrusted in idleness and Windy Gulchbut the other day as law abiding andsleepily plodding as any New Englandvillage was now alive with a throng ofboozing idlers nursing bitternessagainst the mine owners and especiallycasting curses upon the name of HarveyNeil whose plutocratic indifference tothe rights of labor was held to be thecause of all the trouble Appeals lorprotection were made to the authoritiesin vain until at length the strikerssouls inflamed to frenzy by non successand want that cowards ally dynamitewas invoked to bring to terms the -cotmine while had not Harvey Neilbeen summarily hustled out of sightby frightened friends the chancesseemed that even murder might havebeen added to the horrors of that nightThe county authorities were nowaroused to take summary action andpeace was after a time restored Butcapital which might have been temptedhad been frightened back from a fieldwhich lawlessness could so dominateWindy Gulch poorer by far than it hadever been before had ceased to dream ofany boom while Neil all the costry improvements upon his property destroyed with no possibility of redressfound himself practically at the foot ofthe ladder once more More disheartened than he had ever been the youngmtin who now felt old borrowed moneyto get his mine in working shape oncemore and when that was done he betook himself to the east for the rest andchange he so sorely needed after thestrain that had been upon himAnd now up by the old trail theGrubstake mine was presently vyingwith the Mascot in outward showing ofprosperity Buildings went up and development work proceeded at such nxate only unlimited wgimanqtcPcapital could bring- to pass while all thecamp wondered The Grubstake hadbeen located years before by a couple ofcredulous youths who were directed intheir operations altogether by the pretended revelations of a so called professor of spiritualism in Denver Although they had carried their tunnelsome sixty feet into the mountainsidebefore they ost faith in their oracle andsold out to the colonel for a song nomineral had been discovered while thecamp was generally of the opinion thatnone ever would be until the newowners operations stirred doubts as tothe soundness of that judgment Somethere were to opine that the colonelmight be preparing new bait for one ofthe English syndicates o the type thatsc often had been his gudgeon otherswho thought themselves equally wellinformed as to the great promoters peculiar methods argued that he wasmore probably plotting mischief whichwould presently be apparent in thegrdund where the two claims crossedprophesying that Neil would beforcedfor his own peace eventually to purchase the Grubstake at its owners ownfigure while others still more full ofcharity oward a gentleman who so faras reputation went seemed generally inthe position of the under dog contendedthta the work upon the property meantonly that there was mineral to be uncovered there since whatever his faultsthere was no man who could see f avtherthrough a stone than Col RandolphMeredith And these last could takeUnction to their souls when one da3r theore wagons began coming down fromthe Grubstake side of the hill on theirway to the Orodelphia smelter whilerumor said that a strike had been madesurpassing even the Mascots richnessHarvey Neil was still east when thisoccurred and the honest gentleman incharge of the mine who could wield asix pound jack as though it had beenbut the plaything of a child but whosevery soul sickened before the laborsof a pen being moreover of simple andunsuspecting turn of mind little givento poking a meddling nose beyond thelegitimate limits of his own domainsaw small reason to descant upon aneighbors good fortune be3ond barestmention of the strike Several monthshad therefore gone before Neil wno hadbeen detained beyond his first plan byan illness of his mother return edto findout what had been goingonover the hillThen it was observed that he lookedtroubled and anxious and the campsomehow became aware that he hadvisited the Orodelphia smelter to obtainsamples of the ore which the Grubstake was shipping in such prodigiousquantities while it was said that heheld many consultations with his lawyer It became known after a littlethat he had asked permission to gothrough the workings of the Grubstakeand had been refused the mine according to Col Merediths invariable practice with all his properties it wasstated being rigidly closed to all visitors Later the camp laughed appreciatively over the story that wentround of how Neil had outwitted hisastute neighbor by sending an emissary disguised as a workman to spyout what the Grubstake levels mightdisclose and after that nobody wpdsurprised when it became known thatsuit had been brought for 50000 damages and an accounting for ore abstracted from the Mascot mine throughthe overreaching workings of the Grubstake while pending the decision ofthe court the alleged intruder was summarily enjoined from further removalof any ore from that portion of theground embraced in the crossing ofthe two claims And the knowing onehad hardly time to demonstrate howclearly all this chimed in with theiroft repeated prophecies when theywere given further opportunity toprove how keen had been their prescience by the filing of a cross bill onthe part of Col Meredith followed bya counter injunction restraining NeiJhiuiself from further meddling withthe territory in dispute until timeshould be given to prove before thecourts that there was but one true veinin evidence and that a direct continuation of the GrubstakeCHAPTER IIDorothy Meredith rode slowly alongthe sandy shore of Gem lake her enjoyment of the scene subtly enhancedby the suggestion of forbidden fruitmore distinctly in evidence with everymoment of dallying Before her mindseye she could plainly see her father Jfuining with impatience as he lookedfor her out of the shaft house door atthe Grubstake mine where it had beenarranged that she was to meet him atthis hour of four in the afternoon butwhile the troublesome vision appealedto her sense of duty on the one handon the other it but filled her with perverse longing to loiterIn all Colorado she was sure no scenecould be found more wildly beautifulthan this tree fringed water like a bitof silver dropped down in the mountains embrace with the changinglight of a rising storm falling uponevery feature with strange transmuting touch As with most happy folknatures somber mood was but a pleasant play upon her senses a chord ofsweet minor to thrill her with newdelight and her mind was simply achaos of incoherent exclamation as herglance ranged from the gray swirlingclouds to the water making kaleidoscopic play with the leaden tints

nosign of habilitlojx nothing that borethe tousli of numan hands besides thesmall segment of grass grown roadcurving abound at one side of the tinylake It seemed a fair dream world ofgTay and silver where nature mournedalone refusing to be comfortedBut though in the vested independence of American girlhood she might beoblivious to the claims of an irate father she could not long remain deaf tosuch warnings as the winds were nowshrieking through the trees She wasnot yet ready to admit that she hadbeen unwise to linger so long but asshe turned her horse back to the roadshe was forced to reflect that withmore than three miles lying betweenher and the shelter of the Grubstakeshaft house she was bound to have ahard ride to escape a wetting A skilledand fearless rider however it was buta new pleasure to give the horse hishead settling herself in the saddle fora break neck race with the storm butjust at the foot of the first hill she suddenly drew rein while her gaze wandered uncertainly up the unkempthalf obliterated track turning off at theleft the Old Silver trailTen years before just at the last ofthe Silver City excitement her fatherhad brought her mother and herself tostay for a month or so at Windy Gulchand then with a childs fondness forgadding she had learned the topography of all the region round She remembered perfectly the line of the old roadwhich now passed directly by the Mascot mine and within a stones throw ofthe Grubstake her glance as it wandered up the newer way which now toohad grown old clearly recalling thepoint of intersection By taking thisshort cut she could save a mile or morewhile with such gain in time she oughtbesides to be able somewhat to mollifyher fathers wrath by presenting herself in dry clothing So far as she knewthe way beyond the Mascot mine wasnow never used and with its originallyflimsy construction and the awfulgrades which had brought it into disfavor the chances were that it would bein the worst possible condition for safetravel but Miss Meredith was not accustomed to question her ability to gowherever horse might carry her whileuhe wiry little broncho she rode wasblessed with a cat like capacity forclimbing at any angle and over any sortof ground which seems the essentialprerogative of the mountain bred ponyBefore she had given as much time tothe argument as it has taken to tell itshe had turned the horse and was flyingalong the old roadThere was a pleasure in recognizingfamiliar features of the landscape asshe swiftly passed them by This nartow intervale hedged in by almost parallel lines of foot hills she rememberedso well although inthe old springtimethe ground had been almost carpetedwith great purple anemones while nowit was masses of yellow bloom whichthe wind was bending down to earth1but the grove of quaking asps intowhich she presently rode looked newand strange obviously they had sprungup since her time And they hadgrown up in such amazing numberthere were myriads of them all in afrou frou flutter their delicate wrappings turned silvery side out as thoughin futile effort to cover their whitelimbs from the storms rude touch Thegirl felt suddenly lost as the way closedin among them and she would havehastened to get out into the open oncemore but their branches so sweptacross the way that she had continually to take care lest she were caughtwith stinging blows from them Plainly nature had been left to work herown will with the old trail There weremarks of wheels wood teams the girlinferred from the deep ruts worn hereand there but when the wa3r twisteddown to the bottom of a deep coulee andup a wilderness of rocks and pine treeson the other side it seemed a marvelthat any wagon could followOn and on she went scarce heedingthe landscape now except to watch forthe longed for juncture of the tworoads The roar of thunder had begunresounding through the mountains asthough voicing the wrath of Jove whilewith the sound a nervous terror insidiously grew upon the girl Utterly fearless in most situations full of athoughtless daring due in a measure toan inability properly to measure danger and yet she always quailed beforea thunder storm and never had

withher nervousMisrelish of the now almostincessant thunder her soul turnedsick though to go on appeared such aquestionable adventure that shestopped short on the brow of a shortsteep hill considering the other side ina misery of uncertainty But even asshe looked fate came to her relief revealing the figure of a man on horseback passing between the trees justover the brow of the next hill He

under our early Anglo Saxonand Danish kings traces of which havesurvived in our existing jurisprudenceBy tlie Anglo Saxon laws every womanwas -under the care of some man whowas termed her mundbora or guardianand no one could marry her withouthaving first paid a sum of money as acompensation to her mundboraThe father of course was the guardian of his unmarried daughters thebr6ther if the father died and next tohim the nearest male relative if however Nthe female were friendless andalone she found in the king her legalguardian There were no runawaymatches no clandestine and romanticnuptials among the Saxon pepplej theycHd everything even to their very loveaffairs in a plain matter-of-fact waythey estimated the value of the maiilaccording to her rank in life and thelaw fixed the sum which should be regarded as a legal tender to satisfy theavarice of her guardians The firststep in courtship therefore was to buythe consent of the mundbora the loverwas then admitted into the society ofhis ladylove and allowed to claim herin due course as his wife If howeverher personal inarms or her dispositionproved on better acquaintance unsatisfactory to her suitor and he failed tocomplete his bargain he became immediately amenable to the lawIf a man ventured to many withoutfirst having bought and paid for hiswife he was guilty of the crime ofmund breach the consequences ofwhich were both disastrous and vexatious The husband in such a casepossessed no legal authority over -hisspouse he was a husband in fact without a wif er he could recover no compensation for any insult which anotherman should dare to offer her she hadnot been paid for the guardian had received no consideration and all thedamages or fines inflicted for such aninsult were payable to the womansIf a man wished to take his wife intoa foreign part or into another thanesland he had to enter into a compactwith her guardian that no wrong shouldbe done to her that she should receiveevery mark of attention and kindnessIf a man bought a maid and paid forher ho other could negotiate for herpurchase but if any fraud had beencommitted on her part or on the partof her friends she was returned homeand the man

dirt Of course there was a newedition of the old yarn of the ferventyouth and the lovely maid As soon asScroggins suspected the attachment hebegan to concentrate his enmity whichhe had hitherto directed impartiallyagainst all men in Atkinsons direction After he found other plans ineffective he began seeking a way to reduce Atkinsons earthly necessities toa pine board coffinAdjoining claims furnished a pretextfor a quarrel One morning Scrogginseased his revolver in its holster shouldered his shovel and went out Insteadof stopping on his own property he deliberately walked some 20 feet over theline and went to work in Atkinsons territory Atkinson looked at him inamazement and Scroggins stoppedshoveling to return the gazeEf yer think Bob Atkinson that ashadder of a skeleton like

look intothe mouth of Atkinsons weaponEdgerton coming down the trail heardBob speak sharply Git Andif you everset foot on my place again youll haveto be carried off Scroggins lookedinto his eyes and

which seems serenely confident that it will win It is only 36 mileslong and runs from Dublin to TennilleIts name is the Wrightsville Tennillerailroad and is especially distinguishedfor its prosperity and its pugnaciousqualities Last year the cotton growers along the line of this road wereJ compelled to ship their cotton over theGeorgia Central because the road refused to issue through bills of ladingover any other line Some of the growers wanted to ship their cotton overthe Augusta Southern but the Wrightsville Tennille refused to give themthrough bills over that line and madeno pretense to disguise their preferences The result was that the GeorgiaCentral got nearly all the cotton andthe Augusta Southern got leftThe matter wTas carried before therailroad commission and that bod3handed down a decision ordering theWrightsville Tennille railroad to issue through bills of lading over allrailroads and not to play any favoritesThe commission also ordered the attorney-generalof the state to beginproceedings for damages against therecalcitrant railroad and to try theissue involved before the state courtsAttornej General Terrell has preparedhis case and will go down to Dublin totry it before Judge Hart The defensewill be represented by former SenatorA F Daly of Wrightsville Not onlyis the right of the state to manage itsrailroads involved in the trial of thecase but the interstate

contracted a habit of withdrawing from his stomach a quantity -ofwater by means of his trunk whichhe then squirts over his back and sidesin order by its evaporation to cool hisskin As this process is repeated on anaverage of once in every five minutesand as the elephants aim is not goodhis efforts to keep cool cause considerable inconvenience to his riders whoare frequently sprinkled by the

DairymanSorghum for the SiloWhile no kind of grain as feed can supercede corn in cheapness and valuesorghum is a formidable rival to it forfodder especially when put up in thesilo It stands drought better which islikely to make it popular in the aridportions of the west where corn oftenfails The sorghum has too tough astalk to feed green but when cut andput in the silo there is enough fermentation to soften the stalks so that theycan be eaten The sweetness of thesorghum furnishes carbonaceous nutriment just as does the starch of corngrain and in even more palatable formWherever

country are gradually going over to the belief that goodroads are for their personal benefit andthere is a decided change of sentimentalong the line in many of the statesOne of the chief obstacles to the reformhas been the fear of the farmers thatthe cost of highway improvementswould fall ohiefly on them and as theyfeel that they are already burdenedheavily enough they resist the passageof good roads laws with their local influence and their votes often to the defeat of these worthy projects NewJersey has a law now in f oroe howeverthat illustrates how properly this burden can be divided between the individual and the community so thatitfallalightly upon the farmer This law apportions the cost of all road improvements as follows One third is pa id bythe state one tenth by the individualbeneficiary of the improvement theowner of the abutting property and theremainder by the county in which theimprovement occurs lieducea to ascale of thirtieths the state pays tenparts the individual three parts andcounty seventeen parts Stated instill another way the various burdensare more easily appreciated The average cost -of repairing a road with amacadam finish is about 3000 a mileOf this sum the -county would pay 1700 the state 1000 and the individual300 It is to be remembered that the300 in ithis case is -usually dividedamong -several persons as few properties in this section of fhe country extend for much more than a quarter orbalf a anile along a highway and thetax is assessed on the owners on eachside of the Toad Thus it will frequently occur that the individual will pay directly for a first class road in front ofhis property and for a mile adjacentsuch a small sum as 40 or 50 To be-sure ne navs as well his share of thecounty tax and in less proportion hispart df the state tax but these burdensare comparatively light and easilyborne These improvements in NewJersey are undertaken on the petitionof the owners of the abutting propertySuch laws as this if copied in otherstates would probably result in an immediate betterment of the countryroads in every section an improvementof untold benefit to millions of peopleWashington StarBuilding of Good Roads Will JUtilceIt Delightful IndeedWherever experiments in rural mail delivery have been made it has been foundto work most successfully during clearweather when the roads were all rightWhich indicates how indissolublylinked together are the problems ofgood roads and the uplift of the sociallife of the farmThe time has come when the American f armer must sit down to think outthis question of good roads and how toget them It is not an exaggeration tosay that to the future of American agriculture few things bear so important arelationship as does the question ofgood roads Indeed if the generationnow growing up on the farm is to bekept on the farm better social advantages will be found absolutely necessary and what single thing could contribute so much as good roads to theelevation of life upon the farmBut the whole question is being discussed in a desultory and indeterminateway -which promises nothing for thefuture Organized effort in which thewheelmen of the town and the farmerof the country should stand shoulder tomust be put forth if substantial advance is to be made With theharvests out of rthe way there should be-set on foot a imovement looking to thisendWith good

advantage to farmers ifit turns their attention to grain asa cheaper source of nutrition thaneven the best hay can be More thanthis if given with enough hay or strawor cornstalks to distend the stoiriachgrain is better food because more easilydigested In the coarser fodder so muchof the nutrition goes to sustain animal beat or the processes of digestionthat comparatively little is left tomake flesh or milk or fats The knowledge that some grain with hay makescheaper nutrition is not half so widelyextended as it ought to be Jf it werethere would be a better demand forgrain and it would sell at better pricesAmerican CultivatorWaldorf Fruit SaladTake half a pound of cherries thesticks and stones having been removedsome fresh strawberries and raspberries with a few slices

fragrance of schnitzel andwurst Then it was Americanfbr achange and cowboys aud red Indiansswaggered across the scene and Eodawater and maplemenu Now itwith a fine oriental flavor but by thetime this is published it will be something else and it really matters verylittle The exhibition attributed to jurynation would be as gay Nqbody caressave perhaps a few tradesmen andmummers who smell the commercialbattle from afar It is an open secretthat the semblance of a show is theremerely to court avoidance The yearsin passing have turned it into a bigbazaar but not even in this guise can itprove the chief attractiontnat counts is tne garden wnere onemay walk under pleasant trees whereone may ape the continental and drinktea or coffee at little tables but mostly tea in capacipus jpots to the accompaniment of thick slabs of cakejhereone may be still more un English Tandeat ones dinner outdoors not llke awild beast in a cage as in the oldbox at Vauxhall but in companyon a low broad veranda where thereare side shows more diverting thanPepys ever dreamed of where one mayloaf away the summer evening listening to music which is at least asgoodas the honest Briton likes it For thetruth is the garden furnishes just thatform of amusement which Mr HenryJames has lamented was not jto befound in London and so long as it isopen one need not as he thought giveup the idea of going to sit somewhere inthe open air to eat an ice and listen toa band of music Only the amusementmust be shared with so big a Sprowdthat one will have to scramblefor achair engage a dinner table full 12hours beforehand and struggletto gethome by underground or bus as furiously as the mob fights to push into thepit of a popular theaterTo provide the Englishman jvith acrowd to give him the chance to usehis
