neighboringIndians of the White Earth reservation claim to have many reasons fortheir present outbreak although thedirect trouble with the Pillagers comesover attempts to bring in some of theIndians to the United States court atDuluth in connection with liquor selling casesTheir grievances go back throughmany years and there have been legislative and other attempts to settlethem one of the latest being the Nelson law regarding the sale of timber onthe Indian lands However the Indiansclaimed that the method of disposing of this was both cumbersome andexpensive and that they were thesufferers In regard to serving asas witnesses in illegal liquor sellingcases they claimed that the deputymarshals left them to find their ownway home from Duluth without having paid them the proper mileageThis is denied by the deputiesThe leader in the trouble withthe Pillagers is an old warriornot a chief whorecently returned from court and wassoon afterwards sought again by thedeputies He alleged ill treatment inbeing turned adrift penniless inDuluth and aroused the otherIndians to protest against the wayhe claimed to have been treatedThe United States marshal insiststhat the old mans story is unfoundedbut the reds had been stirred up tosuch a pitch that trouble apparentlybecame unavoidable in view of thedeeply seated feeling of general illtreatment in regard to their timber- T lltiPdsand

June 14but that he had no knowledge of theplan of campaign before goingaboard the transport He thentold of the voyage On June 21Gen Shafter ordered him to disembarkthe next day which he did with a portion of his command He rode intothe country -four miles that day andthe next moved his troops to Jaguracita He then began his reconnoitermg arranging with Gen Castillo ofthe Cuban army to send Cuban troopswith his men for the reconnoisancebut unfortunately the Cubans did notkeep the engagementHe told of the first battle at LQuasima stopping to complimentespecially the regular troops and alscto speak of their excellent firing Theysoon learned to distrust the reportsand estimates of the Spaniards GenWheeler had not been able on his ownaccount to secure any accurate estimate of the Spanish loss during theAmerican approach upon SantiagoSpeaking of the proceedings afterthe first battles he explained that hehad been reported sick and there weresome movements just prior to the battle of El Cane with which he was notfamiliar I was not sick he saidbut I had been on the 29th and 30thStill I had not gone to the sick list Ihad a fever but I appreciated the situation took

this respect He devoted himself tothis task and I think there is no doubthe succeeded We used pack trainsand there was comparatively littlesuffering because of the shortness ofquartermasters suppliesGen Wheeler said in response to aquestion that Cerveras fleet was theobjective of the campaign There wasno reason why the Spanish troopsshould not have made a sortie fromSantiago and he asked Gen Toralafter the surrender why he had not attacked The latter replied that thefailure to do so was because his menwere foot sore Yet Gen Wheelercould not accept this explanation forthe Spanish soldiers were not footsoreGen Wheelers opinion was that theSpanish commander was not able toface the Americans in the onenTHE PEACE COMMISSIONERSJudjro Day Sends an Important Cablgram to Secretary Hay

slow about coming in it is suggested that some of the patriotic citizens of Paris interest themselves in thematter and see that Paris sends a liberalsubscription It would not be a bad ideato give a concert a carnival or a performance of some kind to assist in raising a liberal subscription It wouldbe an everlasting shame if Kentucky failed to do the handsome thing after being honored by

at what has been calk d thecrossroads of the Pacific the UnitedStates has annexed a new languageand a somewhat considerable literature owned by the 35000 left as theremnant of their race The Hawaiianis not a difficult or crabbed speech Itis soft and musical most of the whitepeople now in Hawaii speak it moreor less fully and it offers no great difficulty to the others who may be expected to fill up the new domainIts most prominent characteristic isthe great use of vowels Besides thefive vowels it needs only seven consonants to make up the alphabet andthe one hard and fast rule of the grammar is that two consonants shall nevercome together and hat no word orsyllable shall end with other than avowel On the other hand vowels maystring along in indefinite successionThe speech abounds with whole wordswhich have not a single consonant tohold them together Two vowelsstand side by side in a majority otwords The opportunity to triplicatethe vowel has not been neglected aword has been formed of every suchcombination Thus aaa meansfriendlyieeeis the verb to rise upHi is little ooo means to shrinkand uuu means to stammerFour vowels together form manywords as aaua a crone or hag

highly developed ingrammar and rhetoric developed bythe savage Hawaiians up to the limitof their needs and containing the elements of a still further developmentThe rnoof of that may be found in

take hero West Point the previous summermd let her as he said to himselfparalyze the corps One of the sweet3reams he had often dreamed was ofthe evening when with Florence on hisirm he should reenter the old messball which he had not visited since it wasbravely decked for the 2Sth of Augusthop the year of his marriage He hadpromised to take her thither for thegraduating ball and had pictured heris the belle of the occasion soughteagerly by the cadets as their partnerfor waltz or two step and as in hisyes she was the most perfect creaturethat ever lived or moved his one anxletj was lest the boys ini gray alwayssusceptible should forget that Floy wasonly a child and fall in love with herforthwith It never occurred to him asa possibility that Floy in her turn mightfall in love But there was no deliciousvisit for Florence to the Point that yearThe moment examinations were overat school her mother started with herfor the far west and Tremaine mettihem at Santa Fe Junction Then afterone brief

thefamous frock that doughty majordonned whenever he sallied forth to askthe intentions of OMalleys dashinglight dragoons and this reflection gavehim pause If either by accident or design the heart of his precious child hadbecome wrapped up in Merriam thenMerriam should not leave the pest without an explanation But there was yettime It might be that the poor fellowwas really sore smitten himself andthat the tender but unconquered heartof his daughter was touched with pityfor his suffering -Meantime the culprit officer himselfhad been carefully lifted into the doctors buggy and with that excellentpractitioner was enjoying a drive Theone thing Wells could not understandwas that while his patient rapidly gainedin health flesh and appetite he seemedsotodroop in spirits Not one word hadhe

with gratifying resultsin shocking corn He says that onedifficulty that is experienced in tyingwith twine is that the shock is aptto be bound too loosely and then itwill not stand well He aims therefore to provide a way for getting agood squeeze on the bundle beforetyingMr Amstutz says Take an oldbroom handle a foot shorter than thelength of twine to be used At oneCORN SHOCKING TOOLend make a hole through which youcan put a strip of leather whereby toattach a piece of rope to the stickThe rope should be about four inchesshorter than the twine A quarterinch rope is the best size At the outer end of the rope fasten a ring justbig enough to slip over the stick easily In use proceed as follows Takethe handle and ring in one hand reacharound the shock pass the ring intothe other hand and then slip the buttend of the handle into the ring Nowshove the ring along the handle downto the leather turn the handle outaway from the side of the shock andit will stay there while you

and with good reason thatthe Southdown is the finest muttonsheep in the worldBut the Merino contributes manynoteworthy qualities The lambs gettheir fatness and tenderness from theMerino and this greatly helps thelambs in the markets Altogether thecross produces about as satisfactoryresults for the general breeder oflambs for mutton as anyThe lambs when two weeks oldshould be taught to eat a

a Calico Dress and 1U0Penalty for Sellingthe GoodsIt is a singular fact but none the lesstrue that in England in the year 1700 womenwere not allowed to wear calico dresses atall and in 1721 a penalty

to sell more than onedress pattern The women of this countrymay bless their lucky stars that nothinghas ever interfered with their privilege tobuy and Avear calico to their hearts content Moreover
