Decoration Day May 30th
The Honor Roll
With the last of our soldiers home from the
Rhine, Memorial Day this year should be observed
with, a special obligation particularly for those
men who gave their lives for the freedom of the
world.
. There is no better way to pay tribute to these
heroes than to dedicate our lives to the principle
foe which they died.
In our efforts to JDe of usefulness to our commu
nity we pause to giee thanks that we are privileged
to enjoy citizenship in a nation 'whose" sons have
made the supreme sacrifice for 'the principle that
"right makes might."
Let's not forget the debt we owe to them.
May 30th is the proper day to think about it.

It was a dramatic finish" for Old
Rosebud and the announcement that
a recent accident had rendered such
a close necessary will- be received
with a peculiar sense of loss by all
lovers of a gallant bit of horse
flesh, by all who like to remember a
splendid race.
In the story of this American
classic there are not many names
which are part of the legend, but
Old Rosebud is assured a place
among them. A Kentucky horse,
and supported religiously by Ken
tuckians that brought him to short
odds on the morning of the Derby,
the gelding flattered his backers by
breaking the record and setting a
mark that has never since been sur
passed There came shortly after
ward a period of eclipse, and then
the great horse emerged to new vic
tories and to justify the fabulous
tales of his old partisans
In the history of the turf Old
Rosebud will stand with Bend Or,
Igonomy, Ladas, Salvator, Regret,
Exterminator, Ben Brush, flro
quois, Gladiateur, Bonnie Scotland
and other marvels. They are not a
great company, but emphatically a
select.
THE TRAINING CAMP IDEA
It is a highly unusual and partic
ularly interesting act on the part of
President Harding when he commu
nicates by telegraph with the Gov
ernors of States urging themjo co
operate in creating interest in the
idea of the Citizens Military Train
ing Camps. Efforts since the Wbrld
War to formulate a settled military
policy for the United States have
been hampered by many influences,
but it now appears that all concern
ed are now- in agreement that the
best to be hoped for in the way of
"preparedness" is a body of several
million young men training in the
fundamentals of military service.
Since this training is to be given at
the camps held each year in the va
rious Corps areas, it becomes obvi
ous that the training camp idea is
the nucleus about 'which the army
of the future is to be built.
Under the new law providing for
the United States jmilitary establish
ment we have the Regular Army,
the National Guard and the Organ
ized Reserves. Our Regular Army
has always been exceptionally effici
ent and the present National Guard,
by reason of lessons learned in the
World War, is a more dependable
factor than ever before. But both
these branches of the army are in
adequate to meet any considerable
emergency, and if the useless expen
diture of blood and treasure of the
past is to be prevented in the future,
we must have other reserves of
trained men.
This reserve of man power must
come from the Citizens' Military
Training Camp, and hence the vital
importance of the course of instruc
tion at Camp Knox, and other
training vCenters, in August. It is
therefore of capital importance that
our young men be urged to attend
these camps where, in effect, -they
will have a month's vacation' "at
government expense. The qualifica
tions as to character, education and
physique make it certain that only
the flower of youth of the-land lis
eligible, and we hope to see Ken
tucky well represented among the
3,000 students at Camp TCnox in
August.
It is required that applications
be in by May 31 and requests for
detailed information should be sent
to Headquarters 64th Cavalry ;Di
vision and Organized Reserves for
Kentucky, Room 515, Postofnce
Building, Louisville, Ky.
THE
STATE MEMORIAL
FALLEN SOLDIERS
TO
Four thousand four hundred and
fifty-nine dollars have been subscrib
ed by 442 students of the University
of Kentucky toward the memorial
fund for the erection of a State Me
morial Building in honor of the men
of Kentucky who lost their lives in
the World War, the committee for
raising funds has announced. A. B.
Cammack, chairman of the High
School committee of Owen county,
reports that good returns will be
made there this week. The churches
of Owen county enrolled in the
fund-raising campaign will report
the progress made next week. The
total amount subscribed to date in
the Louisville district as anngunced
from Headquarters, is $34,000. A
scholarship of $50 to the high
school student in each county who
turns in the largest amount of sub
scriptions has been offered by the
University of Kentucky.
YOU'VE MET THIS BIRD?
"Oh, he's so witty; I just love to
hearvhim talk." Thus spake a wo
man in our office the other day, and
we agreed that the gentleman in
question was a wit of the first wa
ter. But to be always witty palls on
one, and the man who eternally is
a "funny man" gets to become a nui
sance. The best office of wit is only
to lighten the serious labors of life;
and it is only a torch by which men
may cheer the gloom of a dark way.
When it sits up to be your counsel
lor or your guide, it is a fool's fire,
flitting irregularly, and leading you
into the quag and morass, .
Life may Or may hot be a joke ac
cording to the manner in which one
appreciates it. No one apprecites the
afterdinner speaker more than we
do, but there is always a time for
seriousness and a time for levity.
We cannot joke away an obstacle; it
must be overcome by hard work and
serious attack, yet frequently the
light remark and tho, smile will
grease the axle of prograss and carry
forward the car of attainment. la
this community we all have our
places and our helpfulness. To do
things to accomplish this is the
goal for which we strive, and in
this progress wit may have its place,
but it should not be worked to
death.
