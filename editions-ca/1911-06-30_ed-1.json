Colored DiTnt WrU f rti'
Rev. R. Quarlei, the. colored divine
of this city, is in Bosten, Maiwhere
he is conducting a meeting and .writes
as follows : "
Boston, Mass., June 26, 1911. -I am
in the Athens of the United States,
and since being here I find that the
impression has been brought to bear
that the negro in the South is being
maltreated to the extent that he must)
get off the sidewalk when he meets' a
white man, or ddw and scrape at his
behest.
I am here telling both white and
black that suchstatements are wholly
untrue, and that whenever the negro
in the South' conducts himself properly
he is accorded all privileges of.a man,
and whenever he or she conducts them
selves wrong they are rejected.
I am preaching the doctrine that
amalgamation has no home in our
beautiful SouthlandrHtor we believe
that "birds of a feather flock togeth
er." I am preaching the doctrine that
the Southland, so far as the treatment
of the good negro is concerned, is truly
the land of the free and the home of
the brave. 1 spoke fur Dr. Johnson,
pastor of thn St. Paul Baptist church
last night. to a mixed audience of
white and colored, and took the occa
sion to say that! the best friend the ne
gro has in the South is the white man.
More than a few people shook my
hand and congratualted me upon ray
sermon. Since I have been here I am
sure that the people -have quite a
different view of the South Repsect
fully yours. ? '
