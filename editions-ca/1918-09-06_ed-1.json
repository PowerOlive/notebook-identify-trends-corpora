STANDARDIZED ARMS GIVE US
ADVANTAGE
Twenty-eight different models of
pistols and revolvers, requiring cart
ridges of four different sizes, are in
use in the German Army, according
to the Army "Verordnungsbatt." The
American troops have -one model
pistol and one model revolver, 'both
shooting the same caliber ammuni
tion. Standardization gives the
Americans an advantage in this re
gard. The United States also has stand
ardized its rifte. Both the model
1917 and the Springfield shoot the
same caliber ammunition. Army,
Navy and Marine Corps use the same
rifle' and revolvers.

TWO BOURBON FARMS HAVE

Investigators digging into local
conditions in Bourbon have unearth
ed the remarkable, fact that there is
in the county two farms that are,
as far as land boundaries are con
cerned, practically isolated. These
farms are those owned respective
ly by Mr. W. F. Turner, near Paris,
and one of about one hundred acres
belonging to Mr. B. B. Marsh, on
the Peacock pike. Neither farm. is
joined by any other body of land,
rancy prices. Mr. Hutsell is per
haps the owner of more jacks than
any stockbreeder in Montgomery
county."
The Farmers' Home Journal's
special correspondence has the fol
lowing in regard to the tobacco crop
in this county:
"Three weeks of hot weather had
a telljtag effect on tobacco in Bour
bon county. Hot days and hot nights
blistered the late tobacco and the
damage so far will mount into the
thousands of dollars. Much tobacco
is being cut before ripening in order
to escape firing. The greater part of
the county will have good corn and
tobacco because it was planted early
and when the heavy July rains came
sufficient (moisture was stored up to
complete maturity. There are fields
of tobacco as good as have been pro
duced in years, others are fair to
good, while the late planted tobacco
is drying up In the fields."
The great bulk of the poultry and
egg consumption each year in Amer
ica is the praduct of poultry frocks'
managed by woinen.
by
railroad, by Stoner Creek and by the
Peacock turnpike. There are no oth
ed farms in the county so situated
as far as can be learned, and they re
main alone in their unique distinc
tion. ?S S3 1

"Kash Crow of Paris, brought two
wagonloads of watermelons from
Charleston Bottoms into Mt. Olivet
last last evening and soon had an in

The melons went like hot cakes, at
prices ranging from 25c to 75c."
