Missouri 18, NorthCarolina 12, Tennesse 12, Texas 20,Virginia 12. Total, 175.States that have strong Democraticleaning and may De reasonably depended on are Colorado 6, Arizona 3, NewMexico 3. Total 12. This gives atotal Democratic strength of 187, leaving 79 to be obtained from the doubtful states.Leaving out all other states thatwent Democratic in 1910 we find threestates which will give the Democraticcandidates the necessary votes. Theyare New York 45, Ohio 24, Indiana 15.Total 84. Grand total 271. Underthe new apportionment it will require266 electoral votes to elect, so thesefigures show a safe majority.Inauguration Plans Completed.Plans fort he inauguration of Governor McCreary were perfected at ameeting Tuesday of the ExecutiveCommittee in charge of the inauguration with Gov.

This was asserted byFelix H. Levy, their attorney, whoappeared before the Interstate Commerce Committee of the Senate inWashington to give his views on thetrust question.The independents refused an opportunity to intervene :n the dissolutionproceedings, are moving in the courtfor a review of the case. Should thisfail there they will endeavor to haveConerees direct the Attornev Optipi-qIj to have the decree brought before thebupreme Court. r"The plan proposed by the trbaccocombination and approved by the Attorney Gfnecral and the Circuit Courtat New York is a sham and a subterfuge, knowingly devised by the tobacco company to seem to carry out themandate of the Supreme Court, butwhich really leaves its monopoly unimpaired." This'was the sweeping statement ofFelix H. Levy, attorney for independent tobacco firms and former assistantof the United States Attorney General, made before the Senate Committeeon Interstate Commerce today. Mr.Levy was associated with AttorneyGeneral Moody in the preparation ofthe case against the tobacco trust."The Government," he haid, "hassacrificed practically all of ttte benefitthat were to accrue to the people ofthe United States."KENTUCKY, NOV. 24,NO. 320 MAIN STREET.- Editor and OwnerTuesday and Friday.SIX MONTHSin Advance$1.00STOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTES-GEORGETOWN COURT.

T. Phone 724. PARIS, KY.I1Mikail Mordkm's All-Star Imperial Russian Ballet.Mikail Mordkin's All-Star ImperialRussian Ballett which will be neen atihe Lexington Opera House November27, 1911, is the greatest choreagraphicorganization ever given leave of absence from the Imperial Opera Housesof St. Petersburg and Moscow. Although loath to lose the services ofRussia's favorite dancers, the Imperial Government gave Irapressario MaxRabinofl: every aid in organizing thisbig company. Their object, some observers say, nothing more or less thanthat of the press agent.Indeed, Nicholas, Czar of all theRussians, is called by some the greatest of that ever increasing cult ofpublicity men. He deprives himself ofthe pleasure of seeing his greatestdancers for another whole season, andhas permitted his court musicians, theBalalaika Orchestra, to cross the sesin order that public opinion in Amerciamay be further favorably shaped. Lastyear's tremendous success of thePavlowa-Mordkin company set America to thinking : "If Russia can produce such as this surely the countrycannot be as unenlightened as it ispainted."In appealing to American judgment,Russia chose a medium, too, whichstrikes not only the intellectuals, butthe good plain ordinary people as well.The highbrows flock to see the Mordkin company because the membersrepresent the flower of Russian highart. Business men and others whowould yawn their heads off at GrandOpera or an Ibsen drama, go to seethe ocular" oprea, because theythoroughly enjoy the marvellous dancing, movement, color and exquisitemusic. At the Metropolitan .OperaHouse, which engaged the Mordkinballett for performances during December and January of this yearfinanciers and business men whoseboast is that they go to the Metropolitan only to escort their wives anddaughters sit up and take carefulnotice when the Russians have crowded the house.Everywhere the dancers appear thespectators say to themselves "Russiais the land of a great art." Under thespell of the dancing there fade awaythe old, old thoughts of Russia vodka,the knout and Siberian exile.

H. Haimltonagainst F. P. Bedford to regain possession of his son, which had beenplaced in the hands of Mr. Bedford bythe Louisville Widows and OrphansHome, and by the decision of the courtthe child was ordered placed in thehands of the plaintiff.The case attrcacted a great deal ofattention and occupied several days intaking testimony. Upwards of oehundred witnesses were examined.The opinion handed down by the courtis as follows :"The court permitted the parties tothis action a wide scope in the introduction of testimony so that all thefacts might be made evident. Fromthe evidence introduced the court feelswarranted in the opinion that the following facts were provpn beyond adoubt:"First. That the infant child, CareyHolton Hamilton, is a child of whitebbod."Second. That the plaintiff, H. H.Hamilton, is his father, and that he isnow a man of sober and industrioushabits, kindt & his family and capableof supporting this child in a reasonablemanner."Third. That this child was bornof lawful wedlock."Fourth. That while very young,his father surrendered his custody tothe Christian Church Widows and Or2phans Home, which he had a legalright to do ; that said Home adoptedsaid child, which it had the right to dounder its charter, and afterwardstransferred the custody of said child tothe defendant, F. P. Bedford, which ithad the legal right to do, if said Bedford waB a proper person to have thecustody of said child."Fifth. That the defendant, F. P.Bedford, now has, and has had forsome twenty years, in the communitywhere he resided during those years,the reputation of living in adulterywith a negro woman, and has had thereputation of being the father cf twochildren, claimed to have been left onhis doorstep by unknown parties, andthat said negro woman is the reputedmother of said children, one of whichchildren is a girl now twenty-one yearsof age, living in the house of the defendant, and who has been formallyadopted by the defendant, and towhom a tract of three hundred andtwenty-one acres of land has been conveyed by the defendant ; that this girlhas been denied admission to a schoolfor white children and to a dancingschool for white children because ofthe report that she had negro blood inher veins."Fifth" That few, if any, of the defendant's neighbors visit his home,and that he and his family rarely, ifever, visit the neighbors' homes, whichis evidently due to the fact that thepeople in that community do no approve of his conduct and believe therumors which have been current."With these facts proven beyond adoubt the question arises what is theduty of, the court in seeking to promote.the best interests of this boy.The parent is the natural guardianand protector of his child, and theprivileges and obligations attendantthereon are enjuined by both Statuteand Divine Laws, and until the parenthas done something to deprive him ofthis duty and obligation, there is nopower to relieve him or deprive himthereof."The plaintiff in this case surrendered his child to the Orphans Home,which he had the legal right to do, butthe doing of which does not place himin a very enviable light before thecourt. The facts and circumstancessurrounding this act do not appearvery clearly in this record, but circumstances may readily be conceivedthat would justify an indigent fatherin doing thife. for the welfare of hischild."It was the duty of the OrphansHome to find a suitable home for thischild, and if a suitable home had beenfound for this child, then the father,under the law of Kentucky, would bowithout recourse to reclaim his child.But, if the Orphans Home either byits negligence or, as in this case, byDeing imposed upon, surrendered saidchild into the hands of a person whoshould not have it, it is' plainly theduty of the court, upon application ofthe parent, to restore said child to itsparent's custody, which brings us backto the question, is the home of the defendant, Frank Bedford, the properplace for this child, and is it for ihebest interests of the child to remainthere."Every child is entitled to parentallove, guidance and protection, and itis entitled to grow up in an atmosphereand in a home where it can have itsown self respect , if .all the facts beknown to it, and where it can have therespect of the good people of the community in which he lives, and noamount of money or property can compensate a child for the loss of any oftncse tights.It the defendant has lived in theatmosphere in which this record showshe has lived lor twenty years, andhaving no more regard for the goodopinion of the good people of his community than this record shows he. hashad, and is now fitty-flve years of age,and there is no ground tur the presumption that he will care more forthe respect of his neighbors in thefuture than he has in the past ; and inthis contemplated removal to the Westhe does not even declare ithat he willleave behind him the sole" cause of hisbad reputation in this county.Wealth and the advantages it bringsare veiy desirable, but there are otherthings in the world of greater valueand more to be desired, and it- shouldbe the privilege of ,every child tocherish the ambition and to entertainthe hope of attaining these ends.Poverty is not always a crime thoughit is often such; it is a condition fromwhich one may extricate himself byhis own energy. The court feels it hisduty to consign this boy to poverty,even if that follow, rather than toleave him in the surroundings wherehe has found him."it is therefore the judgment of thecouit that it appears for the best interest of the infant child, ZJarey HoltonHamilton, that he has taken from thecustody of Frank P. Bedford and thathe be placed in the custody of theplaintiff, his father, H. H. Hamiltonmm wmwmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm mtmwm mmiANNOUNCEflENT'Xi$ J. (. .'Cf10Iiand the defendant, F. P. Bedford, isdirected to deliver said child to theplaintiff. H. H. Hamilton; and it isadjudged that the plaintiff recover ofthe defendant his costs herein expended.

To guardthe ports and boundaries againstthose whom the law forbids entry,the government employs nearly 2,000trained men.imffendsLL around the season ofthe Coming of Love asa little Child there havesprung legends and "beliefs, like blossoms ina gracious clime, which testify withsubtlety to the depth of the appeal ofthe birth of Christ. Here divinelyspiritual symbolism and there sweethuman tenderness and pathos appear,and, blended, they evidence the world'sbelief that this was hoth Son of Manand Son of God.An Irish legend tells that, on Christmas eve, the Christ-Child wanders outin the darkness and cold, and thepeasants still put lighted candles intheir windows to guide the sacred little feet, that they may not stumble ontheir way to their homes. And inHungary the people go yet further intheir tenderness for the Child, theyspread feasts and leave their doorsopen that He may enter at His will,while throughout Christendom there isa belief that no evil can touch anychild who is born on Christmas eve.The legend which tells how the veryhay which lined the manger in whichthe Holy Babe was laid put forth living red blossoms at midwinter at thetouch of the Babe's body could onlyhave arisen from belief in the renewalof life through the Lord of Life.fop Thornis not so many centuriesago since there was that holythorn at Glastonhury whichblossomed every Christmas, and, soran the legend, had done ever sinceSt. Joseph of Arimathea, having comeas apostle to Britain, and, landing atGlastonbury, had stuck his staff of dryhawthorn into the soil, commanding itto put forth leaves and blossoms. Thisthe staff straightway did, and therebywas the king converted to the Christian faith, the faith which preachedlife from death.The holy thorn of Glastonbury flourished during the centuries until thecivil wars. During those it was uprooted; but several persons had hadtrees growing from cuttings from theoriginal tree, and those continued tobloom at the Christ-season, just astheir parent, which had grown fromSt. Joseph's staff, had bloomed. Andabout the middle of the 18th centuryIt was recorded In the Gentleman'sMagazine how the famous holy thornwquld not deign to recognize the newstyle calendar, which had then comeinto force but would persist in blossoming as of old on old Christmasday!In those days the anniversary of theadvent of the Babe had certainlymeant more to the common peoplethan merely a time for feasting andrevelry, for giving and receiving; ithad been also a season for holy observances, for they refused to go tochurch on New Christmas day, theholy thorn not being then in blossom.So serious became the trouble that theclergy found it prudent to announcethat Old Christmas day should alsobe kept sacred as before. Only another story of men's weak, superstitious minds? True, perhaps; but theyare better who evidence some spiritualweakness .than those who wallow inthe wholly material, and when wecease to be careful of the cup and theplatter, Ave become not over careful oftheir contents.iemrgChristmas Rose.VOTWTTR f Vino cniT-itnal. parables is the legend ofthe Christmas rose, and it'tells how good things, fit for giving,spring up ready to the hand whichearnestly desires" to give to the Child.It is said that, a certain maiden ofBethlehem was so poor that she hadnothing to give to the Babe to whomkings brought wealth from afar, and,as she stood, longing and mourning,and angel appeared to her, saying:"Look at thy feet, beneath the snow,"and lo! on obeying the maiden foundthat a new 'flower had miraculouslysprung Up and blossomed at her needs.Every since then, runs this story, thisexquisite flower, with its snowy petalsjust touched by suggestions of pinkishbloom, is to be found at this season;and, indeed, its half-opened cups arelike chalices of love, and its fullyspread petals are like a happy innocence, fit symbols for the gifts for theBabe of spotless innocence, whoseheart was the vessel .of love.ias Eve Legends.HERE are several exceedingly touching legends concerning bells, which are heardringing from buried cities and villagesat this season. One belongs to a village near Raleigh, in Nottinghamshire, and the story runs that once,where there is now but a valley, therewas a village which, with every traceof life and habitation, had been swallowed by an earthquake; but eversince, at Christmas, the bells of theburied church are heard to ring as ofold.A similar legend is told of Preston,in Lancashire, and yet another andmore moving one comes from theNetherlands. It is said that the cityof Been was notorious for its blackand shameless sins, as well as renowned for its beauty and magnificence. To the Sodom of the middleages came our Savior on one anniversary of his birth, and went as abeggar from door to door, but not onein all that Christmas keeping citygave the Master of the abundance. Sinhe saw rampant on every side, but notWLiWTWM& trace of Christmas bounty and good,will, and he called to the sea, which,,as of old, obeyed his voice, and Beenrthe city of sin, was burled deep, clean,out of sight, beneath the waves. Butever at Christmas up from beneath thecovering waters comes the sweet call-ing of church bells buried in Been. Itis a legend which appears to tell in.,parable that nothing which ever belonged to the Christ, and was dedicated to his service, is ever wholly lost'from him and alienated from service;.that ever and again something of theirinherent beauty and compelling sweet--nessrises from the depths through all,seeming ruin. 1 1ganger.RADITION declares thatwithin the stone manger 1there was another one!of wood, and that the stone cradle inthe Chapel of the Nativity Is, indeed,the outer manger. Splendid is thathumble stone trough now with whitermarble, softly rich with costly dra-.peries, and radiarit with a silver star,which is surrounded by 16 lamps, evera-lit. But yet more glorious is thewooden manger at Rome, held to bethe veritable manger in which theChrist-child lay. It was removed toRome in the seventh century, duringthe Mohammedan invasion of the HolyLand, and there it is preserved in &strong brazen chest, from which it is,brought forth on Christmas days,when it is placed on the Grand AltarIt is mounted upon a stand of silver,which is inlaid with gold and gems,and the shrine in which it rests is ofpurest rock crystal. In the days inwhich this was accomplished men,whatsoever may have been theirshortcomings in other directions, gave;magnificently to the Church Visible.fstmas Bells. ;RADITION says that thehour of the Babe's birth,was the hour, of midnight,.and legend adds that from then untildawn cocks crow. In 'Ireland it isheld that whoso looks Into a mirror onthis eve will see the devil or Judas,Iscariot looking over his shoulder,surely thought sufficient to drive the!hardiest soul to a thought of the inno-tcent Babe.Another legend tells that, on Christmas eve, Judas Iscariot is releasedfrom that hell "his own place" and!is allowed to return to earth that he;may cool himself in icy waters. j f"Wild and improbable although such,and such legends appear on theirfaces, they bear study and repay itfor we then see that they are full ofsubtle spiritual expression, as it were;that they are parables of certain spiritual facts, and it will be ill for usshould the Christmas day ever dawn,on which such flowers of tender faithand wonder shall appear to us no.more than dry curious specimens from'the dead roots of superstition.Ofoat gtol$tiaa$; means.Christmas means hope andits realization.

This was inor before the year 138, forin that year Pope .Telesphorus died.At first Christmas was what is'known as a movable feast, just as Easter is now, and owing to misunderstandings was celebrated as late asApril or May. In the fourth centuryan ecclesiastical investigation was ordered, and upon the authority of thetables of the censors in the Romanarchives December 25 was agreed up-on as the date of the Savior's nativity. Tradition fixed the hour of birthat about midnight, and this led to thecelebration of a midnight mass In allthe churches, a second at dawn and &third in the later morning. ,sfSLSg."iTtpnvmi&tuiWM utiwuiVMtai- ,-V.. 4THE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS', KENTUCKY, NOV. 24, 1911.M'ijgft.i i aywimmiiiiptiii;C!VHiHnUHlBElVa2lElflKBiEAT REDUCTION SALECLOAKS, SUITS, DRESSES, SKIRTS,WAISTS AND FURS.p-Sl?WiAll Linen Shirt Waists, with double lace collar and cuffs, RQnregular value $1.25 to $1.50 ..

Exchange.'Miss Mary Chamberlain.secretary of the Kansas state boardof agriculture. The outrage has shocked the state, has divided families inLincoln county and probably will bethe means of breaking up manyhomes. The public prosecutor of Lincoln county, who has made a complete investigation of the outrage, asserts that the ground upon which itwas based was entirely false.Miss Chamberlain is the daughter ofJoseph Chamberlain, a retired farmerof Beverly, and had been teaching inin the country schools for beveralyears. Partly because she is attractivein person and inclined to be somewhatunconventional, she has been talkedabout by idle tongues. During the summer Miss Chamberlain worked as aclerk in a store in the .hamlet ofShady Bend, eight miles from Lincoln,the county seat, and a couple of milesfrom her home in Beverly. Goaded onby the women of Shady Bend, whourged their husbands to drive the girlout of the place, these men and a fewboys formed a ploL One of them, Edward Ricord, a barber, invited MissChamberlain to attend a dance withhim. As they drove along the highway Ricord and the girl, according tothe prearranged, were held up. Ricord fled, leaving the girl to the "mercies" of the mob, who, wearingmasks, had assembled at the placewhere it had been decided to perpetrate the outrage. Dragging the girlfrom the buggy, they stripped her ofher clothes, threw her to the ground,and tarred her.The wfiole affair is said to have hadits origin in women's gossip. MissChamberlain, it is declared, was so attractive and such a "good fellow" thatthe other women became jealous andindulged in slanderous gossip. Nowthese women will be forced to standtrial," as well as the men they urgedon to the outrage. Another report incirculation is to the effect that MissChamberlain "talked about" severalwomen, and that the tarring and feathering was a method of punishment.The state is in a furore over thescandal. Money is pouring into the office of the attorney general from allover the state with urgent appeals topunish those who have disgraced thecivilization of Kansas. Locally, too,there is intense feeling. The countyattorney has been threatened withtar and feathers If he continues hisprosecution of the offenders, and haslaid the matter before the attorneygeneral.' The latter has told him togo on regardless of consequences, andhas sent special attorneys to Lincoln to aid in the prosecution.-k- upTRE J9B R0OfflS OFTHEBHRBNAre prepaired to do the best ofPrinting on short notice such asBILLHEADS,LETTERHEADS,CARDS,!CATALOGPOSTERS,and, in fact, everythingthat is printed.Orders for Engraving,such as Wedding Announcements, Invitations,given prompt attention.H- hi SCflW fHr" 'Let .us figure with you onon your next workOur facilities are the best, havingjust installed two of the latest improved Chandler & Price JobPresses come around and see them,work.Our type is new and modernfaces.Cbe Bourbon news,1 04 Issues a Year for$2.00.Advertising rates reasonable and madeknown on application.74liiUUUUihUTHE BOURBON NEWS, PARIS, KENTUCKY, NOV, 24, 1911.-a - - . - MThanksgiving ValuesIN GOOD FURNITURE !m:KHA41fl iitItuiMn v1 .'ra iiAlways Something Newto Show YouWe would be glad to have house- ;keepers drop in on us any day justto look around.Hardly a day passes but we add . ?'something to our stock.The factories are busy at turningout new things, and of course weget our share. , .The other day we receiven a consignment of RUGS, the "most attractive, we think, we eversaw, new in design, beautiful infinish, and sturdy and long-lasting.Any home that is in need of one ofthese ought to get supplied now.Prices $10 up, and worth it.An ad aboutIron Bedssteads&There's a lot to tell you about them,more, we are afraid, than we willhave room for.But let's begin by saying that wehaye a nice large selection toshow you.They are heavily enameled, all sizes.Most of them have attractiveornamentation.The best ones cost the most, ofcourse, but you can get a bed goodenough for anybody, full size,at little cost.But you had better first let us showyou just what our line is like.

Tbe Temp're ofHeaven is the most sacred as well asihe most beautiful of all Chinese re'Oifious edifices. It is used only forImperial worship, and no foreignerhas yet seen the stately and elaboratecerr nonies that take place here onflxet dates every year. The buildingsof which it consists are situated in alarge walled in park in the southeastsection of the Chinese city of Peking.A broad, stone paved road leads tothe temple from the Chinamen, thelargest gate of the Tartar city. Thisgate is exactly in" front of the mainentrance to the imperial palace. Themassive doors at its central entranceare thrown open only when the emperor leaves his palace to visit theTemple of Heaven or the Temp' 5 ofAgriculture.Tne park in which the Temple ofHeaven lies is almost square in shapeand is surrounded by a stout wail,nearly four miles long. Inside it isdivided into sections by other wallsand the visitor is bewildered by thenumber of gates through which hepassses when being shown round thesacred buildings. At each he has topay a small sum to the gatekeepers,who rely upon these tips as theirmain source of income. Some of theInclosures contain majestic buildings; others encircle the grazinggrounds of 'the sacred animals, rearedfor immolation upon the temple altars. The striking edifice, which is generally known as the Temple of Heaven, but is called by the Chinese theTemple of Prayer for the Year, towhich the emperor repairs each spring.to make offerings and pray for an auspicious year for his people, is a land-&&V?r,fh'k&S5oZZr'tisTT:iT515 Wh ' mriThe Temple of Heaven.mark for miles round. Its triple roofof deep blue, gold flecked tiles, surmounted by a massive gilt sphere, canbe seen from the railway some timebefore Peking is reached.It is comparatively a new building,having been erected since 1SS9, whenthe old temple, of which this is anexact copy, was destroyed by fire. Itstands on a triple marble terrace,having a stairway at each of the fourpoints of the compass. When the emperor comes here to worship, thetablets of his ancestors, which areusually kept in an adjoining building,are placed round the single loftychamber of which the temple consists.A long marble paved terrace leadssouthward from the Temple of Heaven past a smaller building of similardesign, known as the Temple of theUniverse, to the inclosure containingthe altar of heaven.It may be doubted whether anystructure in the world excels this forgrandeur and beauty. The marblepaved courtyard that surrounds it,like all the terraces in the park, isill kept and overgrown with weeds,and even the altar terraces themselves are spattered with shrubs andgrasses. But nothing can detractfrom the majestic sinioMcity of thealtar.It is on the main altar, kneeling onthe circular slab of marble that marks- its center that the emperor at eachwinter solstice, officiating as the highpriest of his people (by whom he isknown as the "son of heaven"), worships heaven and his ancestors at- dawn.The previous night is spent inmeditation and fasting in the Hall ofAbstinence, a fitting preparation forthe solemn rites that are to follow.Nearly two hours before dawn the emperor is called and arrayed in ceremonial raiment, after which he makesi his way to the altar in a sedan chair,aad kneeling on the center stone of- -the topmost terrace, burns incense tolieaven, and renders an account of theimportant events of the year. Burntofferings of animals are made on analtar of green porcelain to the southeast of the main altar. In bronzebraziers ranged round the court the-dath sentences and offerings of silknd jade are committed to the flames.Groves of cypress trees surroundthe altar inclosure, except to thenorth, where a series of triple gatesmarks the way to the Temple of theHJniverse, while In the distance be:Jyond, tie roofs of the Temple of4Havea can be seen.?t '&, " ---vHMHBB 3EAR'S IMPUDENCEMAKES HIM TERRTrap Gun Is Rigged Up to Putan End to HisCareer.BRUIN FELLS FARMERInfuriated and Badly Wounded, a 400Pound Maine Bear Knocks WouldBe Captor Senseless and AlmostTears Him to Pieces.New York. "The brazen impudenceof the Maine bear," said a man fromMain j the other day to a reporter here,"is what makes him a terror to thebackwoods farmers of that state andwas what led to the putting of a priceon his head some years ago. It alsoled to the invention of various devicesfor destroying him."The favorite device was the ,trapgun. In nine cases out of ten whenthis gun went off it settled the bear.I have known Instances, though, inwhich the trap gun fell a little short ofdoing its work thoroughly and led tounpleasant consequences for the farmer who set it. As I recall it now. alittle the worst torn-up man I eversaw or heard of was a farmer namedHarvey, who made a trifling miscalculation once on a Maine bear thathad touched off a trap gun."The bear had busied himself forsome time in playing havoc with Harvay's farm products, both of growingcrops and live stock, and so Harveylost patience with the marauder andrigged up a trap gun to put an endto his career. An experienced woodsman, one William Johnson, directedthe arrangement of the trap gun, andBruin Fells the Farmer.fortunately for Farmer Harvey accompanied that citizen when he startedout to visit the gun the next morning."Ordinarily the Maine bear gets intotrouble with the trap gun during hisnight's outing. In the case of f -Harvey bear the bear had put off hisvisit to the baited trap gun untilmorning, and it was just as Harveyand Johnson were drawing near theypot where the gun was set that hetook hol-l of the bait and fired thegun."Hearing the report the two menhastened forward and saw the bear, avery big one, writhing on the ground,bellowing like a bull. He waa badlywounded, but not so badly tut tbaten he saw the jr.en approaching hecould &et quickiy to his feet an.l makea rus'n for them.,,Tohni:on was alart enough to getcut of the way, but the bear caughtlha less experienced Farmer Harveyand felled him to the ground with ablow froi ono paw that knocked himsenseless. Then the bear clawed andchewed and ripped Harvey r such anextent that when Johnson succeededin al last killing Bruin with a club he1001. tho farmer on his back and carried him home for dead."Harvey'3 face was torn out of ailecc giiition. The flesh on his armsfromhi9 shoulders down was strippedolf to the bone in many places andhis chest was frightfully lacerated. Hew;sa't dead, though, as tho doctoriound when h9 got there and lookedhim over. When I came away fromthat region, where I had been huntingabout that tiire, there was a question'" nether the farmer would recovertrom Li3 wounds, rnd I neve heardwhether ho did or not. But the bearweighed over 400 pounds."Makes a Deadly Tea of Wsed.Perth Amboy, N. J.

Theheight of moving picture realism, however, is reached when the two poets ontheir journey through hell arrive atthe giay and cithered cliffs of the Stygian swamps, where the vilest areconfined. The system of signals bywhich the infernal powers send newsof the coming and passing of guiltysouls through the various regions, sographically described by Dante, isshown with a thrilling and overwhelming realism in the picture.The great dramatic moment inDante's poem comes with the arrivalof the poet at the gates of the City ofDis. The scenes here follow eachother in rapid succession, rtaching amoat powerful climax when Virgilseems filled with despair and inclinedto retrace his steps. The makers ofthe film have done full justice to thismost exacting portion of the poem andthe spectator finds himself thrilled andawed in turns. Nor is there any abatement in artistic power and renfietnentas the poem approaches its end. Ihelast circle in the Inferno depicting thepunishment of Traitors is among themost impressive.Every step increases our admirationfor the film makers and renews andenhances our enjoyment and understanding of tho poem. Numerous instances cculd be cited showing howeven in thp minutest detail the pictureseized the conception of Dante andworked them out with patient and artistic endeavor. A few may suffice.We mention the flight of the evil spirits like frogs before the serpent at theappearance l.of the angel before thegates of the City of Dis, the floatingof Francesca da Rimini and her loverthrough air "so light before the wind"the changing of the robbers into hideous shapes assuming a color like thatof paper which has been signed byaflme, the pouring forth upon theearth of the miserable spirit in the circle of the embezzlers. Instances likethis could be multiplied by the dozen.Dante's "Inferno" with a celebratedlecture, special musician and startlingeffects will be presented at the ParisGland Opera House Wednesday andThursday, November 29 and 30, withmatinee November 30.Is the World Growing Better?Many things go to prove that ifc is.The way thousands are taying to helpothers is proof.

Foreshadowing thepractical completion of the Panama canal by July 1, 1913, the isthmian canal commission, In its annualreport, recommends congressionallegislation governing' canal tolls, organization for the operation of thecanal and for government of the canalzone, utilization of canal revenue topay operating expenses and to repaythe capital invested, and other action.Expedition was urgently demanded inorder to advise the commercial worldof the use it may make of the greatwaterway, of the cost of sending shipsthrough Jit and just when it will beopened. The commission wished togive at least eighteen months' noticeof the rates to permit the world'smaritime interests time to readjusttheir routes and to build new shipsand organize new transportation companies. It was also deemed desirable to putthe canal to use as early as possible,not only to secure financial returns onthe enormous capital Invested, but tomake possible the passage of theworld's fleets without confusion or delay. The report showed that the engineers' board has already found thatall the concrete in the great Gatunlocks will be laid by June 1, 1912, andfive months later the locks on thePacific side will be finished, exceptthe gates, which will be ready June 1,1913. Meantime by April 1, next, thegiant spillway at Gatun would be atthe fifty-foot elevation and the entiredam there would be completed by thefollowing winter;.The excavation through the Culebracut, the greatest earth-digging enterprise the world has ever seen, will becompleted July 1, 1913. if the slidesare not In excess of the estimates Ir.that case the exterior channel will besufficiently" advanced to pass the shipping that would use the canal.The total outlay tor maintainingthe canal will be for wages of the operative force, engineerlngwork, santtation and civil administration. Thecommission was insistent that therevenue of the canal should go to paynot only the operating expenses, butto repay the capital Invested. Everylegitimate means for raising revenueshould be adopted, said the report,which recommended that the government should not only supply coal andoil for Its own vessels, but should sellthem to merchant shipping.So many of the ills of women aredue to habitual constipation, probablybecause of their false modesty on thesubject, that their attention cannot betoo strongly called to the importanceof keeping the bowels open. It isalways important to do that, regardless of the sex, but it is especiallyimportant in women.From the time the girl begins tomenstruate until mentsruation ceasesshe has always vastly better prospectsof coming through healthy if shewatches her bowel movements. If youfind yourself constipated, with badbreath, pimply complexion, headaches,belching gas and other symptomsof indigestion and constipation, takea small dose of Dr. Caldwell's SyrupPepsin. It is woman's favorite laxative. You will find that you can doaway with salts, strong cathartics,etc., which are entirely unsuited towoman's requirements.Mrs. Katherine Haberstroh of McKees Rocks, Pa., andMrs. A. E. Herrick of Wheeler, Mich., who was almost paralyzed in her stomach andbowels, are now cured by the use ofthis remedy.

Sharpe. Theelimination of chicken has resulted ina yearly saving to the government of$52,000. The poor soldiers now haveto worry along on beef, pork, mutton,bacon, eggs and fish.It cost the United States 16.14 centsa day more to feed the American soldier in Alaska than It did those stationed In the United States. This isdeclared due principally to the cost ofbeef and its transportation to the isolated posts in the territory.The daily average cost of the rations issued during the year In theUnited Stat&e alone was 22.75 cents;Alaska, 38.89 cents; Hawaii, 24.10cents; Porto Rico, 28.72 cents; aboardtransports, 23.52 cents; American soldiers In the Philippines, 24.56 cents,and the native soldiers In the Philippines, 14.57. Even the Philippine islands shows a greater average costper diem per man. The report showsthe average cost per year per man inthe United States to be $105.96, and inthe Philippines, $114.21.It is interesting to note, the reportsays, that out of a total of $11,864,894spent during the year for subsistence,only four-fifths of 1 per cent., or $96,906, Is accredited to losses from suchcauses as ordinary wastage In issueand transportation, deterioration fromclimatic causes, theft and propertyworn out.The experimental farm conductedby the subsistence department atCamp Vicars, P. I., for th9 purpose ofdetermining whether potatoes couldbe successfully raised In the Philippines has proved the unfeasibility ofsuch a project. Although the conditions were exceedingly favorable whenthe plants first came up, the reportadmits, blight Invaded the farm, andwhile the yield averaged twenty-twobushels to an acre, only fourteen ofthese were found fit for consumption.While the results are declared tohave been a great disappointment, thecommissary general feels that the expenditure of time and funds was wellrepaid.Rangers Exterminate Predatory BeastsSpeak Gently.Speak gently I 'tis a little thingdropped in the heart's deep well; thegood, the joy, that it may bring eternity shall tell.-.

In the westernstates, where bears, mountain lions,wolves, coyotes, wildcats and lynxesare plentiful, the annual damage fromwild beasts runs Into millions. Lastyear forest rangers killed 7,971 destructive animals. The reports, Justout, show that 213 bears, 88 mountainlions, 172 wolves, 69 wolf pups, 6,487coyotes, 870 wildcats and 72 lynxesfell before the rangers' guns.In addition to their efforts after animals that are harmful to live stockand to game animals and birds, forest officers have made headwayagainst the prairie dog, which eatsone thirty-second as much as a sheep.The biological survey estimates thatone grown wolf will destroy about$1,000 worth of stock a year, andthat the average family of wolveswill get at least ?3,000 worth. Thestock killed by wolves. Is principallycattle. Calves and yearlings are generally selected by them for slaughter,but if these cannot be readily had,cows and even full-grown steers are,killed.It Is said by stockmen that wolvesIn Wyoming kill from 10 to 20 percent, of the annual increase of theherds. In some sections of Montanathey are just as bad.'The problem of the exterminationof predatory animals," said John A.Rhodes, a guard of the forest service,"is one that calls for determined andpersistent labor along lines that arepractical, at the hands of men whoare accustomed to the country, thoroughly understand the habits of thewild animals and are familiar with themeans of their extermination."Where hunters are employed, theuse of poison as a means of extermination stands first. Its advantagelies in the ease and rapidity withwhich it can be handled. Where thelabor of a half a dozen men would berequired in setting and watching aline of traps, one man could easilycover the same country with poison.The greater the number of baits thegreater the chances for killing."Wants Pension Office Beauty RestoredENSION COMMISSIONER JAMESL.

IThe fact that McKernan has foun,d aberth with the Battle Creek club ofthe Southrcn Michigan League has puta damper on the hopes of the fansthat he may be retained by the Parisclub to manage the club during thecoming season.Before leaving McKernan recommended several men to PresidentBacon any one of whom would mostlikely come up to the mark in point ofmanagement btit even no wit is difficult to get a line on any of them.However President Bacon has one manunder consideration who he believeswill come nearer filling McKernan'splace than any that have beenmentioned.The Paris President is not inclinedto divulge his namB at present andwill give out no further informationother than that he has been playingwith marked success in the EasternLeague and it is probable that if noother with '. better qualicafitions canbe secured negotiation will be openedsoon after the beginning of the yearlooking to the securing of this man tohead the club next year.The Directors of the Paris club willhold a meeting some time during themonth of January when this importantmatter will be taken up and a decisionreached at an early date that the newmanager may have ample time to gettogether a team that will be up in therunning next season.Two Lives Lost.A fire at Middlesboro caused thedeath of Alexander Chadwell and TomDuncan, and a property lpss estimatedat 525,000.FirstClass Barber Shop.Mr. H.
