Col. C. M. Best, who returned
home Friday after a trip through
Kentucky, came near meeting with a
t serious accident on a bridge on the
Georgetown pike, near Paris. The
bridge stands in a curve of the road
where it is almost impossible to pass
one approaching from the opposite di
rection. As Col. Best approached the
curveh e blew the horn of his ma
chine several times. The bridge is
very narrow and as he approached a
carriage with one gentleman and sev
eral ladies was approaching rapidly
from the opposite end. -Col. Best at
once took in the situation and drove
his machine as far to the -side of the
road as possible. In doing so he ran
into one of the posts of the bridge,
r hadly bending the ront axle of thef
machine. No other damage, however,
was done. This was necessary, oth
erwise the vehicle would have collid
ed and .serious damage would have
been the result.

FIGHTING GRASS FIRES
IN SHELBY COUNTY.
For a week past the section hands
on the L. & N. have been compelled to
fight fires along the right-of-way of the
road through Shelby county. There
are few passing engines that do not
throw out a spark that sets lire to
the dry grass and weeds along the
route. Little damage has been done
thereby to fences or other property,
but rather a service done in the kill
ing of weeds for some time to come.
In some parts of the route the burned
places have stretched along from a
halt to a mile in length.

over Rankin, who filed grounds of con
test in the Nicholas Circuit Court,
alleging that certain questioned ballots

the illegal votes named in the notice
from the total number received by
Parker.
Mr. Parker filed answer to Rankin's
petition, alleging that Rankin had re
ceived sixty-seven illegal votes and
asked that they be deducted from the
votes received by the contestant.

Lexington, Pohn P. McCarney, of
Flemingsburg, William Conley and

sent Rankin. Parker is represented
by Judge' Denis Dundon, of Paris,
