It is not fairto expect anyone to work for yourpleasure and then take it for granted"that you are pleased, when, perhaps,neither words, looks or actions express anything of the kind.It is bad enough to expect grownpeople to understand your feelings,'hut in mercy to the children do givethem the word of praise which theirefforts to help or please you deserves.It is not only right but good policyas well to know this. You have onlyto watch the face of a child when ithas(tried to help you; give it the wordof praise or thanks which it deservesand watch the lighting up of the little face, then take note of its actions- 'and very soon you will see that it iswatching for an opportunity to dosomething else for you; and if you-ask the favor how willingly the littlefeet and hands do the bidding. Onthe other hand take their efforts as amatter of course and see the face- .show how keenly the ueglect is felt.While human nature remains whatIt is, a word of appreciation-willnever be lost on old or young and isone of the best paying investmentswhich can be made. Some say, "Idon't care whether they like it or-not," but that is all nonsense forman, woman or child; we every oneof us feel our heart grow warm under merited praise, and if we de--serve,which rarely happens in thisworld, we try to deserve more next-'.time.Nation-Wide Economy.- To carry out the. program of na"" tional economy demanded of theAmerican people by the war they- must adopt scientific and systematic"methods of economy. Spasmodic andperiodic saving will not fulfill the dejnand upon us.One method that has been proposed and has the apporval of the Treasury Department is for every Americanto pledge himself or herself to econ-imze and save, and with the savings-at definite periods purchase specific-amounts of war-savings stamps."We must give our Nation, we mustTglve our men in arms, all the strengthand support possible. To do this wemust cut our own demands on thelabor, material, and money of thecountry to the limit, and increase tothe limit the supply of money, material, and labor available to the Government. All of the energies and resources should be deyoted to thewinning of the war, and to accomplishthis we must economize, save, andlend to the Government.A definite systematic -plan of saving, strengthened' by resolve and apledge to 'save and lend to the Government, will be productive of thebest results. The savings plan campaign; 4is. now on. Every patrioticf- 'American should make a pledge to' 'save1 and keep the pledge.

S. Naval academy at the annualcommencement at Annapolis, Md.The class numbering 199 men wasgraduated a year earlier than usualon account of the war exigencies.Members of this year's naval academy class are fortunate youths, saidSecretary Daniels In his address,"Because it is given you to prove thatthe age of chivalry is not dead thatchivalry was never more in life thannow. The holiest of the crusaderswas moved b no finer impulse thanhas brought us into this war, to provethat life means more than force; toprove that principle is still worthfighting for; to prove that freedommeans more than dollars; that selfrespect is better than compromise;to be ready to sacrifice all so that theworld may be made better.

HONORROLL IS GROWING. .Steadily,, very steadily, onwardand upward, is the Honor-Rollclimbing in the War Savings Stampcampaign in this county. And pluckily, ever pluckily, that little band ofworkers in the city and county, underthe guidance of Miss ElizabethSteele, is forging chains of gold andsilver around that strong box ofUncle Sam's into which the streamof ironey for the soldiers and sailors "our boys" is pouring.To get on the honor-roll of these"limit men and women" is an honor,indeed, one to be coveted. There isplenty of room near the top, and inbetween, for the names of those whowant to "go their limit" in the purchase of War Savings Stamps, andyou'd hardly expect Miss Steele toturn you down if you came to herwith a request for "the limit" in W.S. S. Try it, and see just how friendlj and courteous a reception you willget. Because it's for Uncle Sam'smen, those "tin soldiers" derided andsneered at by Von Bernstorff andHindenburg, but who are now making the Boches aware of the factthat they are fighters.

Theproblem before us is not primarily a financial problem but rather aproblem of increased production of war eeeentlale and the aaving ofthe materials and the labor neoessary for the support and equipment ofour Army and Navy. Thoughtless expenditure 1f money for nonessentials usee up the labor of men, the products of the farm, mines,and factories, and overburdens transportation, all ef wh4oh must beused to the utmost and at their beat for war purposes.The great results whloh weseek tan be obtained only bythe participation of everymember of the nation, youngand eld, In a national concerted thrift movement. I therefore urge that our people every where pledge themselves,as suggested by the Secretaryof the Treaeury, to the practice of thrift; to serve theGovernment to their utmost inincreasing production in allfields necessary to the winningof the war; to conserve foodand fuel and useful materialsof every kind; to devote theirlabor only to the most necessary tasks; and t6 buy onlythose things which ars essential to Individual health andefficiency; and that the people,as evidence of their loyalty,invest all that they can savein Liberty Bonds and War Saving Stamps. The securities issued by the Treasury Department are so many of themwithin the reach of every onethat the door of opportunity Inthis matter is wide open to allof us. To practice thrift inpeace times is a virtue andbrings great benefit to the individual at all times; with thedesperate need of the civilized world today for materialsand labor with which to end the war, the practice of individual thriftis a patriotic duty and a necessity.I appecfllto all who now own either Liberty Bonds or War SavingsStamps to continue to practice economy and thrift and to appeal te allwho do not own Government securities to do likewise and purchasethem to the extent of their means. The man who buys Governmentsecurities transfers the purchasing power of his money to the UnitedStates Government until after this war, and to that same degree doesnot buy in competition with the Government.I earnestly appeal to every man, woman and child te pledge themselves on or before the 2ftth ef June to save constantly and to buy asregularly as possible the securities of the Government; and to de thisas far as poeelble through membership In War Savings Societies. The2Hh of June ends this special psrlod of enlistment in the great volunteer army of production and saving here at home. May there be noneunenllsted on that daylMay 29, 1918.

AfterJuly 1st, when 'the order bqcomeseffective, all shippers will 'directshipment merely "by express" and itwill be carried to destination byshortest route. George C. Taylor,now president of the American Express Co., will be the head of the newconcern. It is thought that the neworder will result in. a greatly improved express service.will be retained and a schedule of increased wages is being worked out.m m mMr. A. B. Hancock, Chairman ofthe Bourbon County Council of Defense, to whom the letter publishedin another column of THE NEWS,relative to the enforcement of the vagrancy act, was sent, states that therewill be positively no favoritism displayed in its enforcement.The impression has seemingly gained credence that the law was aimedat negro loafers and delinquents, butsuch is not the case. It is the intention of the authorities to strictly enforce the law, which says that ALLABLE BODIED MALES must work atleast thirty-six hours a week. Thismeans anybody who is not engagedin steady work, whether he be whiteor colored. There will be no discrimination. The remark has been.frequently heard on the streets ofParis: "Oh, that law was not intended for making gentlemen work."It was intended as a war relief measure, and gentlemen must take theirturn as well as the horny-handed scwiof toil who has temporarily lapsedinto a period of blissful repose, whilethe other fellow does the work he issupposed to help in.Get ready, boys, and when themorning of June 20 arrives, on whichday the law will become effective,get your overalls and jumpers, or1any other kind of old clothes, or getyour working clothes of some kind,for the law will surely reach you.You will receive an official noticecalling your attention to the provisions of the act and as in the RedCross and Liberty Loan campaigns,no one will be skipped. Whether yoube a bondholder or a pauper youmust show a willingness to aid tfcewar work in some way, manual labor preferred and' now will' be yourchance.fe te toSHEEP SPECIALISTS AID BEGIN. , ' NERS. . .REAL ESTATE DEALS.The "sheep Extension 'specialists appointed by the Department of Agriculture and now at work in fifteenStates are giving special assistanceto prospective sheep raisers in aidingsatisfactory stock and in providingnecessary equipment to insure successful outcome of the new ventures.Old employes j in this way people who are unable toretain for breeding purposes the fullnumber of the female increase oftheir flocks, are arranging throughthe extension specialists" and localcounty agents to have their surplusThe heirs of the late Mr. A.

There is another turn tothe matter, that could be expressedin another way by saying that "wordsare sometimes like things of livingfire, scorching, burning, searing andscarifying." It was speech of thiskind that an Arkansas jurist, JudgeW. J. Driver, of Paragould, Ark.,used in denouncing a pacifist.It- seems that a niinister of theGospel had been haled before theJudge for alleged seditious utterancesand for the efforts to prevent themen from enlisting. The Judge feltthe minister was guilty, but that hewas not convicted because his neighbors seemed to be of the same mindas the preacher. The Judge's remars are peculiarly applicable tothe situation here at the presenttime, not referring to any ministerof the Gospel in this city at all, butto some weak-kneed, pro-Gernian pacifists in our vicinity, that THENEWS takes pleasure in reproducingwhat we consider one of the most remarkably appropriate and well-de-IlaForLend HimI mENOCH MORGAN'SSONS COL 'rn'22BuySAPOLIOror r j iPATRIOTISM ECONOMYwggdt- Act -Don't Talk-BuyNoW$100 REWiABD $100The readers of this paper will .bepleased to learn that there is at leastone dread disease that science hasbeen able to cure in all its stages.and that is catarrh.

Prof. Lyttle favorsTHE NEWS with a translation fromThe El Heraldo, a leading Spanishpaper of New York, in which MayorHylan, of New York, approves thestand taken by President Menocal,of Cuba, regarding the study ofSpanish, as follows:"Mayor Hylan, of New York, hasadded his efforts to the endeavors ofPrasident Menocal, of Cuba, to promote an International EducationalAlliance with a view to establishingand drawing closer the bonds of intercourse between the United Statesand the Spanish-American countries."Mr. Hylan published a statementin support of the suggestion offeredby the Cuban President that the primary step to be taken in effectingthe promotion and durable establishment of the bonds that naturally andlogically should exist between allthe countries of the western hemisphere, was the teaching of Spanishor Castillian in the public schools ofthe United States."President Menocal has proposed.the following elementary outline asthe means of establishing the interests of the American republics ineach other naturally, for the future:1. "The holding in Havana nextautumn of a Pan-American Educational Convention. To this assemblyPresident Menocal has invited theheads of all the universities of North,Central and South America.2. "The establishment of an interchange of students between theuniversities of this country and thoseof Spanish-America. In this mannerthe youth of the United States soinclined could take graduating1courses in Spanish-speaking countries, and, in consequence, wouldknow thoroughly the Spanish language and Spanish-American institutions, which would otherwise bemore difficult.3. "The preparation of young menof the United States for diplomaticand consular service in SpanishAmerican countries. The courses ofstudy which North American students are to pursue should be chosenthrough the advice and co-operationof the Department of State.4. The provision for teachingSpanish in the public schools of theUnited States should be universal."Mayor Hylan has already begunthe investigation to determine thebest method of establishing thesethoughtful educational principles inthe public schools of New YorkCity.""In relation to the translationabove from El Heraldo, a leadingSpanish newspaper of New York, Ishould be glad to invite the attentionof American educators in the UnitedStates to the important fact thatSpanish is the National language ofall American countries except theUnited States, Canada and Brazil, andis closely related to that of the latter country. And Spanish is not onlyone of the two National languages ofAmerica, it is also one of the leadinghistorical and literary channels ofEurope, like the English."Does it not indicate its advantages to Americans when we considerthat our own leading literary menwere, without exception, almost,Spanish scholars of distinction, including Washington Irving, HenryW. Longfellow, William Prescott andAmos Ticknor? Shakespeare -vvas alsoacquainted with Castillian before hebecame so illustriou, to which hisplays bear testimony. And for theprofessional attorneys-at-law of theUnited States it might be stated theonly one of them who ever receiveda million-dollar fee, got the casethrough being a Spanish scholar. Itwas in a law suit involving title to aquicksilver mine in United States dominions, which had formerly belonged to Spain, and where the documents and testimony were principallySpanish, which would have been foreign to the average American lawyer, and the case -as much beyondhis literary capacity, almost as if ithad original title on another planet.I could mention this lawyer's homeand name, but it rendered him sodistinguished that he' afterward obtained' even larger fees in this country and England, where he died after holding office in the SouthernStates and acquiring fame as a politician, whom all will doubtless remember, who know the history ofAmerica."G. BRITTAIN LYTTLE."SPRAYING "CIRCLES" POR FARMERS. Community co-operation in spraying, particularly in the control ofsuch diseases as potato late blightand tomato leaf spot, is urged by theUnited States Department of Agriculture. The department is suggesting to county agents and extensionpathologists the early organization ofsuch spraying "circles" to deal moreeffectively this year with such destructive plant diseases. A community spraying outfit with a man andteam continuously employed throughout the season is both economical andefficient, department officials say, andproved a successful plan in Vermontand New York last year. In one NewYork community the average spraying cost per acre for the season wasat low as 65 cents, while the cost ofone application averaged 13 centsan acre. Detailed reports of the organization and operation of the community spraying circles as they wereconducted in Vermont and NewYork are being made available bythe department workers.Another lad who makes us wearyis the fellow who is always telling jyou that he was out with a Jane lastnight.is sraiOUT STRONG FORNEWTREATMENTJ.
