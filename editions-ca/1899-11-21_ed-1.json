THE PROFESSOR
A Lovd Affair of October and
May
There was a hint of autumn in the
woodland tints where the colors shad
ed from softest gray green through
russet tones to deepest red and brown
and the breeze that swept over the up
lands was suggestive of chilly Octo
ber but the golden spell of Indian
summer lay on the valley touching the
ripe peaches with an added bloom and
wooing the late roses to unfold their
fragrant heart before it was too late
to give their sweetness to the dying
summer
In the rectory orchard under the
shadows of the fruit ladeu trees village
lads and lasses hid and sought and
out in the meadow the children laugh
ed and played and danced to the music
of their own voices
The professor stood at the outer
edge of a circle of infant revelers his
spectacles poshed up oh his broad
forehead his soft Homburg hat tilted
forward to shield his eyes from the
sun
Gray eyes they were with a keen
ness in them that was reflective and
that lent them a clearer vision for
things that time had set at a distance
than for present realities
The iron gray hair was brushed back
and outlined features that were not un
handsome though their sternness gave
him a semblance of severity until he
smiled
When the professor smiled children
understood that the tall figure with its
inclination to stoop was not likely to
prove aggressive and that the learning
contained in that massive frame could
be put aside with the spectacles also
that the professor might have been
young once before the weight of a
laurel wreath had puckered his brows
and powdered his hair with the frost
that comes before winter
He was smiling now and looking
with appreciative interest at the game
In progress
Do you hear what they are sing
ing he asked the rectors wife
Mrs Errington detached herself
from the tea urn to answer carelessl3
Nuts and May isnt it
The delightful irrelevance of child
hood pursued the professor the
sublime faith in the impossible Here
we come gathering nuts and May so
early in the morning Not content
with demanding their autumn and
their spring at the same time they
must have it early in the morning too
all the work at their feet with youth
to make them enjoy it They have faith
enough to remove mountains but I am
afraid the days of miracles are past
Mrs Erringtons glance lingered on
him for a moment and then he travel
ed to where a girl in a white dress
stood nnder the trees that bordered
the rectory garden
There is Evadne she said how
fresh and cool and sweet she looks
Dont you think so professor
He adjusted his spectacles to give a
conscientious answer
Miss Evadne is always pleasant to
look at he said as he gazed with a
painstaking air in her direction at
this distance I do not see her so plainly j
as I could wish
And she is always pleasant to talk
to added Mrs Errington go and
ask her if she would like some tea pro
fessor
He went obediently and the white
figure moved to meet him while the
echo of the words cool and fresh and
sweet floated still in his ears
I am sent to ask you If you will
have some tea he said
Is that meant for an excuse or an
apology asked Evadne demurely
Does my errand need either he
questioned in return with bis usual
gravity
You seemed to consider so said
she in which if you will not think
me conceited I will confess you are
unusual There are people she con
tinued noting his puzzled air who
come and talk to me without any er
rand at all merely for the pleasure of
the thing
A little smile was playing round her
mouth and through her curved eye
lashes the sparkle of her eyes meant
mischief i
The professor pushed his spectacles
up again when people were close to
him he could see better without assist
ance
There are people he said who
might venture to come to you on their
own merits Mss vn I am not one
of thrse fortunate few

means Insignificant They are public
property professor and we are very
proud of them down here I have
even she looked away from him
felt a little alarmed at the thought of
them sometimes and wondered wheth
er we all seemed vy stupid and dull
to so learned a person as you
Stupid and dull He echoed the
words involuntarily while he was
thinking what a dainty outline the con
tour of her cheok and made -like
a pink sea shell and what a singularly
sweet intonation she had
You agree that we are so she said
after an instants offended silence
You add candor to your other merits
professor I see Well the school treat
Is over I think I must be going home
ward Good evening
She stretched out a small white hand
He took it and considered it for a mo
ment
Do you go across the fields he
said or round by the road
Across the fields when I have some
one with me
Should 1 count as some one or am
I too
Too what too candid
Too old he said thoughtfully
She looked him up and down
I suppose that you are twice my
age
More than that I am sure
Has any one ever called you any
thing but professor
My mother calls me John
Any one else
No one since I was a boy
They were crossing the meadow now
In the distance Mrs Errington waved
a goodby to them They had forgotten
about her
Which would you rather be your
self at your age and with your knowl
edge or an ignorant young person like
me
She had taken off her hat and was
dangling it by a ribbon from her arm
Her hair was all raffled and one little
tress with a glint of gold in it kissed
her cheek lovingly
They had reached the stile and he
stopped to help her over it before he
answered Then he said
Miss Eva do you think it is possible
for any one to gather nuts and May at
the same time
Yes if they get up early enough in
the morning
What difference does that make
The difference of not leaving things
till they are too late
He was still holding her hand She
gave it to him at the stile and ap
parently he had not remembered to
give it back Her eyes were like stars
and there was a rose flush like day
dawn on her cheeks
How is one to know whether it is
too late or not
I thought you knew everything
professor And you called me stupid
aud dull just now so my opinion caut
be worth having
I called you stupid and dull Do
you know what I think you
You think me a vain frivolous girl
I think you the most perfect thing
on Gods earth
Professor
I have another name Evadne
When you have quite done with my
hand
I shall never have quite done with
it I want it for my own
Such a useless silly little hand
Such a ping aud white little hand
like a May blossom
He lifted it to his lips and they were
silent for a moment
Evadne is a miracle possible
What would be a miracle she
said softly
He drew her with gentle insistence
into his arms and she raised hers and
clasped thjm around his neck
This is one he answered it is the
Impossible come true
It was never impossible Bhe mur
mured only -you were asleep and
dream in- 1 and now7 you are
awake early in Cje morning
