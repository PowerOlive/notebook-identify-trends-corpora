Wilson Would be Pleased With
Beckham.
A disrJatch from'Washington says :
The election of former Governor
Beckham as Ollie M. James' colleague
in the Senate of the United States
would be highly plepsing to President
elect Wilson.
This fact, which has an important
bearing on the Kentucky Senatorial
hituation, has developed during the
last few davs from talks which corres
pondents have had with close and con
fidential friends of the President-elect
whu know the benefit of fiis mind.
Of course, Mr .Wilson has too much
political sense to mix actively in local
political situations. Unless those who
know him best are very much mista
kpn, he will not declare for any can
didate for United States Senator in
Kentucky. But at the same time he is
looking to the State of Kentuckyto send
a colleague to Ollie James who will
help him put into effect true Jefferso
nian principles.
Close friends of President-elect Wil
son believe that former Gov. Beckham
is the man among all Kentuckiansjto te
of greatest aid to the President-elect
in the role of a Senator. They know
that Beckham will work in harmony
with Mr. Wilson and thai his intelli
gent co-operation would be very va'u
able to the incoming President.
Beckham's idea on public questions
are known by Wilson's advisers to be
in exact accord with thGse of the President-elect.
Both are procressive and both have
tne courage or tneir convictions in
their championship of progressive prin
ciples, whether such principles lelate
to the elimination of the" graft from
the tariff or uhat not. The close
friends of Wilson are not slow to re
call that the former Gov. Beckham
alone among the Senatorial aspirants
was the original Kentucky. champun
of Woodrow Wilsun fcr themesi
dencv and the fight he made for Wil
son at Baltimore is by no means foi
gotten. While it is not probable that Mr.
Wilson himself will give any public in
dication that he would prefer Beck
ham, as that would be considered an
invasion of state matters, nevertheless
the prayers of the Wilson leaders will
be that success may come'to Beckham.
It might be added that the general
view in Washington ia that Beckham
has got the fight won already hands
dawn.
Interest Increases in Hotel.
With subscriptions amounting t
almost S20.0C0 the enlistment of stock
noit:ers in tne new noiei project is uro
gressing rapidlv and the nromoters.
Messrs. Leer Stout and Logan How -
ard, are highly pleased with their
efforts looking towards the formation
of the stock company.
The recent news story published in
the News, it seems, conveved the idea
that the intentions ot the promoters
was to have erected a hotel much
larcer than that which they now have
under consideration and have made a
Statement to the effect that this matg
ter will be left entirely with the di
rectors of the proposed corporation
and that they do not ask for an amount
of money to invest in the propertv
upon which they cannot get returns,
With each day interest in thejproject '
is increasing and before the date of
expiration of-the option on two pieces I
of Main street property it is the opin-1
ion of the promoters they will have a
sufficient fund subscribed 10 insure the'
success ofxthe venture.

That Paris will have another loose

I made known Saturday at a meeting of
the directors of the Bourbon Tobacco
Warehouse Co., which was held at the

J Saturday sale.
During the present season there has
; been a great demand made for floor
. space in the local warehouse, and ow
ing to the limited amount a number
i of croos which, under other circum
stances, could have been received here,
went to the sales in adjoining towns,
and as a remedy for this it wa" decid
ed ny the directors that a movement
toward securinc stock for another
warehouse should be started.
