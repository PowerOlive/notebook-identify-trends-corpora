. COMMENCEMENT.
Millersburg is once more in holi-
day attire, the spirit of patriotism is
in evidence everywhere, many of our
homes are decorated, and quite a
large number of visitors are with us,
' in attendance on the twenty-fifth ari-
nual commencement exercises of the
M. M. I., which opened at M. M. I.
r Auditorium, Saturday at 8:00 p. m.,
with a four-act patriotic play, "en
r titled "Claim Allowed."
The large auditorium was filled to
- its utmost. The play was under the
. direction of Mrs. C. M. Best. It was
' intensely interesting from first to Mrs
1 J. 1 A I 1 fi Al I
last,, umug du Aiuenuau Vivy ui lue
present time, dealing with the pres
ent war. The first three acts were
laid in New York and Colorado, the
-opening scene of the last act was in
Paris, Prance, and at the gates of
Berlin.
The piece was full of patriotism
and loyalty to the cause. The parts
were well taken, and on the whole,
it was perhaps the best of its kind
"ever put on by Mrs. Best. It is a
piece calculated to inspire patriotism
anywhere, and all communities,
' would do' well with its local talent
to put on such pieces, as it would
- keep fresh, in the minds of its cit-
- zens the need and necessities of this
awful war. We regret that we can
not give a synopsis of the work and
emphasize Wie strong feature of every
n. character. So well was the work re
ceived here that almost every one
would be glad to have it repeated. A
good musical program was also ren-
dered by the M. M. I. Orchestra. This
orchestra can now play good music,"
.and we regret that with theclosing
of the school this splendid musical or-
ganization will be broken up, some of
"its members not returning next year,
V-and it will -have to reorganize.
v'-.At 10:45 a. m. Sunday another
large audience assembled at the
Methodist church to be present at the
bacculaureate sermon. Long before
the time for the services the seating
capacity of the house was occupied
and chairs were brought in. At the
appointed time, the line of Cadets fil
ed in, taking their places. A splen
did musical program was rendered,
consisting of anthems, violin solos,
harp and violin duets. This was un
doubtedly the best musical program
ever put on at an M. M. I. Com
mencement. The music was of a
higher order and indeed elaborate.
The choir and cadets were assisted by
Miss Klieser, Instructor in stringed
instruments at the'M. C, as violinist,
and Mr. H. E. Conner, harpist, of
Cincinnati, O. Dr. Kerr Boyce Tup
per, speaker of the occasion, of Phil
adelphia, Pa., was introduced by
Rev. J. W. Gardner, pastor of the
1 church. Dr. Tunper took as his sub
ject, "Man." He took his significant
meaning from the beginning of time
down to the present. He dealt with
him in the ideals of the Greek and
Roman philosophers. He came down
with him through the poetical liter
ature of classic lore, rounding out
his discourse with what he is to-day,
and the various attributes that one
must possess in order to be a man.
It was one of the best sermons we
have ever listened to. It was one that
will never be forgotten by those who
heard it.
The M. M. I. is full of guests from
oil the surrounding towns and many
other States. It is also a home-coming
of old cadets, and quite a num
ber of them are present. They have
been arriving on every train since
Saturday, and quite a number of
them will not arrive until ttiis morn
ing. Thus far there are more than
cne hundred cadets and other visit
ors. The student body are provided
with tents on the campus. The
rooms of the barracks are occupied by
Hie visitors." This is the most bril
liant commencement that Col. and
Mrs. Best have put on, and will al
ways be remembered. See next issue
for remainder of exercises.

STITT.
The Vacaville (California) Re
porter, of May 24 contained the fol
lowing notice of the death of a for
mer resident of Bourbon:
"Mrs. Mary (Mollie) Stitt, aged 84,
one of the best known and beloved
women of Vacaville, died suddenly
Sunday night (May 19) at the home
of her daughter, Mrs. Fred C. Howe,
at Fresno, (California,) where she
had just gone for a visit, having left
here Friday morning with her daugh
ter. Miss Eliza Stitt. with whom she
made her home. Miss Stitt returned
Sunday, leaving her mother in her
usual health, and received the sad
news Monday morning that she had
passed away Sunday night.
Ihe body was "Drought to Vacaville,
and the funeral was held from the
family residence Wednesday, May 22.
In addition to the relatives, many
friends not only from Vacaville, but
from Guinda and other towns were
present, and floral tributes were ex
ceedingly beautiful.
"Mrs. Stitt was born in Harrison
County, Kentucky, in 1834, and was
married there in 1854 to Major W.
J. Stitt. She came with her husband
to California from Versailles, Ky., in
1887, settling in Vacaville, which has
since been her home with the excep
tion of a brief residence at Guinda.
The couple celebrated their golden
wedding here in 1904. Major Stitt,
who was a veteran of the Mexican
War, died in 1907.
"She is survived by two daughters
and three sons, Miss Eliza Stitt, of
Vacaville, Mrs. Fred C. Howe, " of
Fresno, W. B. Stitt, of Tulare, M. H.
Stitt, of Guinda and J. C. Stitt, of
Woodland. Two brothers are also
living, Robert Bradley, of Franklin,
Tenn., who is 99 years of age, and
G. T. Bradley, of Winchester, Ky.
"Mrs. Stitt was a members of the
Christian Church, and exemplified
the Christian virtues by a long life
of unselfish devotion to her family."
Mrs. Stitt was a daughter of Wm.
Bradley and'Mahala Bradley, both
now deceased, who at one time resid
ed in Millersburg, Ky., opposite Mil
lersburg Female College, and are in
terred in the Millersburg Cemetery.
Mrs. Stitt is an aunt of Mrs. Lida
Conway, Judge Harmon Stitt and
Bruce Miller, all of Paris. Mrs. Con
way, who is visiting her son in Cali
fornia, attended the burial.
We don't wonder that tan stock
ings are to be popular with the girls
this summer. Men always did like
yellow-legged chickens.
