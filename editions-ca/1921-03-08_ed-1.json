COMMERCIAL CLUB ACTIVITIES
A. Lyle Dejarnett, of New York,
representing the Community Service
Co., is spending a few days in Paris,
interviewing members of the play
grounds committee of the Commer
cial Club in regard to the play
ground jmovement now under way
here. This organization has- a
school in Chicago whose purpose is
to train in the community service
work.
- One of the most important mattei'3
the Commercial Club will take up in
the near future is the matter of num
bering the business houses and resi
dences of the city. The work was
undertaken some years ago, at the
time when free city mail delivery
was first considered, and was carri
ed well forward. But since then
scores of houses have been erected,
none of which have been numbered.
The complete numbering of houses in
the city will be a great aid to the
mail service and to strangers seeking
information as to locations.
The plan .as outlined by Mr. De
jarnette is to form a community
leisure and recreation service in
whatever form the community de-
bires. The proposition made by the
organization is that they furnish a
man to organize and carry on the
work for a period of three months
free of charge, provided, the people
of the community would prqmise to
carry it on thereafter.
Mayor E. B. January and Secre
tary Wm, E. Hacker were in Fal
mouth yesterday, .where they repre
sented the Commercial Club at a
good roads meeting. The meeting
was held for the purpose of demand
ing a rerouting of the Eastern di
vision of the Dixie Highway, so that
it ill include Independence, Fal
mouth, Berry, Cynthjana and Paris,
instead of Williamstown and George
town, as present contejmplated. Cov
ington good roads enthusiasts are
the principal backers of this move
ment. Delegations from all the
towns along the route were present.
The meeting was arranged by the
S Industrial Club of Falmouth. TUe
principal speaker of the occasion was
Colonel Harvey Myers, of Covington.
