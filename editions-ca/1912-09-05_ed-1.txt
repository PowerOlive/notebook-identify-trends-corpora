Tackett, on Fifthstreet in Millersburg at 1:30 o'clockthis morning, entailed a loss estimated at $6,000, partly covered by insurance For a time this entire sectionof the town was threatened with distruction and only by heroic effortswere the flames confined, to a smallarea.Fearing the inability of the volunteer department to check the flames,the Paris Department was called upon, but their services were not needed. The property occupied by Mr. Wellsis owned by Mrs. Sue V. Sandusky,who carried $1,500 insurance on thebuilding which was totally destroyed.The cause of the fire is unknown.When the alarm was sounded theflames had made great headway inbutcher shop and radidly consumedthe building, in which also was located restaurant of M . P. Wells.The flames spread rapidly to the"adjoining building of Mr. T.A. J ones inwhich he conducted a harness storeand also the barber shop of T. T. Bentley. This building was badly damaged. Mr. Jones carried a smallamount of insurance, while Mr. Tackett carried S500 on his stock. NeitherBentley or Wells were insured againstfire loss.In the path of the flames were thebuildings occupied by the Peonies'Grocery, Farmers' Bank, Home Teleohone office and the postoffice. Framestructures occupy the rear of the buildings in that section, and for a time iiwas thought the flames would be communicated to these, which would haveresulted in the most serious fire in thehistory of the town. TKe fire engineand hose lines were manned by volunteers who battled heroically for twohours, until the progress of the flameswas checked.About two o'clock the Paris department received a call for assistanceand the engine together with one thou-sanl feet of hole were put aboard afreight car to be ready in event theMiilersburg department could not checkthe flames, but at three o'clock another message was received to theeffect that the fire was under control,when the aDDaratus was unloaded.ifif(usmt-iiwmStop, as Every One Does, and See the Window SfjfThe Goods of Quality House,JEWELERS AND DIAMOND DEALERS.Everything First-ClassAlways The Latest6sHello Either Phone 170t1$S .Il?IWell Located Property.The J.
