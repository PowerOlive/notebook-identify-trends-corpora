overturnedat the moment of the wreck Two ofthe men on board the rescued dorywere taken from the water almostdrowned They were the first to perish The third who died was a youngfellow about eighteenFour boats are known to have gotaway from the ship but the captainsboat was the only one afterward seenby the occupants of the rescued doryThe intense cold made it almost impossible for them to do anything inthe way of navigating the dory andthey were compelled to drift helplesslyThe most horrifying incident of theexperience was the cannibalism towhich they were driven by the pangsof hunger The dead body which theyused for food was frozen so stiff thatthey were scarcely able to hack off theflesh with their knives For two daysthe life of the survivors was sustainedin this

Recognised lyOtlier Than Theatrical PeopleOne of the most important outgrowthsof v the sj stematic methods by means ofwiiicli the managers of large enterprises keep the public informed aboutmatters in which they are interestedis the press agent Although most people believe that they know all aboutthe functions of that officer the business is really much more widespreadthan is generally known The averageroan speaking of a press agent has theone who is connected with the theater5n mind He is the man who sends paragraphs to the theatrical edit- inwhich he not only gives the uIpicgprogrammes but works in or endeavorsto do so all sorts of views about h particular actor or singer or the companyin Avhich he may be interested Withmany press agents who act in keepingswith the policy of their employers rnechief end is to keep the name beforethe public and anything is resorted tofrom a description of an elaborategown or a stolen diamond to an imaginary runaway or an impending divorce suit As a rule the theatricalagent is a clever man and to his goodwork the success of many an enterprisemay be tracedOther large advertisers were quickto recognize the worth of a press agentnnd the consequence is that newspapermen have found employment in thatcapacity recently in lines which arefar removed from the show businessbut employ the same methodsOne of the first brariches of businessto employ a press agent was that ofland boomimr The larsre syndicateswnicn were organized to develop cer1 ain tracts of land in the far west foundthat although advertising broughtthem good returns they needed someithing more by means of which theirscenery and climate could beular The press agent was the solutionof the problem The proper man wasfound and departed on- his mission oeducation to the far away places withmen with bank accounts who were looking for new liomes m pleasant placesand presently the country newspapersbegan to bristle with descriptions offarm lands in the domain of the pressagent unrivaled for productiveness andhome sites which in point of climatemd scenery were absolutely perfectand so desirable that the reader was ledto believe that every day spent aVvayfrom the place was a day thrown awayThe land booming press agent has cometo the east and is an important faciorin the development of new sicmmeir resorts and residence annexes to largecitiesAnother field for his usefulness wasfound by the press agent wiuh railroadcorporations in oneinstancca railroadcompany had gained the ill w ill of manynewspapers and criticism of its methodswas a daily occurrence Tfte directorscreated the place of press agent and installed an experienced newspapermanwith power to make investigations onany subject and instructions to makepublic such matters pertaining to theroad as would counteract the previouslycirculated reports A few months afterhe assumed control of the place thepress agent said that the adverse criticism had ceased and that the newspapers had been won to the roads friendshipBut that is not all said a pressagent who had served in that capacityfor years Even society needs itapress agents and there are men in NewYork to day who receive pay for keeping the names of men and women whoare en the edge of society before thepublic These people are jaitly in theswim theimselves but are not averse toearning an honest dollar aaid they manage by hook or by

-sentiment of the home andhave tried to impress upon her that itshould be the abode of peace andmony and that she is the priestess who- f innst1veep he sacred fire ever burning-- ujjon its altarThe duties which fall to her lot in ourcopartnership seem to me to be so lightand easy that I have often vonderedand indeed hme eomethnes felt vexedthat she should look -so weary when 1came home at night have alwavs beJieved and hae often said it ihatwomen hae by far tin betnir pait of theTargain with so little to do and suchopportunities for enjoymentConsequently I have been rather critical of what I have considered her akof system in her way of heraffairs and have showi my annoyanceat a spot on the tablecloth an overdonebeefsteak a smudge on a tumbler or atfinding dust on the top shelf of thebeaufet But innie is a cheerful Utilesoul and always makes the best ofthings even if I am sometimes a littlecensoriousBut you are waiting to hear my experience and what brought about mychange of heartFirst then must tell you that T ami clerk in a banking house at a salaryof 1000 per annum and that beforeWinnie and 1 were married we carefullycounted the cost but calculate as wewould we could not make out that wecould live on it and g o in the set in whichw had always moved without practicing the strictest economy But in thehr ydayof our bright hopes w e thoughtall things possible and so we started inI will do Winnie the justice to sayThat she has bravely done her part Inning always kept the household expenseswithin our income and she made usvery comfortable often with very littlemoney but what has irked me is thatshe should have looked pale and wearyand apparently full of care when inmy opinion she has hud so little comparatively 1o doWe hired a modest flat when we werefirst married and for two years wewvrealjle to keep an inexperienced servant atsmall wages so that Winnie had an opportunity to learn by experience manyof the ways of housekeeping and cooking But dear me that was almostfour years ago and now ue hae Philipand how proud we aire of our little threeyears old son J never could bring-my-selfto think muich less to acknowledgethat Philip ever brought anything intothe family but a wealth of joy and happiness It seems almost sacrilegiousto think that he is any trouble to usand yet since he came into it he hasslowly but undoubtedly revolutionizedour household Our lives our characters and our belongings bear marksof the energy of this little life whichcannot N bottled up and of the spiritwhich is ever rebelling against thetations of a flat for Ave still live in afiat We have been obliged to dispensewith the maid We now hire a womanwho comes in two mornings in a weekone morning- to do the washing- and theother to do the cleaning- and some cooking as well such as a piece of cornedbeef or a roast of beef or a pair ofchickens which is a great help to Win-iie and makes possible little soups andksMUHinMtJlmade dishes which she has learned tomake so tasty and toothsomeLast night Winnie had a telegramfrom her mother who was to come fromBuffalo to take the steamer to day at12 oclock for Europe she had expectedto come earlier and spend the nightwith us and could she not comedown in the morning- nd visit with heron board until the steamer sailedOf course she must go and we were upbright and early this morning and byseven oclock Ave had had our breakfast 0vl Winnie had cleared the tablemade the beds dressed herself andPhilip and was off Yet there was aweary look in her face when she kissedme good by that irritated me Goodby dear boy she said gayly Whenyou go just draw down the shades andsee that the water and the fire are allright and after mothers gone Ill beback and liave everything as nice as ainn before you g et homeBefore she could have got down thethree flights of stairs to the front doorhave no elevator some good orwas it an evil spirit shot a thoughtinto my soul It is just seven oclocksaid I as I stood in the lonely and notvery orderly apartment What a finechance to give Winnie an object lessonI have talked a good deal now I willdemonstrate 1 will prove to her thatshe consumes too mu h time and nervous force in doing her simple householdduties To be sure I have greater physical strength than she has but 1 willmake all due allowance for that in myapplication I can get away at nineoclock and by taking the Ninth avenueexpress train I can g et to the office ontime and in two hours what a transformation there will be JWinnie had left the breakfast dishespiled up in the kitchen on top of thetubs near the sink I would make shortwork- with them I had often whenthe shades were pulled down and 1thought nobody could see me wipedthe dishes for her and it wouldnt bemuch work to wash them But I wouldbeg in in the dining room for 1 meantto be thorough So I swept the crumbs Ifrom under the table and rearrangedthe things on the beaufet but dear mehow the time did fly till I was obligedto finish off with a feather duster 1dont approve of feather dusters theyonly flip the dust up in the air to comeback agiiin jnst where it was before Ihave often said this to WinnieThen I looked into the bedrooms IIowdusty the rugs were 1 concluded 1ogive them a good shaking- Just thenthe front door bell rang- and I rushedinto the kitchen to press the dooropener then back ag ain to the rugs Iought to g et them done before my visitor mounts the long- stairs said 1 so1 flung open the blinds and shook therugs vigorously out into the air shaftthe wind blowing the dust directly backag ain into the room At this juncturemy opposite neighbor put her head outof her window and called me to account ffor flaunting my dust in upon her Oureyes met T should never have knownher to be the lady in silks and velvets1 had seen on the street Winnie alwayslooks the lady even at her work andshe seemed taken aback at seeimr mewith dishevelled hair and my necktieunder my left ear We did not continuethe conversation 1 hastily shut downthe window and hurriedly brushed thedust from my clothes so that I coulddecently open the door for the somebody who was ringing- and ringing soincessantly that I thought the elevatedtrain had run off the track and thatWinnie and Philip were both killedIt was a boy with a bundleDoes Mrs Gunning- ive hereXo you little rascal and dont youever ring- my bell lilce tjiat again Tam afraid that I slammed the door andsi id things But E couldnt stop toget mad for the time was runningalong- as if it had a thousand legs7 4oand things looked worse than whenI commenced so f spread down therugs nnd rushed to the kitchen for Imust wash the dishesI took down the dish pan and putsome pearline in it ac T had often seenWinnie do put in the cleanest dishesand turned on the hot water

to see WinnieI should have thought when she sawthe glare in my eye that she would havegone right downstairs again but shedidnt She wanted to get her breathshe said so she stepped inside andleaned against the wall and talker andtalked and kept me answering idioticquestions as to how we all were andwhether Philip had gvt over his coldetc I have often found fault withWinnie for not excusing herself froncallers when she was busy butlneveiwill ag ain for I simply could not browbeat Mrs Jones nor get rid of her untilshe was ready to go unless I threw heidownstairs After she was gone I wentout feeling quite exhausted and unhinged and I concluded not to say anything this time to Winnie about the object lessonWhat her impressions were when shgot home I shall probably never knowShe couldnt tell me the cruel tinithbut when 1 came home to nigiit and thehouse looked as peaceful and lovely asany home could I felt like taking- off mjhat to her for I realized in some degreewhat she had to do to make it soI found out little by little how surpi ised she was to find the windows openthe shades up the sun pouring in andthe flies walking over everything Worstof all I had not turned off the hot water When it got ready to run it ranfilled up the sink and ran over till inthe kitchen below it began to makearabesques on the ceiling- Fortunately1 had not fastened the door of the dumb-waited-and the janitors boy pulled himself up and turned the faucet before anygreat damage was doneWinnie did not reproach me but saidtlnit she appreciated my motive andthat it was real sweet of me to tryso hard to help herTo night 1 am a regenerated manHereafter 1 shall feel that her part ofthe work is quite equal to mine Besides she has Philip and that meansan unending- combat with compressedactivity In fact I am free to say frommy small experience and large opportunities of observation that not evenwith my strength and athletic trainingand my non obtrusive garments wouldI exchange Never will I ag ain undervalue womans work and while I liveshe shall have my sympathy and helpI however hasten to write this tonight 1 want my good resolutions togo on record while they are fresh andcrisp How f shall feel to morrow being rested and having- recovered myequanimity 1 cannot tell My impressions may not be so clear then as theyare now and T may have slipped backinto my old

following anecdote by Lincolnwas told during Lincolns visit to thefront at City PointIn the course of the conversation thatex cning he spoke of the improvement inarms and ammunition and of the newpowder prepared for the 15 inch gunslie said he had neer seen the latterarticle but he understood it differedvery much from any other powder thathad ever been used I told him that Ihappened to have in my tent a specimen which had been sent to headquarters as a curiosity and I wouldbring it to him When 1 returned witha grain of the powder about the size ofa walnut he took it turned it over in hisband and after examining it carefullysaid Well its rather larger than thepowder we used to buy in my shootingdays It reminds me of what occurredonce in a country meeting house inSangamon county You see there wereTery few newspapers then and the country storekeepers had to reson to someother means of advertising their waivsii for instance the preacher happenedto be late in coining to a praver meeting of an evening the shopkeepers wouldoften put in the time while the peopleere waiting by notifying them of anynew arrival of an attractive line ofgoodsOne evening a man rose up and saidBrethren let me take occasion to saywhile were a waitin that I lune justreceived a new invice of sportin powder The grains are so small you kinscncely see em with the naked eveand polished up so fine you km

far arival powder merchant in the meetingwho had been boiling- over with indignation at the amount of advertising theopposition powder was getting jumpedup and cried out Brethren I hopeyoull not believe a single word BrotherJones has been savin about that powder Ive been down thai and seen itfor myself and T pledge you my wordthat the grains is bigger than the lumpsin a coal pile and any oe

to drinkat a well just by the barnNow I was compelled to admit thatit was some work to give my cows thisattention I know also that there arethose who think it unnecessary to feedmore than twice a day Hut my experience is that it is better for my stockat least to give them a ration at noonThey expect it and are not contentedwithout it they certainly do well underthis treatment I never had a sick cowIn the spring of the year and my herdlooks well and does well through theseasonA man whose cows always look asthin and gaunt as hounds in the springlooking at mine last year said No onecould tell

whitekinds require a deep rich moist soil andone that is rather compact Generallythey do poorly on sandy soil though inthe extreme north they may show anexception to the rule The biack raspberry will do well in either light orheavy soil but they will do best on soilthat is light In the selection of plantswe will remember that no variety of theraspberry is other than biennial Thatis to say one year they produce woodthe next year fruit and that is the endof them We need not look thereforefor two or three-year-old plants Itis best to get one-year-old plants fortransplanting always But while thewood is short lived the roots are longlived often being several years oldBefore planting- the raspberry in anyway thoroughly prepare the soil Inselecting plants get those with plentyor small fibrous roots and set no deeper than they originally were If theground is poor manure in the hill atthe time of planting and afterwards onthe surface working it with plow orcultivator Keep the soil as level aspossible and free from weeds Theraspberry receives very little pruningIn held culture none is given except tacut off the old wood after fruiting Iwould often prove beneficial howeverto prune

More CunningWildcat and the Liess Cauniiis IlntvUIt is curious how a wildcat gets thebest of young wild turkeys said a native of the Juniata valley in the mountains overlooking which the wild turkey still finds secure covert and congenial environment The Avild turkejis about as wary a tiling as lives whether it is young or old and the wildcatknows it As soon as a brood of youngturkeys are big enough and strongenough to be turned adrift by theirmother to earn their own living thewildcats mouth begins to water forthem and he brings his cunning in playto capture them He needs bis cuiirning too aQtlhough they cannot fly yetthey can run faster than a deer and theirhabit of hiding themselves at the faintest suspicion of danger and they arealways on the sharp lookout for danger is as inivariakte as that of theyoung grouse and quail A Avild1ut st ciivds but liUlo chance of catching a young wild tv rtrey by crouching on a limb and pouncing downupon it as the siu pivious fowl surveysits surroundings on every side andabove and below with every step it Jtakes ami every idolitiitui it eats jgIras to be a more than wary beast thattakes it by surpriseBut the wildcat has tactics Discovering a brood of young turkeys heknows that there is no use trying tokeep his proximity a secret so he takespains to let the turkeys see him stealing along in their rear That hurriesihe flock onward but the birds presently stop and ileok back to see if theonemy is still in pursuit The wildcatkeeps liimself in sight but alwayscomes into view of the turkeys as sneaking out of a hiding place He does thisthree four times and then disappears in the forest He has satisfiedliimself as to the exact direction thelock will keep and has left on theirsuspicious natures the impression thathe is on their trail Believing that thefoe is creeping in the rear the turkeysare alert in that direction particularlyThe wildcat knows his business andmaking- a circuit of the voods he comesout far ahead otf the turkeys right inthe path they are feeding along andhides himself behind a log a rock or anyobstacle near which the turkeys -willpass still cautiously gua rding their rearThe flock feed on their way They reachthe spot where their unsuspected foeIs Iving in wait Suddenly there is aspring a scuffle a faint gobble tvndoscattering of the brood and awaybounds the wildcat with one of thenumber for his dinnerDuring the callow period of the turkev hens brood the mother turkeyconstantly watches for and instantlywarns the chicks against another ruthless foe Tlh is is the chicken harwk Itis wonderful how quickly the hen turkey detects the coming of the hawkShe discovers it nearly as scon as thehawk in his soaring place among theclouds has got his eye on her and herbrood Whjle the nawk is droppingdown uipontliein the old turkey uttersa sharp and peculiar cry and instantlyevery chick either scampers to a hiding place or falls over on the groundand simulates death as perfectly asthe possum ever did The preyingchicken hawk will dine on nothing1 butwhat he captures alive and kills Howthe young turkeys know that is morethan anyone can say but it is evidentthat they do know it If they are trueo their instinct and remain as theyfal until the mother gives them the signal that all is well the hawk seeingnothing but dead game as he supposeswill sail away again The mother willnot give vlie signal to her brocd that allwell until the hawk is out of sightand then at ta cluck up will jump everyThick Tt sometimes happens that i-hick is impatient and attempts to runthings itself coming to life before itets the word from its mother Thethat does so is lost for the hoverig hawk will have its talons on it almost instantly although the chick hasrjuickly obeyed ia second order from itsmojther in the bushes and died again-X Y SunSaved liy m Sleiffli BoxFrom Wadena comes a story of anLTrow escape from death on the part ofa farmer and his family who live twomiles out of the town
