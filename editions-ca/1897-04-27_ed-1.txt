Disorderly Greece WillPersevere in the StruggleLondon April 2G What seems likely to be the last week of the war isentered upon Sunday It is difficultfrom the tangle of conflicting telegrams to understand the exact position of affaii sFollowing the Greek defeat at Larissa London opinion Sunday was almost unanimous that the end is insight and this view is probably sharedby the powers as they are alreadymoving to interveneIt is believed that intervention willfirst take the form of a suggestion ofarmistice to which the combatantswould no doubt agree Since Saturday afternoon the British foreign office has been in close communicationwith the other members of the European concert Great Uritain suggesting that the time has now arrived forthem to act The French German andItalian governments have already responded offering to agree thoughthe German government adds as acondition that it will be necessary toenact a pledge from Greece to obeythe mandate of Europe when thismandate is again givenBritish foreign office believes thatGreece will give this pledge as the disasters which have overtaken her havedemonstrated that Turkey still possesses a formidable fighting machine

itsweight in goldIts frame a little set awry its body crackedyou seeDut as I held it in my hands what scenescame back to meUpon its surface long ago I solved the problems dread1 For masters who are sleeping now beneaththe flowers deadAnd many a message here I wrote for onlyone to seeThe little lass who used to sit across theaisle from me3 found initials in the frame by jack knifelettered thereThey stand for one who was to me the fairest of the fairAnd every mark upon the slate that crueltime has sparedRecalls some lesson which in youth thatfairest lassie sharedAh heres the crack which long ago waswas made by Jerry CallWhen to the floor my precious slate he purposely let fallWe did not speak for near a week his mischief caused me painBut when he drew me from the creek wefriends became againHow often oer this ancient slate with manya scar and nickI wrestled with the mystries of the oldarithmeticHow proud I used to hold it up whenever Iwas rightBut when I failed how glad was I to keepit out of sightWhat victories from my Webster on thisold old slate I wonWhat little rhymes I used to write whenother toils were doneHow in my seat behind the stove the museI tried to wooAnd glibly wrote of roses red and violetssoft and blueI seem to see those little rhymes upon itssurface nowI seem to catch some cherished namesbreathed oft with boyish vowAnd round me from the misty past whererecollections meetI hear the merry patter of a score of youthful feetI see the stern old masters kind for all theirstately waysThey brightened though sometimes theyclouded oer my boyhood daysAnd grateful I would weave a wreath andplace it where they lieWith folded hands to day beneath the gentle starlit skyI hear the merry laughter of the girls weused to swingBeneath the hoary beach that cast its shadow oer the springBut from among them all there comes fromout the far awayA sweet and loving face upon the olden slateto dayThe pencil of my memory brings out everygraceful lineUntil there stands before my gaze a figurehalf divineAnd neither sponge nor moistened handwith mischief all elateCan rub a single lineament from off mytreasured slateThe spiders shall not spin again their

theview crowning and dominating thewhole vista veiled a little by graysmoke softened by the blue of the horizon and backgrounded by blue ofheaven there is uplifted against theclouds the historic state house of TennesseeThe scenic value of this imaginativeundertone so lo speak which is possessed by the Nashville exposition cannot be overestimated So speaks Nathaniel Stephenson of the CincinnatiCommercial Tribune who visited theexposition grounds last week In thecourse of a most brilliant piece of wordpainting he saidAnd here in the midst of the battlefields where Tennessee made such avaliant attempt to break from thestrong bond of the national union she isnow celebrating her original entry intothat estate A new day is dawning notonly literally as the visions of the nightfade away while the shadows begin tolift but figuratively in the choice ofthe event to which this southern stateasks all the world to do honor If thedarkness in the shadow of the Parthenon has its ghosts of war and ruin thebrightness that is succeeding it bringsforth the white statue of Athens andthusThe old order changes giving place tonewAnd God fulfills Himself in many waysBut now the darkness of

unexplored by manThe buildings loom vaster and vasteras the blue shimmer grows steadilvdeeper The dome of the Agriculturalbuilding is crowned by the stars themselves The tower of the auditoriumsprings away into the very heart ofheaven The pillars of the Parthenonhave the height of mountains Thestatue of Athens is some immeasurablyvast creature which isnot to be approachedAnd all these monsters of the dawnhave the strange effect of being asleepThey are buildings no longer they areliving creatures wrapped in dead slumber gazing eastward with sightlesssyes that will be awakened by the dawnPerhaps it is the continuous though imperceptible changing of the degree ofdistinctness in their details due to thefcteadily growing light in the heavensthat produces this uncanny effect ofbeing alive But however produced itis there So real is it that one catchesones self treading lightly for fear ofwaking these enormous creatures thatare all about oneIn concluding his letter Mr Stephenson says The men who conceivedthis building must have had qualitieswhich it perpetuates sweetness nobility loftiness calmness strength Therewas Tennysons ideal ofThat srentlenessThat when it weds with Manhood makes

decide upon the rates to theTennessee Centennial expositionIt was one of the most harmoniousmeetings ever held by that body forthey each knew that the motives thathad prompted the enterprise werethe general good and not forthe benefit or aggrandizement of anyindividual or corporationThe members of the passenger association with the liberality that has always characterized their movementswhen the interests of the general publicare concerned determined to aid theExposition association in their greatwork and the consequence is that therates are more advantageous fromevery standpoint than any

fanciful and picturesque dance at the grand festivals olthe imperial court especially- as veryspecial rales prevailed there It is welknown that the late Kaiserin Augustastrongly objected to waltzing and scdoes the court of Berlin The consequence is that a kind of gallop was invented for Berlin a two thned movement danced to the music of the waltzbut not at all resembling the old deuxtemps waltz In Mecklenburg the walt7is never danced at all at court the reason for this being as it is said thatthcGrand Duchess Marie does not like dancing Moreover almost everywhere atGerman courts the slow waltz waslooked down upon as bad style Goocstyle depends ipon the leaders of fashion and so the slow waltz has been pronounced as the correct kind to bdanced at the court of Stuttgart thiswinter Both

probablynever be knownFat couldhave told of itdoubtless nd so too could Charleybut neither the cook nor the laundryman ever gave his confidence concerning-the feud and as you shall hearneither is now available for testimonyCharley Jo Lee being- a washer ofshirts was rather looked down upon byHong Fal who cooked at the CheerfulHeart restaurant and nivished the lumlermen and sheep drovers with hisstewed tripe Hong- Fat had a decidedopinion that any Chinaman who wasa Chinaman would be unwilling- to remain at the shirt-washing- industry anylonger than it would take to negotiateiwith some restaurant and as CharleyJIo Lee had been in the country 11 yearsand still purified other peoples clothesHong- Fat reviled him Perhaps thisscorn of thj cook had some considerable part in building- up the enmity itis only a surmise however and I donot guarantee itThe wickedness of this slory beginsrig lit here It was Charley Go Lee whotalking- with other Chinamen fromdown the railroad became inspired andlearning- where the United States marshal was to be found visited bim andspoke -wisely but in unfriendly manner of Hong- Fat the cook Bereft ofits liquid Charleys Englishwas sufficient to notify the official thata Chinaman without a certificate of residence was to be found in the CheerfulHeart restaurant at Gevserville at amtime a government representative wouldcare to call And the very next weeka man with a star and a document calledat Ceyserille and when the down trainpulled out a mournful and murmurousChinaman was on board and dinnerwas late and poorly cooked at the restaurant of the Cheerful Heart that dayFirecrackers were however burned inthe laundry of Charley Co Lee andfestivity reigned thereHong- Fat did not want to leave thecountry His devotion to America andher likable qualities migiif well serveas an example for the instruction ofyoung- persons of lighter complexionthan his own fie had been foolish innot registering- long- ago when the opportunity came but being a stubbornChinaman and also believing- that hisremissness would nev r be discoveredhe had held back As he looked from-the train and saw the decoration onCharley Co Lees laundry and moreover saw that industrious person whowith great virtue and foresigiit hadobtained his certificate at as early adate as it could be issued to him greatanger came into Hong- Fats heart forCharley was leaping- and dancing- andlaughing at him The train whirled onits narrow gauge way down past therestaurant the back of which lookedupon the railroad and Hong- Fat sawthe meat man with his package pounding at the rear door and he knew hewas pounding- for him and that hewould never open the door to that meatman again He saw the three chickenswhich he had intended that very evening to put into a pie saw them scutching about in the rubbish of the dooryard and he realized that inanv a davwould pass before he would again decapitate a chicken to make a lumbermans holiday Many a day Why itwould never be again He would betaken before white men all of whomhated Chinese and most of whom wouldreadily lie glibly about his evil character and then he woidd be bunchedinto a ship and be sent back in disgrace1 and poverty to China the China fromwhich he had set out so hopefully yearsbefore to make a fortune in the new-worldIt is not given even so wise a man as adeputy United States marshal to knowwhat is passing through a Chinamansmind and so the official was utterly unprejftired when the heathen with asudden cry dived through the windowof the coach in a passioii for the libertybeyond It was a dark night and although the train was stopped at oncethe hurried search revealed no sign ofHong Fat The conductor was unwilling to delay longer than was necessaryand telling the marshal he would better go on to the next town and waitfor morning he signaled to pull outThe narrow gauge train had traveledmany milepoin the town of the Cheer-neart restaurant a nd v fcs now rrclof the -wooded country and into the hotoven of the desert The marshal accepted the adviceAlthough he had mocked at CharlejGo Lee for being less advanced thanhimself Hong Fat was really a resourceless and uninventive Chinaman andthere was nothing high grade or knowing about him except his miraculousability in the matter of stewed tripeSo leaping from the window to avoidbeing deported from the country hewas fond of he knew not what to donext He could only walk down therailroad track and walk and wailc hoping to arrive somewhere where helpwould be given He had broken a riband had fearfully plowed his face infalling but it was an unimportant riband he did not mind his facial appearance The road through the desertwas long and gray and parched whenthe daylight came after a smotheringnight and afterward the two lines ofrails flashed a glittering invitation tofarther vistas of quivering heat asthough it were the way straight to thehome of the damned The night wasbeautifid on the far away line of mountains as he hailed the sun at daybreakil ten oclock the sun was a furnacedropping a heat that was almost liquidupon him His broken rib pained himand his face smarted and he staggeredon down the line whither he knew notBy and by the sound of an approaching train came to him and he lookedahead and saw the black blur at theends of the pointed lines of steel Hedropped to his knees and crept off intothe desert like a poisoned dog and waited in the sage for the train to passThen with the insufferable sun stillbeating upon him he resumed his wearyjourney At night he came stealthilyupon a village of three houses and hewanted to steal water there but he wasafraid for a dog barked He wentaround the handful of huts hungry andburning within but fearful of thatdread horror deportationTt was thus that the aimless rudderless Hong Fat traveled for a full weekhiding from trains mourning for waterand with festering wounds He beganto see things on the desert alongsideand sometimes he dodged into the sagewhen no train was coming He talkedto himself too and altogether he wasan evil looking creature when CharleyGo Lee turning an abrupt curve of therailroad came upon him sitting on afallen tree for the traveler had nowreached the timber country out ofwhich he had been so ruthlessly haledthe week before Charley Go Lee lookedat the returning wanderer in vast surprise He called to him in Chinese forhe could hardly believe that this crazycreature was the Hong Fat of the Cheerful Heart and asked him who he wasThere was a wild and maniacal cry ofrage heard in the timber camp up themountain side and Charley now knewpositively that Hong Fat had come backIkI Ilk VTHE FIGHT TVAS ONThe thing- which the laundrymaii saidwas that Hong Fat was a bad man andthat he must give himself up to be heldby him Charley Go Lee for the whiteman who would give a reward in moneyand that which Hong Fat said was wildand animal like and unintelligible andthe two enemies grasped at each otherand the fight was onCharley saw that his foe was thinand pale and weak to look upon but hedid not see that he was a maniac withthe strength of a maniac even counting the broken rib as a hindrance Thelong snaky wasted arms of the fugitiveof the desert closed around the washermans waist and even as Charloyhooked hisi own arm about the neck ofthe runaway to choke him and subjugate him the train whistle was heardaround the curve The Iaundrymanknew its import and tried to tug himself and his prisoner off the line oftrade but Hong Fat cleneehed theharder and dragged his foe with himto the space between the rails wherethey wallowed and shrieked Charleyin fear and the desert man in crazedrageThus their quarrel endedWhat originally started the feud noman knows as I told you in the beginning Chicago IteeordOld Theater TicketsDuring the last few years a largenumber of small metal plates have beenfound at diggings in- Athens and Piraeus and they were commonly considered to be small symbols The Greekarchaeologist Svoronos has now demonstrated beyond doubt that the metalplates were used as tickets of admissionto the Theater of Dyonisos about thetime of Lycurgus The images on thesetheater tickets certainly the oldest oftheir kind in existence show either thehead of Pallas Athene turned to theleft or the head of a lion and the letters of the alphabet in single double ortriple arrangement It appeals therefore that the laws introduced by Lycurgus which had such a great influenceupon Athenians in all walks of life extended also to the admission to theaterswhich was also probably regulated bJhimT Pliiladelphia Eecorc1MOST INTERESTIN BURYINIncident Was Told in a South Carolina Churchyard fBeen through the buryin groundI know about most ail the line monuments volunteers

occasion when herequested a famous artist to paint hisportrait he said I have never had vsatisfactory picture If you can hidethat scar lifting bis finger towards hisface and give me a good picture youwill not only increase your renown butI promise you a fortune beside Thesequel is that the artist so thoroughlysucceeded in bringing out prominentlythe leading characteristics of Alexander at the same time hiding the scarwhich if seen would mar the pleasure oflooking at the portrait and detractfrom the full appreciation of his mostnoble qualities that the conqueror wasnot only delighted and satisfied but healso carried out to the letter his promises of fortune and fameIn this little anecdote is contained agood precept for the guidance of friendsIt is characteristic of some people tomagnify scars It is true that aboutus there are not many people whocanbe called perfect yet if others tried asassiduously to extol their virtues andgood qualities as sometimes they seemto strive to remind them and othersof their faults and follies what a wonderful change the world would seeThere would be little motive for faruiiyor social gossip for our scars wouldeither fade or be altogether concealedIndeed some of our acquaintanceswould hardly be recognized but onthe other hand it would be a pleasureto know that there are among us somewho like Alexanders good portraitpainter find pleasure in thus hiding thescars and bringing out the best thatmay be discovered in friends and acquaintances This hiding of the faultsand Aveaknesses of our friends is a rareand beautiful trait of character Itis a friendly virtue which we shouldstudy to cultivate for in speaking ofones friends it is always an after-satisfactionto remember that we have dealtkindly in their behalf Boston BudgetTo Preserve Flowers ColorsThe natural colors of flowers maybe preserved with almost their originalbrilliancy after being dried very thoroughly in sand The Gardeners Monthly which suggests this simple processfor manufacturing- artificial flowet bstates that the most delicate flowerscanbe made in this way to look for several years as though they had beenfreshly gathered The flowers shouldbe placed in a pan or other disli andcovered with perfectly clean dry sandThis should be sifted over the flowerso as not to break or bruise the petalsEvery chink and cranny should be filledwithout disturbing the natural positionof the leaves When the pan is full andevery crevice has been filled solidly theflowers are allowed to dry for severaldays It is often found effective towarm the sand and keep the buriediiowers in a -warm oven The sandshould then be removed great care bfiing taken not to break or tear theleaves -which will be very brittle JNY WorldHickory Nut Filling for CalceOne cupful of

in thoseparts and when the winter rains fallswhich arc very heavy the waters comeroaring down the mountains in greattorrents When the rains are over andthe waters from the mountains haveceased to flow they search the bedsof the torrents nnd find plenty of diamonds In summer also there are plenty to be found in the mountains butthe heat of the sun is so great that itis scarcely possible to go thither noris there then a drop of water to befound Moreover in those mountainsgreat serpents are rife to a marvelousdegTee besides other verminand thisowing to the great heat The serpentsare also the most venomous in existence so that anyone going there runsfearful peril for many have been destroyed by these evil reptilesNow among these mountains thereare certain great and deep valleys tothe bottom of which there is no access Wherefore the men who go insearch of the diamonds take with thempieces of flesh as lean as they can getand these they cast into the bottom ofthe valley Now there are numbers ofwhite eagles that haunt these mountains and feed upon the serpents Whenthe eagles see the meat thrown downthey pounce upon it and carry it upsome rocky hill top where beginto rend it But there are men on thewatch and as soon as they see thatthe eagles have settled thev raise aloud shouting to drive them awayAnd when the eagles are thus frightened away the men recover the piecesof meat and find them full of diamondswhich have stuck to the meat downin the bottom For the abundance ofdiamonds down there in the depths ofthe valley is astonishing but nobodycan get down and if one could it wouldbe only to be at once devoured by theserpents which are so rife thereThere is another way of getting thediamonds The people go to the nestsof those white eagles of which thereare many and find plenty of diamondswhich the birds have carried off withthe meat that was cast into the vallejsAnd when the eagles themselves aretaken diamonds are found in theirstomachsSo now I have told you three differentways in which these stones are foundNo other country but this kingdom ofdutfii produces them but there theyare found both abundantly and of largesize Those that are brought to ourpart of the world are only the refuseas it were of the finer and largerstones For the flowerr of the diamondsand other large gems as well as thelargest pearls are all carried to thegreat khan and other kings and

by landfrom his residence at the Yildiz ioskto the old seraglio for the purpose ofpaying his annual devotion to the holycoat of Mohammed which is preservedin a great box in the innermost sanctuary of the imperial treasury The extent to which this garment is veneratedby all believers may be estimated bythe- fact that the principal and mosthighly cherished title of the sultan Isthat of guardian of the holy mantleThis robe which It is needless to sayis green was brought to Constantinople by Sultan Selim along with the keysof the holy cities of Medina and Meccafrom Cairo where they had been preserved until that time in the keeping ofthe caliphsThis worship of the mantle by thesultan is the most solemn and imjiortant religious fiTnction which the Turkish ruler is called upon to
