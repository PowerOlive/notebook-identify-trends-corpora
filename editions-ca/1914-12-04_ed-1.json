THEORY OF DIPHTHERIA IN
RABBITS GIVEN A HARD JOLT.
The theory that diphtheria has
caused the death of hundreds of rab
bits found dead in the fields of Nich
olas, Pulaski, Pendleton and other
counties, apparently is refuted by the
report of Dr. Lillian South, of the
State Board of Health laboratory,
Bowling Green, who has examined the
carcasses of two of them found in
Nicholas county and found no trace of
diphtheria.
These two rabbits were sent by a
game warden to J. Q. Ward, executive
agent of the Game and Fish Commis
sion. He sent them to the laboratory.
Dr. South said in her report that she
would make a thorough examination
to determine if possible the cause of
their death.
