COTJKT SAYS WOMEN HAVE THE
RIGHT TO SMOKE
Smoking by women in hotels and
restaurants is all right in the eyes of
i he law, as women have the same
rights in that direction as men, Pp
hce Judge John J. Riley ruled ;n
City Court in Lexington, when Beu
lah Hicks, 24 years old, of Nicholas
ville, was presented before the court.
Mrs. Hicks, it was testified by Pa
trolmen Robert Hale and 'Johnson,
Mqnday night was smoking a cigar

way, when the two patrolmen enter
ed. They warned her concerning
smoking in the public eating place
and later a change of vagrancy was
placed against her.
DECIDES
WOMEN MAY
ON JURIES
SERVE
All doubts as to the right of wo
men to act as jurors was brushed
aside by Charles I. Davson, Attorney
General, in a written opinion stating
that the Federal constitution and
Kentucky law give them the right to
serve on juries.
The adoption of the nineteenth
amendment to the Federal constitu
tion enfranchising women, made cit-
I izens of them within the meaning of
the term, according to Air. uawaon.
The inquiry as to the rights of
women to act as jurors came from
Louisville, where there has been
considerable agitation recently for
obtaining women as jurors. The first
qualifications for jury service, Attor
ney General Dawson says, is that of
citizenship; the second is that he or
she must be 21 years of age, and
then finally a householder.
He has no doubt that any woman
accepted for jury service would be
able to quality-along all of the Hnei.

CHURCH PROPOSES TO OUST
RENT PROFITEERS
A resolution, under which "rent
profiteers" wcmld be ousted from the
churches, adopted by the Pittsburg
Baptist Ministers' Association, was
made public. ' Unwarranted rent ad
vances constitute an un-Christian
"Phariseeism," acording to' the reso
lution, which urged all Pittsburg
ministers "to combat gouging land
lords, to take a prominent part in
community protests, against these
wrongs, and use the influence of
their ministerial associations to pre
vent new burdens of greedy extor
tion being imposed upon thegeneral
public." Officials of the Baptist or
ganization said that they would urge
the Pittsburg Union Ministerial As
sociation to adopt a similar resolution.
