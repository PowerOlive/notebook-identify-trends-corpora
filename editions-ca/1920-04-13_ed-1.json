HOW TO HURT PAEIS
One way to keep Paris from go
ing forward is just to stand around
and kick all the time about what
the people who strive to lead are
doing. Don't take any part your
self just kick. It's so much easier
to find fault than to do things. The
town needs pushers and helpers, not
knockers and hammer-users!
There are some nice cozy corners
in the stock market.
