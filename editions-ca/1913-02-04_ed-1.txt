IThe News has'frequently urged thebusiness'men of Paris to beware of thetraveling advertising solicitors butthey continue to fall for the old gamethat has existed for years, and spendtheir money for advertising fromwhich they receive little or no benefit.It bearsout a previous statement thatlocal merchants are easy to tumbleinto the clever schemes of these menwho get their money with little endeavor, spend nothing in the town andleave the advertiser with nothingmore or less than scrap paper.A few days ago one of these smoothtongued artists came to to wn and helda number of merchants up with asaheme. His plan was vo have printeda pocket directory of Paris which included a railroad and interurban timetable, lodge directory, driving distancefrom Paris, the city officials and abrief sketch of the town. On eachpage was a liberal amount of advertising which the merchants, generouslydonated.The promoter of this little schemecame to top'n on atieaily train, workedthe advertising end of the program,wrote his sketch and-.the job 6wasturned over to a local "nrinter whocompleted il the-sume day. His collections were made and he departedwith a considerable sum of money.The News does not contend that advertising of any sort is not a goodthing, but it does contend that thereis a legitimate way to advertise andwhereby the merchant will get thefull benefit onf the money he willnut into it. Newspaper advertisingis the one kind that will nay, and ifmerchants of Paris could be broughtto this realization they would be saveda lot of money in the course of a yearby turning down the smooth proposition of the man who spends a day intown and clears out with a sum ofmoney which if SDent with local newspapers would increase their businessand eventually get back to the manwho Epent it this wav.

They met in Louisville at a hotel, and, it is said, all ofthem agreed that not only is theredanger of the schools being made tobear the brunt of. the retrenchmentnut there are signs that some politicians in their desperation will endeavor to save the privilege heretofore enjoyed by their favored friendsbymakinga big showing of economyin educationaljexpenditures.The danger, as they see it. is themore acutebecause there is always tobe expected a reactionary tendencyafter popular enthusiasm has reachedthe highjpoint attained, as it has inthe campaign for educational advancement that has been going on in Kentucky for several yeara. Under "coverof this, they believe, politicians canundo much that has been accomplished and hamperfurtber progress unlessthe school teachers and trustees standtogether to hold what has been gainedand keen public sentiment in theircommunities in support of the schools.This feeling emphasized the importance of brjngingjthe trustees into theKentucky Educational Association,and vigorous efforts are being putforth to urge them to attend and organize as a department ot it.

Hamlett says stepsroBst be taken at once to form an organization to counteract the movement that threatens educational advancement.Phone Merger May Jail ThroughThe services of Attorney GeneralGarnett were requested Friday by acommittee of citizens of Woodford,Jessamine, Scott, Bourbon and Fayette counties, who visited Frankfortto aid them in a suit to test the constitutionality of the recent act of theLegislature providing for the mergerof competing and parallel telephoneand tplfieranh lines, with the consentof theFihcal courts and the City Councils of the various cities and .counties.The committee comprised ThomasSmith and S.

But I should do as other blindmen have done before me: I shouldtake God's rod and staff for my guideand comfort, and wait patiently fordeath to bring better light to noblereyes. O ye who are living in the darkness of sin! turn before it is too lateto the light of holiness, else death willbring to you not recreation, vbut retribution.

Sponge fishing, is one ofithe few industries, and is carried onchiefly by Greeks. Since sharks havepeached that coast from the Red sea,jby way of the Suez canal, the spongefishery has become a dangerous business. . The men remain several miniites under water, a rope being tiedground the body, which the diverjjerks when he wishes to be hauled up-jwlth his catch. Some few years ago. sponge fisher dived down with ajm&rble slab in his hands, to make himieink more quickly. A shark met himand half swallowed him head first,lacerating him badly, Tjut, not appreciating the marble, .ejected them both.JThe man let go the slab, and madeor the surface, the short-sightedJshark luckily going after the marble.Vhere Turks Crushed Serbs.It "was on the banks tff the Maritz,"bear Adrianople, in 1364, that theTurks first came into conflict with theiyoung Slavonic races the Servians,jthe Bosnians, the Bulgarians. Louisjjl., king of Hungary and Poland, withithe princes of Bosnia, Servia and Wal-achia, had decided to conquer thejsultan, a task that the Greeks hadbeen unable to manage. The Turksfwere only half as strong as the allies;ibut the commander took advantage oftheir intoxication to make a suddennight attack. The Slavs were arousediby the beating of the Turkish drums."""The Ottomans were upon them beforethey could stand to arms. They werelike wild beasts scared from theirHair," says Sa'd-ud-Din; "speeding frdmthe field of light to the 'waste offlight, those abjects poured into the'stream Maritza, and were drowned."The spot can still be seen on the mapas Sirf Sindughi, the "Serbs' rout."Wonderful Transparency of Metals.Gold leaf of a thickness of four mil"lionths of an inch will, in a cold state,.allow the green rays of light to passthrough, but this the only exampleof light penetrability among metals inis. cold state. Recently, however, scientists have turned their attention to the'fact, discovered by Faraday, that gold.nd silver foil become transparent ifIheated. Thus it has been found thatfat about 1,000 degrees F. gold foil.somewhat thinner than that alreadymentioned becomes completely transiparent to white light, while a verythin film of silver placed on a glassiplate becomes transparent at about740 degrees P., the combination of silver and glass no longer acting as aTmirror. Several other metals havelieen found to possess the same property when intensely heated, but aluminum, despite its lightness, has so farfproved impenetrable by light.Blind Girls at the Phone.The blind telephone girl has beenItried and proven a success in Baltimore. Miss Elsie Sonderman, thetfirst, operates the exchange for the;Sheppard-Pratt asylum. Recently theMaryland School for the Blind turnedlout five other well trained girls andthe managers believe they can openthis field of work to many others.'These girls are working with the regulation switchboards, but a new kindof board is being planned which willsimplify the training and increasethe efficiency of the sightless operators. The most difficult board nowoperated by blind girls is that at theYoung Women's Christian association(In Philadelphia. Like a hotel, the association club and home has 200 rooms.and eight pay stations, and the blindoperators are as accurate and quickas other girl operators.His Support Poor.A Mississippi Democrat made sevleral efforts to get a congressionalfnorinlnatlon.

ChicagoEvening Post.American Character in 1793.The arrest of Midad Mitchell, ayoung American and protege of Baronvon Steuben, by the Spanish commandant of New Madrid, Mo., In 1793,bn the charge of espionage, gave' Don.Manuel Gayoso de Lemos, lieutenantgovernor of Upper Louisiana, an opjpbrtunity to express his opinions ofAmericans. "Writing to Baron de Carlondelet, lord governor at New Orleans,Ihe said: "In general that (inconsistency) is the character of the majorityjot Anglo-Americans. Yet another feature of their character is that if theyfind an abode in another country theyforget their own and for a time usually serve with efficiency."Bucolic Notions.Dr. Harvey W.

He flung his book halfway across the desk In front of him,got up laggardly, and said, balancinghimself with both hands upon thedesk-top:"'Patches are premeditated poverty. You know that yet you doworse than patch. Is this the third orfourth time you've " made over thathat?, I'm sick of seeing it of seeingyou messing with it. A new onemuch better looking would cost onlya couple of dollars I believe you in-,sist upon trimming such things yourself.' "Correct! Every way," Jean answered impassively. "I am not in lovewith my hat-making nor even withmy own way of trimming. Maybe Imight be if ""If what?" Wingfield asked almostsavagely as she paused.She smiled at him rather a hardsmile but wistful. "I was about tosay if I could buy the things I likerather than the things I can afford,"she said."You mean those poodle-dog feathers that fly in the face of everybody?"Wingfield queried.She shook her head, saying, "No .praise be. Willow plumes don't temptme in the least. But I would likesay for this summer a real fine strawthe seven-dollar sort, as pliable ascloth almost and very rich broad palepurple velvet for a bow and a trail oforchilds. I say just the thing yesterday for seventeen dollars and aParis tip, inside the crown to makebelieve it came from there.""Go get it!" Wingfield ordered, pulling a roll of bills from his pocket andtossing them to her.She did not touch the money. Shelooked at him steadily, smiling stillthat old smile. "I have never yet putthe rent into finery," she said, dropping her eyes.Wingfield scowled. "I am beginning to believe it might better for usif you did," he said. "You're not a bitbad-looking but nobody wants adowdy anywhere. That's how you'releft out of things. I have to go it ispart of the game to be seen rightand things are slow enough as it is.""I have not complained," Jean saidcalmly. "It Is not very exhilaratingeating bread and cheese in the kitchen alone, when you are with' yourfriends. Still, somehow I would rather stick to the bread and cheese. Theydo not bore me not anything like thegang which haunts those table d'hoteplaces."Jean has risen, hat in hand. Sheturned to the mirror and set it uponher head, speculation in her eyes, astronger frown underneath the brim."It locks like a last year's birdnest," she commented, tossing it tothe ceiling and catching it askew."Nobody would believe I was once afielder, though a substitute," she saidwith a faint twinkle. "Do you remember the game Tim? Out in theback lot I was just thirteen andgawky as a young calf but I couldrun and had the only pair of reallegs left available.""I remember well," Tim nodded."That was a game sure. Accidentwas epidemic ten of our noble team,canned with sprained legs, arms,shoulders what hot But not a onecould have caught the fly you did itsaved the game for us. That remindsme I met Treptow last week and almost the first thing he said was:'Where is that sister of yours? Thegirl of the fly?' ""You didn't tell him of course,"Jean said quietly.Wingfield looked down. "You knowI can't tell people," he said almostfretfully, "if they knew I we kepthouse they'd expect O! hang it!You know why.""Perfectly," Jean said. "You areash-ined to seem joor you'd mindthat worse, much worse, than beingpoor. You like to be liberal mindI don't say extravagant. Since youearn most of the money, you have aright to spend it as you choose. Ihave never -complained I never shall.But this I ask if Billy Treptowcomes in your way again ask himhere to dinner.""Ask him! When he has all the richfolk running after him! Don't youknow that?" Wingfield demanded.Jean nodded, but persisted. "Askhim. I know he'll come if you tellhim I am to be cook."Somehow Wingfield did ask Billy.In fact, he could not very well escapeit, because Billy developed suddenly aturn of inquiry that quickly broughtout the facts. "Jean was in the citykeeping house for her brother Billystraightway demanded the address.Wingfield went home laggardly. Itwas late when he got there too latefor' anything but a nurried change ofcostume. It took him all aback to findthe living rpom deserted, the diningroom, a tiny place, likewise emptyexcept for massed roses. He wondered if, after all, Billy Treptow wasnot coming. It was five minutes pastthe hour. Suddenly from the kitchenhe heard voices and laughter.Pushing into the door there wasnot room to go clean inside he sawBilly with both arms about Jean,whost hands upheld a platter of delectable fried chicken. She waslaughing and saying: "Mind! You'llupset your dinner," to which he wasanswering, "Not on your life. I've"been waiting five -years to eat yourcooking now I mean to eat it always." '...- ;.x. .-. .JSpirit Apportd to Jlrothtr.In recent years no African explorerhaa gripped the popular .imaginaticmmore than the Ill-fated Capt, BoydAlexander, who was done to death in agallant effort to. induce certain nativetribes to live at peace with each other.The, story of bis last expedition to theDark Continent has been published.The book contains the explorer's diaryof the expedition, this, curiouslyenough, being the only diary he everkept, having been accustomed on former occasions to trust to his carefully drawn maps, and his retentive memory. The book has been edited by theexplorer's brother, Mr. Herbert Alexander, who relates a strange dream,which should be of interest to studentsof the occult. "I saw Boyd he says,"illumined from the darkness of night,standing up, surrounded by angry natives, who were armed. He ivas tryingto speak to me, but I did not hear hisvoice, rather it. was as if the whole airwas echoing, 'I. am in their power.'Then suddenly he was swallowed upin darkness."os "With Modern Methods.The elder sighed. "Well, brother,"he said to the white-chokered stranger, "I wish you joy of your lease.The old building has been a hoodooever since I can remember. We neverhad a pastor who could half fill it."The white chokered stranger nodded."I'll be turning em away inside of amonth," he cheerfully said. The elderstared. "And may I ask to what denomination you belong?" "I belongto the film denomination," replied thestranger, briskly. "Four moving pictures at every performance, with acomplete change three times a weekand all for the small sum- of fivecents!" And he turned away to directthe placing of the ticket pagoda andthe automatic piano.Whaling Curiosity.A whale without an ounce of oil inits carcass is surely a curiosity. Thecrew of the New Zealand Whalingcompany's Bakiura relate that a whale80 feet long, rather bedraggled looking, but of fair size, was brought inby one of the company's vessels toRussell to be boiled down. The customary cutting-up process was gonethrough and the parts put into theboilers. But not an ounce of oil couldbe obtained, and it turned out that thewhale had marks on it which suggested that it had been shot on a previousoccasion, and that it was suffering asa result from some form of blood-poisoning,which rendered its flesh andfat useless.No Wonder."I've found a new use for thosegramophone records you bought lastweek and which cost such a lot ofmoney," said his wife, according to theSan Francisco Chronicle. "How cleveryou are," he exclaimed. "What isyour latest?" "In the first place," shebegan, "I" hold a skein of wool overmy arm, tie one end of the wool on areel, place the reel on the gramophoneand then start the machine. The woolIs wound up in no time!" The fondhusband gasped in admiration. "Butthat's not all," she continued. "Tomorrow I shall place a little bath brickon one end of the records, start thegramophone and so clean the knives."He is still gasping.Creation of New Worlds.People ask "How was the universecreated?" The fact is . the universewas never "created." It is in a process of perpetual creation. It is being made, destroyed and remade allthe time. The telescope and the spectroscope bring down to us pictures ofparts of it in all the stages of growthand decay. The most fascinatingproblem of modern astronomers is thesearching out of that great process;the discovery of the method of theworld machine. It is a question notof what happened once in ages ago,but of what is all the time happening.World's Work.Cable and Wireless.An announcement recently made bythe directors of an ocean cable company once more emphasizes the factthat no detrimental effect whateverhas been experienced by the rapid expansion of wireless telegraph communication. Just as in the familiar caseof a new rapid transit system in alarge 'city finding its own new business without taking from the traffioon existing means of transportation,so the cable companies are .findingthat there is ample room for both, theold and the new systems-In the increasing demand for transoceanic telegraphy. Apples for Health.The old Idea that apples were thefavorite fruit of the god is a "plausibletheory. The freshness of youth wasever possessed by those who made apples their principal diet. Certain it isthat there is no food so valuable. Apples nourish the brain and spinal cord.They contain phosphorous, albumen,sugar, gum, chlorophyll, malic acid,gallic acid, vegetable fiber and water.They cure gout and rheumatic disorder and exercise a beneficent influence on the liver and stomach Ripeapples and bread as a diet will domore to restore health than drugs.Americans Were "Bostoneses."During the Revolutionary war andshortly after it, citizens of the UnitedStates were known in the Spanish colonies as "Bostoneses," probably because the war began near that town.JTrancisco Cruzat, Spanish lieutenantgovernor of Missouri, writing to thegovernor of Louisiana on December 8,1777, saidr "Colonists in the Englishrterritofles are being .forced to beararms against the BoBtohesejB.-" - -every day.

Halfe's masterpiece will be Dresentedjn a lavishstage environment that is'said to rivalany of the many productions given tothis opera in its seventy years of popularity. The magnificence of theAborn version combined with hewealth of detail ne'er before attempted have caused many to wonder how itwas ever possible tojiave given a completely satisfying performance of thisgrand old opera without the introduction of at least some of the ideas thathaveAnow been incorporated. , To theopera has been given a scenic mounting comprised of. six massive andmagnificent scenes, and in this particular, widely different from the makeshift scenery that has usually beenemDloyedby traveling comDanies Dresenting Balfe's work. Among "thefeatures heretofore not known to thisopera are a cavalcade or norses thatare shown in a wild race up the mountains in pursuit of the kidnapping gypsy chief, an encampment of Gpysieswho are seen making and breakingcamp, with its genuine gypsies, .dogs!geese, pigs, chickens, etc. These anda multitude of otner novelties combine to make the Aborn version of"The Bohemian Girl" an offering ofexceptional importance. The presenting company, one of importance andunusual size, includes a double cast ofprincipals, big chorus and a special orchestra. The most important of those cornpricing the cast are Helena Morrill, aprima donna discovery made by theAborns during their Boston engagement last spring.Blanche Rio it Ltxinf ton.Stamped with the approval of NwYork, Chicago, and the larger cilieof the country, "The Wall Strett Girl"is again Blanche Ring's starring vehicle this season, and this popularcomedienne will be seen in this greatest of her. successes at the LexingtonOpera House Monday, February 10.When it comes to singing songs,there is only one Blanche Ring. la"The Wall Street Girl" there arefully a dozen tuneful numbers and halfof them fall to Miss Ring; among -thembeing "Deedle Dum Dee." "IWant a Regular Man," "I Should HaveBeen Born alBoy," and'Whistle It."Miss Ring has surrounded herself witha chorus of stunning girls, who assistmaterially in making the songs worthwhile.Margaret Mayo and Edgar Selwynare the co-authors of "The Wall StreetGirl," while Hapgood Burt i responsible for the lyrics. The music is bythe late Karl Hoschna and variousothers. The piece is in three acts-andirrespective of the music and songswould make an interesting play.James Greene, a Wajl street broker,disappointed in not" having a son.brings uphis daughter, Jemima, in amannish fashion. Her interest centers in a business career until shemeets Dexter Barton from Nevada.Then she throws her masculine training to the winds and adonts all tha -fluffsand flounces so dear to the heartsof most women.Barton has a gold mining pronositionto sell arid when this is turned downby Greene, Jemima takes a hand andbays a half interest. How the goldmine saves Greene from financial failure and how Jemima falls in love withher mining partner are cleverly workedout by the cu-authors.Featured with Miss Ring is WillRogers, whose lariat throwing andqu?ir.t humor touched New York andChicago's funny bone.
