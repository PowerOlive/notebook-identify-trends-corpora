High temperature- during most of
the .week fastened the maturity of
late tobacco, and corn; but caused
such rapid drying of the soil that
there was lfttle improvement in con
dition. Cutting of both crops pro
ceeded rapidly. Most tobacco in
the sJQulhern-counties has been cut,
but considerable burWy is still in
the field. The long period of dry,
warm .weather has caused the first
cutting f vtobacco to cure rapidly,
with a good ' color, - and without
damage from sweating. Some of It
is" about ready to strip. Early
corn in the shock is well dried out,
and some" is Hry enough to crib.
The week4 was too hot and dry for
late potatoes, which range in .con
dition from poor to fair in most lo
calities. In most of the crop the
plants are still green,-but are small
and are not doing well. Some of
the earliest planting are' being dug,
with light yields. The weather
was favorable for completing the
harvest of cowpea and alfalfa hay,
and for filling silos. The few scat
tered showers reached only a small
area,, and plowing is being seri
ously delayed by dry soil. - What-
seeding has been done, mostly of
cover crops, has been accomplished
under unsatisfactory conditions as
to .drilling, and germination. But
little wheat has been sown. .East
ures continue poor in most locali
ties, having lost most that was
gained ffom tlie last rains. Except
plowing and seeding, which await
rain, farm work is well advanced.
Conditions were,favprable for gath
ering and marketing fruit
Mrs. Sarah Pitcock, 84, of Glas
gow, Ky., saw a railway train for
the first time in her life when
brought from her home in Monroe
county, where she had always re
sided, to the depot at Glasgow. She
regarded the locomotive as the
greatest 'wonder she had ever seen,
but said that she would finish out
her life without ever riding on ta
train. She is an invalid and has to
be carried where she goes.
D0N"T BURN LEAVES
Burning leavejfaK tjiis time of the
year is said to cause diphtheria:
Citizens shouldV take every precau
tion 'to prevent such a malady get
ting a foothold here. There is a
city ordinance forbidding . burning
of leaves, and providing a penalty
for same. Don't burn 'the leaves.
Use them for fertilizer.
PROTECT THE BIRDS
There are more quail ""in this
county this fall than f or many
years, and they should be protected
until they become" numerous
enough to justify killing a few. Es
pecially . should the professional
hunters be kept out. We hope that
the various game reserves will see
to it-that the birds have protection

Chandler, of Atlanta, found the
grave of Captain Jack C. Curtwright
on the Perryville battle field, had
the remains disinterred and shipped

Captain Curtwright was the father

servant had buried his body where
he fell on a battlefield in Kentucky.
Various cemeteries had been visited

While Bourbon countyJs corn
crop is' said to be below the aver
age and the hay' crop is not quite
equal to last year's yield, the to
bacco crop will be a full average,
and perhaps the best raised in the
county in recent years. The greater
part has been cut and housed, and
having been planted early is fully
manured. Competent judges who
have been over the county during
the past, few days state openly and
without reservation that Bourbon'
county growers have most excellent
crops' of tobacco.
This is taken to mean the best
.thing in the world, "Join
