RELIC OF PAST AGE
A Century Old Newspaper That la R
inarlcably Well Preserved
Ir Glenn Brown the architect has
Mnteresting relic in the shape of an
old newspaper probably one of the old
est publications to be found in this
eountry It is The Virginia Gazette
and Alexandria Advertiser published
in Alexandria The copy is dated Thurs
day April 25 1793 The motto of the
paper which is printed under the title
isrHs follows
O thou by whose almighty nod tho scale
Of empires rises or alternate falls
fiend forth tho saving virtues round this landl
There is no mention made of the
names of tho publishers or editors but
an advertisement which is inserted
asks for rags old seines fishing nets
and the like to be brought to the office
eo that paper can be made from it
From this it would seem that the firm1
manufactured its own paper
In the news columns which form but a
email portion of the paper the adver
tisements covering a greater part is a
dispatch dated London Feb 25 pre
vious giving an account of an insurrec
tion in Ireland There are also publish
ed Paine a reasons for preserving tho
life of Louis Capet The plan of the
new French constitution is given and
a number of dispatches from Paris ap
pear
One of the most interesting advertise
ments in the paper is that of a lottery
It states that it will be given by the
commissioner appointed to prepare the
public buildings etc within the city
of Washington for the reception of con
gress and for their permanent residence
after tho year 1800 Samuel Blodgett
was the agent for the affair in this city
The capital prize was a hotel with all
furnishings valued at 50000 There
were cash prizes of 25000 the whole
amounting to 350000 The lottery
by the way was never held as much
opposition was dove loped against it
Samuel Blodgett was the one whose
heirs claimed a large portion of the na
tional capital
There are several advertisements for
runaway slaves offering rewards of
from G to 10 There is an offer of a
reward of 40 which would seem large
compared with those offered for the
runaway slaves for eight bushels of
clover seed stolen from Mount Vernon
The advertisement goes on to state that
the clover seed was stolen from the
granary and is supposed to have been
taken by negroes It is signed by An
thony Whiting who was Washingtons
overseer
There is an advertisement in the pa
per of the celebrated horse Eclipse from
which many of the thoroughbred horses
of the present day have descended
There is also an advertisement of the
opening of the city tavern at the sign
of the Bunch of Grapes by John
Wise The statement is made that
northern and southern mails will arrive
at the office until Nov 1 on Mondays
Wednesdays and Fridays at 6 p m
On one of the pages is a song com
posed for Lodge No 10 of Charles
town commonly called Portobacco
The paper consists of four pages of
four columns each The size of the
sheets is about 12 by 18 inches The
paper wTas published Thursdays ef each
week The ss were all like f 5s The
- paper has been remarkably well pre
served Washington Star
Miracles and Dilettantelsm
He Pugin visited Sant Andrea
della Fratte the scene of the miracu
lous conversion of Abbe Ratisbonne the
Jew Abbe Ratisbonne entered the
church a Jew and came out a Christian
having seen there he stated a vision of
our Lady The story Pugin said after
seeing the church is demonstrably
false The man could not have said a
prayer in such a hideous church Our
Lady could not have chosen such a
church for a vision The man could
have had no piety in him to have staid
in such a church at all
The friend to whom his remarks
were addressed replied As I heard the
story Ratisbonne was not at the mo
ment praying but thinking of the un
ceuthness of the architecture of the
place Pugins whole face changed Is
that so Then he was a man of God He
knew what true Christianity was
though he was a Jew I honor him
Our Lad would have come to him any
where The story is demonstrably

Duck Ejrcs In an Albumen Factory
Near Chingkiang China is a great
albumen factory for the utilization of
the duck eggs which are produced in
that region in enormous quantities
flocks of 4000 and 5000 ducks being
by no means uncommon The eggs are
broken at the rate of from 40000 to
60000 per day by women who separate
tho white from the yolk the former be
ing carefully cleaned and dried until
they resemble fish glue when they are
packed in 400 pound cases lined with
zinc The yolks are passed through
eieves into 25 gallon receptacles mixed
with a salt and borax solution packed
in 500 pound barrels and used in Europe
for preparing and dressing articles of
euperior quality The albumen finds a
ready market in England France and
Germany for dyes for the best cotton
