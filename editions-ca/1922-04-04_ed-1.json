Encouraged by the remarkable re

local merchants are- planning to
hold a spring style show, to be
staged in a few weeks. The details
are under discussion by a committee

musical revue, "Fads and Fancies"
o"f 1922," on the nights of April 5

style show, fully equal .in 'all re
spects to that held here last year.

already foreshadowed by the pre
diction of a large Democratic dele
gation from Pennsylvania in the
next Congress and a good chance to
redeem the State from Republiean
misrule by the election of the Dem

seconded by the leading Democratic

men and women of each element fn

Idell Hull, .Chairman of the Demo

"The Pennsylvania Democrats
now have set the pace. Their splen

for the sake of party unity and of
early party activities preparatory to
the coming elections will hearten
and inspire Democrats

APRIL COURT DAY
Although there was a large crowd
in Paris yesterday, the volume of
business transacted for April Cojurt
Day was not up to the average of
former years. A number of mules !
and horses changed ownership at
fair prices. The usual number of
"scrubs" held sway with the horse
traders, who realized small profits in
the way of trades. Several automo
biles were disposed of at public sale
at prices considerably lower than
those quoted at the garages. Mer
chants report their business as be,
ing fairly good,' and collectioris
good. The tobacco markets drawing
to a close and the farmers being
busy witlT their spring work, con
tributed to keep many away fromi
town.
