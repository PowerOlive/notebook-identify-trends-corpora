"THE KISS BURGL4R" AT LEX
INGTON OPERA HOUSE
The principal attraction at the
Lexington Opera House this week
will be "The Kiss Burglar,", which
comes on Friday and Saturday even
ings, with Saturday matinee. This
is the season's musical comedv suc
cess, coming direct from the George
M. Cohan Theatre, after a successful
run in New York and other Eastern
cities.
Those who have been seeking
something new in musical comedy
will find it in Coutt's and Tennis
Smacking Musical cedy success,
"The Kiss Burglar' which cqmes
fresh from its Broadway run of sfx
solid months at the George M. Cohaa
Theatre, New York City. It con
tains novelty in incident and action
and animated movement, pretty
music, graceful dancing and charm
ing acting. -Glenn MacDonough
wrote the book and lyrics and no
doubt has more successes to his
credit than any other libertest of
the day, which embrace "The Al
gerian," the novelty musical comedy
in which Marie Tempest met with
her biggest success. "Babes An Toy
land," "It Happened In Nordland,"
"The Midnight Sons," "Queen of the
Movies," "Fades and Fancies." but in
the work of his latest success, "The
Kiss Burglar," he has surpassed him
sely. Raymond Hubbeir composed
the music and he knows what the
American public likes. There are no
melodic eccentricities, such asF we'
have found within the last two
years in some of the foreign operet
tas, but attractive and beautiful
airs, easily caught and remembered,
and that will soon be picked up and
carried everywhere.
