Individual May Take Over Club.
The possibility of base ball in Paris
during the coming season zests entirely
with one man and unless a franchise is
granted Covirfgton and Newport to en
ter the Blue Grass League there is a
big chance that Pans will turn over
her franchise before the.season tooens.
This decision was reached Friday
after a meeting had been called bv
President J. W. Bacon, of the Paris
club, but from the failure of a suffi
cient number of directors of the club
to put in their appearance the meet
ing was called off. Those who at
tended, however, discussed the condi
tions which now confront the club a'nd
it was practically decided that unless
funds could be raised with which to
meet the expense incurred during the
training season the players no-ar under
contract would be released and the
franchise thrown uu.
William Shire, secretary ot'the Paris
Club, who has been one of the most
enthusiastic officials of the club since
base ball was inducted in this city
four years ago, and who is extremely
poDular all over the league circuit, is
considering a proposition to take over
all the stock of the club, assume all of
its liabilities and give Paris a good
club during thecsmiug season provided
he can enlist the support of some good
i man to look after its affairs. To de
vote his entire time to it would be im-
J poFsible and woukl interfere with his
! business interests in this ciiy.
I A number of the stockholders in the
local club have signified their willing
ness to turn over their stock to Mr.
Shire in event that he should report
i favorablyon the proposition. Others
J will likely follow their example.
Mr. Shire ia'of the opinion that if
j teairs are placed in botn Covington
'and Newport it will serve vto promote
interest in the clubs already compos
ing the league and js awaiting the de
cisionof the Federal Court at Coving
j ton upon the suit instituted by Senator
L. W. Arnett. President Thomas Rus
Usell, of the Blue Grass League and
others against President Herrmann, of
the Cincinnati club, tor temporary in
junction against the five mile clause of
"the National agreement.
It is the belief that if the court
J grants the injunction Mr. Shire will
, readilv assume the control of theParis
j club and he is figured as the'best man
in mis city 10 conauct us aiiairs unuer
the present existing conditions. ;
Already signed contracts have been
received from a numner of players
j and others are expected. In justice to
these it was deemed advisable to take
early action, and if it became appar
ent that to launch the team was an im
possibility, it vould give the players
I an opportunity to secure other derths.
I With Mr. Shire at the head ot the
j club, and with a united support of
j Paris fans when the season t opens, the
team should be sell sustaining through
out the season.

Better Babies.
"Each year we raise better cattle,
better corn, better fruit, better flowers
why not better babies." '
This is the title of a very interesting
article in the March number of the
Woman's Home Companion about the
Babies' Health Campaign, carried on
in Iowa. 'Ihe movement was started
by Mrs. Marv T. Watts, a member of
the Iowa Cnngress of Mothers, and
Dr. Margaret V. Claik, a practicing
physician.
Instead of delivering lectures to ;n-'
! different audiences, hey put fifty Iowa
babies on exhibition at the State Fai
alongside of the cattle and corn, and"
with the same sore of scientific scor-,
ing. And the lowans dic?overed that
their babies were rot ud to the stan-
j dard of the cattle and corn.
! 1 his aroused a storm of disaDUoint-
ment and disapproval, but at the saaae
time it touched their pride. And the"
mothers of the Stale began to study
hygiene and to correct the defects f
their babies' diet and training.
In the second contest about five
times as many children were entered,
resulting in in much higher scores, foe
the contestants than in the first shew.
One little girl, who had lost out en
tirely in a previous contest, took a
first prize, her improvement being e
tirely due to the more scientific cara
which, she had received.
A circle of young mothers here are
interested in starting this movement
in Bourbon county, 'ihe directors aE
the County Fair have readily agreed iS
substitute a contest of this kind for
the customary beauty show. And ft
will certainly be a big feature of the
fair thislall, 5 one that will interest
the club women all over the State.
We believe that thi3 is a work of
national importance and ,that it oogh
to receive the serious attention aife
encouragement of 'all puhlic spirited
citizens. And who can predict tfo
good it may accomplish?
This dozen yoang mothers wish t
organize a Babies' Health League and
ask all who are interested to maet at
the alks Building Thursday at 2:30 p.
m. for this purpose. This should an
neal to a great many people besides
the mothers themselves as an oppor-"
tunity to do a patriotic service.
