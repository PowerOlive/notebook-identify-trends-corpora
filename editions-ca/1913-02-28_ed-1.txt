The theory of suicide is offset by the fact that her sis'ter wah in the room until five minutesbefore her death. She had asked foran apple and was eating it while hersihter was preparing to retire. MissPenelope Jameson left the room andwas gone about five minutes and returning found her lister dead.The coroner's investigation failed toreveal sufficient cause for the deathand portions of the stomach were removed and will be submitted to achemist for analysis. The powder Itouiid in the room will also he analyzed. " -ftjiss Jameson left Paris about twomonths ago. She was a great suffererfrom headaches and had made frequent trips to eminent specialistswith the hope of gaining relief butwithout result. About a vear ago shemade a trip to Seattle, Wash., whereshe was under the care of a distinguished specialistybut who failed togive relief.Last December Miss Jameson wentto Cincinnatiwhere she underwent anoperation, and was thought to be onthe road to recovery although thephysician did not expect relief for herailment immediately. She was stillunder the care of the physician, whohad been called only the day beforeHer family had expected her to returnhome next week.At times, it is said, ,when she suffered intensely from the headaches,she seemed very despondent and wouldfrequently say she wished "she weredead.Following the investigation conducted by the coroner, the body wasturned ever to Dr. J.

Tom Stuart, of Winchester, waapresent to look after the interests ofthe Central Kentucky Natural GasCompany, of which he is a representative. The sale of the franchise was opposed by Mr. Walker after it had beendiscovered upon the reading of theminutes that the ordinance for the saleof the franchise had not been passedby thp Board, the orrFy action takenby that body beinal; the last meetingwhen the City Attorney, Mayor andLight Committee were instructed toconfer in regard to the proposedchanges in regard to rates, etc." Theordinance was uublished by order oftfie Mayor, against whom Mr. Walkertook issue, and presenting the legalside of the question finally succeededin having the order set aside.Atthe close of a heated discussionthe ordinance was again read, andpassed, with an additional clause providing that purchaser not be allowedto tear up the cilv's streets for thepurpose of laying maina until the pipelines were within two miles of thecity limits. To this clause Col. Stuartohjected upon the ground that no "further evidence ot good faith other thanthat specified in the franchisecould beshown, and unless the franchise offeredwithout the addition was passed itwould not be acceptable. As a rearesentative of the company he said hewould consider the doors of Parislocked up on the proposition.The ordinance, however, was passedbut by a unanimous vote was later rejected.i Probably it will be framed andpassed without any"technical flaws atthe next meeting.

WhileMrs. Ed R. Wilson, of Shelbvyille,Ky.. doesn't sell Studebaker cars asdoes Mrs. King out in Kansas.her husband does, and she herself has won theunique distinction of being the firstwoman driver in Kentuckv, the onewho has accumulated the greatestmileage, and the one who has drivenfartherest accompanied by hr womanfriends only. ,Mrs. Wilson rceently piloted her car,a 1912 model "Thirty," on a trip thattook in Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, Albany, Naw York City, Philadelphia, Washington and Wheeling,the circuit beginning and ending atSnelbyville. Her skill as a driver isvouched for by the fact that the tripcontained but two involuntary stoDs,both the result o punctures. itMiss Ford Returns SaSely FromMexico.Miss Sue Ford, a missionary representing the Missionary Board of theMethodist church, who has been stationed at Durango.Mexico, has returned to her home in this city after having been notified by the American consul that the safety of Americans couldnot be'guaranteed.Miss Ford gives a graphic account ofthe situation in Mexico and the chaoticconditions following the overthrowingof the Madero administration, and theascendancy of Huerta and Diaz to thehead ot the provisional Government."The prospects .for peae. from myobservations," says Miss Ford, "areanything but promising under thepresent administration Many of thestates are in an uproarious rebelliondespite the newspaper reports to thecontrary. The lives of Americans areheld very cheaply and those who cando so are fleeing the country."According to Miss Ford the troopstrom the town where she was stationed were removed at the., outbreak ofhostilities in the Mexican capital following the release of Diaz from prison, and the populace of the city wereafforded no protectiori from the bandsof brigands that aripermitted to goover the country pillaging and murdering, without any attempt on tne partof the Government to check the atrocities. .Murdering bands of Mexicans infestthe country surrounding the townwhere she was located, and visitingevery city extract monev and provisions from foreign residents as well asthe natives. Not only has the government failed to protect Americans butin most instance? they have been denied the privilege of protecting themselves and all nf the American menhave been relieved of arms.As a consequence Americans areleaving the country as rapidly as possible, but great difficulty is being experienced owing to the fact that travel is very dangerous. Many of therefugees trom the interior are makingtheir way to the seacoast towns withthe view of embarking by steamshipfor America.Friends and relatives of Mrs. Fordin this city were very apprehensive asto her safety as she was located in theheart of one of the rebellious districtsCommunications from her were veryinfrequent and this fact ssrved to increase the anxiety of her relativeshee. She left her post at the order ofthe Kentuckv Conference after theconditions in Mexico had been laid before it andwhen the American,Consulfailed to promise protection for Americans.

MOORE,Custodian.LOANSHER COLLEGE CAREERBy HELEN DEAN.It was something unusual in our village for a girl to have aspirations fora college career, and then, too, that itshould be Joe Miller's plain, frecklefaced little Maggie, who had graduated from high school with honors,but no flowers. Indeed, flowers hadnot entered largely into Maggie's life.After her mother's death she kepthouse for her crippled father untilhe died.If Maggie heard how she was criticised for thinking of spending her little inheritance so foolishly, she didnot let it affect her. She went tocollege, and we did not see anythingof her for four years. When she cameback, we scarcely recognized Joe'sgirl in the tall, beautiful young ladywho was so kind and sweet to allof us, that we began to think collegemight be a pretty good thing for a girl,after all. But it was as we feared,Maggie Margaret, as she called herself had ideas; she couldn't settledown. ,Mrs. Stover said she came to herhouse one evening and told her thatshe was interested in domestic science, and that after having given theservant-girl problem much study, shehad come to the conclusion that ifgood, capable girls would take up thework, the standard would be raisedand this noble profession lifted fromthe depths to which it had fallen. Shethen asked Mrs. Stover point blankwhether she would let her daughtersgo out with her to service. Mrs.Stover has a weak heart, and she hada spell right there.Maggie was not easily discouraged.She visited all her girl friends, butnot one was sufficiently interested inthe good work to sacrifice preconceived ideas. Mrs. Ivan, however, saidthat she had presented the matter toher in such an attractive light thatshe really thought of encouraging herAnna Belle, but, as she argued, itmight ruin her future prospects ayoung man fraom Spring Dale wascalling at the Ivan home and thatJoe Miller's Maggie had nothing tolose in that way. We really feltsorry for Maggie. If she had stayedat home, she might have eventuallymarried some plain, honest man, butnow, we agreed, she was matrimonially dead. No man would stand fora woman with queer ideas.Maggie succeeded in getting a position as cook with the Van Skiver'sdown on the River road. We heardthrough their nurse that when theeldest son came home for vacation hespent too much time in the kitchen tosuit his mother, so she told her cookshe didn't need her services longer.She went to the city in the fall andsecured employment with a collegeprofessor's family. We heard nothingof her for about two years, then Littleton had a sensation. A markedcopy of a city paper was sent on.Van Huett-MIIIer."Rather a unique wedding took placeon the 30th, at Hall Crest, the summerhome of Prof. Andrew Arlington. MissMargaret Miller and Dr. Henry VanHuett were united in marriage."Mrs. Van Huett is interested in social work, and was employed as a domestice in the Arlington home, wheremestic in the Arlington home, wheremarriage ceremony took place in thekitchen, according to the wishes ofthe bride."Doctor and Mrs. Van Huett willleave for an extended trip abroad."Putting It Delicately.He was a stage aspirant, and hadcontrived somehow to gain an introduction to a well known manager,who agreed to fix a date for a trial.This duly came off, and expectantlythe aspirant awaited the verdict."What do you think of it?" he asked,after a deep silenee. "Well," the manager replied slowly, "all I can say isthat if ever you are put in prison foracting it will be a grave miscarriageof justice."Handsome Industrial EditionThe Mt.

""?THEATRICAL."THE TRAIL OP THE LONESOMEPINE."A beautiful stage story of Drimitivelove that is most appealing enhancedby a wpalth of scpnic embellishment,"The Trail of .the Lonesome Pine," enables you to see things as they areamong a people bred and born withinthe fastnesses of the Kentucky lulls.When most men are in love they invariably wear their hearts on theirsleeves and feel eatrer to have thewoman they love see how it throbs forthem. Not so with Jack Hale, in Eucene Walter's dramatization of JohnFox, Jr.'s story of "The Trail of the?.'.,.?.June'June," the Primitive Mountain Girl,in "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine,"which Comes to the Paris Grand,Wednesday, March 5th.Lonesome Pine." Hale represses hislove for June, the primitive moonshiner's daughter, and permits her toreveal slowly the wealth of her owngreat affection, simply but with greatsweetness and frankness.It isa play of the heart, far reaching and outstanding beyond any otherj known, stage love story, for each charjacter, each scene grips with such viselike intensity that the lonesome pinebecomes indeed the mecca for all whowould know what it means to Jove andbe loved.SOTHERN AND MARLOWE ATLEXINGTON.E.
