A prominentreal estate agent of Paris (ofcourse,they are all prominent) stated theother day that it was almost impossible to spend much time about thebusiness part of Paris without beingasked by some stranger, or even bysome Paris resident regarding housing accommodations.It is a fact, he said further, thatthere is an unprecedented demandfor -houses in Paris, and that if theic-were one hundred houses built herein one day, they would all be takenin the srme length ot time, and oc-euied within a week. The city israpidly being transformed. Manyof the old landmarks are being razedto make room, for more modernbuildings, and in the meantimelhere seems to be a steady inflowof new residents, while very feware moving away. "You just can'tget around it," said Mr. Real Es-jtate Man, "room must be made fort-hese people in seme way, if they intend to become permanent residentsof Paris. as seems to be their intention, so far as I can learn fromtalkes with them. There is someidle capital here surely, that couldbe profitably invested in smallhouses. This kind of investmentwould bring in a nice per cent, tothe promotors. and help to solve thehousing problem that has become s&perplexing in Paris."HERE'S YOUR - CHANCE CITYx-n.trx-.Dxvx x iix .o.uvxxu.uiA one-story, 6-room residence, ofG rooms, bath, 2 porches, gas anaelectric lights, cistern and cellar.Beautiful lawn, trees, shrubs, etc.A modern city home.

The fuse in your line on the "main frame" mayblow out then your telephone is "dead." -Switchboard cords are small flexible cables of many ,tiny wires; several of the little wires frequently snap fromconstant handling, then your connection "cuts off."The apparatus is sensitive to extremes of heat or cold,dust or moisture. It is constantly watched and tested, butno precaution can eliminate all the trouble-these are justa few samples of the things that happen. .Considering all the electrical apparatus and connectionsinvolved in a telephone call, it is not surprising that thingsoccasionally go wrong!"At Your Service" 'Paris Home Telephone and Tdcer ann Co., , Yeatch, Dis, SSSTl Cannon, Loca! ,UjTit?iirfi ?" -!229 Z7"Aosurdly" higher prices fornewsprint paper bought on thespot market are due to a "corner"resulting naturally from the presentshortage, George McAneny, executive manager of the New YorkTimes, declared before the Senatecommittee investigating the, papersituation. The market is two orthiee times as much as that forpaper bought under contracts, hesaid.Brokers and small manufacturerwere blamed by McAneny for thehigh prices.

Tajrlor, 310 Twenty-first stieet, Huntington, w. Va., while telling of herwonderful recovery to a special Tanlac representative who had heardof her remarkable case and had called to asceitain the facts."During the past year I have suffered more than words can expiessand I just hate to think of the terrible condition I was in," she continued. "I was so bad off I spentmuch of my time in bed and whenI did manage to be up it was aneffort for me to get around at all.My digestion was so extremelypoor that I was almost afiaid totouch a bite and when I did eat anything it was through force. I suffered untold agonies after eatingand I felt so nauseated . I couldhardly breathe. t Nervous spells often came on me and I couldn't sitstill one minute and I lost so muchsleep I was on the verge of a complete breakdown. I tried so muchmedicines without getting relief thatI almost gave up hope and myfriends and neighbors said if something wasn't done right away Iwould not last much longer."Finally, Gne of my friends whohad been taking Tanlac advised meto try it as it had done her so muchgood. Well, I took her advice andas long as I live I will bless the dayi began taking Tanlac for it is nothing short of remaikable how thismedicine has buiit me up from anervous wreck to a well and happywoman. My appetite is just fineand I can digest anything I eatwithout the slightest trouble at all.My nerves are just as steady as canbe and I am sleeping soundly everynight. I have new life and strengthand I will never be able to pay thedebt of gratitude I owe Tanlac for ithas been one of the gieatest blessings of my life."Tanlac is sold in Paris at thePeople Pharmacy.
