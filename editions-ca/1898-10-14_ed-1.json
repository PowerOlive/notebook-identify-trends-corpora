There are eggs and eggs The
egg
or yesterday looks feels measures and
weighs like the egg of last month but
theres a difference in another respect
and that difference is worth money
Its just so with laundry The difference
between good work and poor is slight to
the unpracticed discernment but its a
difference that counts every time Its
a difference that changes your laundry
bill from an expense to an investment
We do good work it will cost no more
than poor work but its worth double
the difference
