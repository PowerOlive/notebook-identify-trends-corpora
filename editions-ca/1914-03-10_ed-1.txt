Frank P. Webb, which occurred yesterday morning in hisroom at a boarding house in Knoxville, Tenn., and was the result of anattack of the heart, from which hehas been a long sufferer.The announcement of his deathcaused expressions of regret from allsides, so universal was the friendlyfeeling existing between he and somany citizens of this city, where hewas born and raised and where hehas spent the whole of his life.Capt. Webb passed through ParisWednesday night on his run betweenCincinnati and Knoxville and was inapparently good health, although hehas been a sufferer for a great whilewith heart trouble and has been inthe care of a physician for some time.His wife was with him Wednesdayarid spent the day with him in Cincinnati, returning to Paris Wednesdaynight, Mr. Webb continuing on his tripto Knoxville, where he arrived yesterday morning about ten o'clock. Hisrelative -here received only slight details of his death last night.It is said that Mr. Webb, upon arriving at Knoxville went to his room,previously leaving a call for thehour he was accustomed to arise, before going out on his run. It is supposed that he suffered a heart attacksome time during the morning fromthe effects of which he died and hiscondition was not discovered untilyesterday afternoon at about twoo'clock. His relatives here were immediately notified.Mr. Webb was one of the best'known and most popular conductorson the Kentucky Central Division ofthe Louisville & Nashville railroad.Not only was he popular with theofficials of the company and other employes, but was highly regarded bythe traveling public. He was held inthe highest esteem and regarded, asone of the most valued employes onthe road.Mrj Webb, who was about fifty-twoyears of age, was a son of the lateWilliam Webb and Mary C. Webb.He was born and raised in Paris,where he has always made his home.For a number of years he was thelocal agent of the Adams ExpressCompany, and later took a positionwith "the railroad company. Hispromotions came rapidly and whenthe through runs on this division ofthe road were established he waspromoted to the position he held atthe time of his death.About five years ago he was mared to Miss Cora Burns, of Nepton,Ky., who with one brother, Mr. Wm.H.

Stout presiding, the March term of the Bourbon Circuit Court convened yesterdaymorning. Indications are that theterm will be a very busy one, owingto the number of cases on boththe appearance and Commonwealthdockets.Commonwealth's Attorney VictorBradley arrived yesterday morning torepresent the Commonwealth. Afterhearing motions Judge Stout hadSheriff W. F. Talbott and his deputies, W. G. McClintock and O. L. Marshall, sworn, when the grand jun wasimpanelled as follows: Will Wilson,Sims Wilson, Jack Cunningham, W.S. Isgrigg, John Johnson, David Feld,Aylette Buckner, Walter Kenney,foreman, Maurice Willis, C. T. Wilson, Jeff Kiser, Homer Hutchison.Judge Stout delivered a lengthycharge to the grand jury in which hetouched upon all infractions of thelaw. He told of thirty felony cases,the record of the examining trials being turned over to the court officials,saying that this number of crimeshad been committed in this community in the past two and one-halfmonths and which was an unusuallylarge number for this county. Hesaid that the crimes were of almostevery conceivable nature and thatthey were due in most instances tothe practice of carrying concealedweapons. This he said was responsible for most of the crimes that hadbeen committed in this communitysince the last term of court.He urged the grand jury to investigate all cases of carrying concealedweapons that were brought to theirnotice, expressing the opinion thatshould this element of lawbreakersbe punished for such- infractionsthere would be less crime.He called attention to the liquorlaws and the practice of gaming, andurged the jury to investigate anyalleged infractions that might bebrought to their notice. The grandjury entered upon its deliberations,after being instructed by the court totake up the felony cases when thedefendants were confined in thecounty jail.Shortly before court was adjournedyesterday afternoon the news of thesudden death of Mr. Frank P. Webb,a brother of Circuit Clerk W. H.Webb, which occurred at Knoxville,was received, and this will necessitate his absence and former Clerk C.E. Butler will fill his position on theopening of court this morning.IfUres Plan In Senate to Fnr- MWnish Protection to Foreigners in MexicoVERGARA'S BODYIN AMERICAReported Invasion By Rangers Is Denied By Gov.ColquittWASHINGTON, March 9.

The necessary paperswere procured by Gibson Friday fromGovernor McCreary Friday and heleft immediately for Terre Haute.The prisoner is being held in thatcity pending a full identification and itis probable he will be returned heretomorrow.Morris was indicted at the lastterm of 'the? Bourbon Circuit Court ona charge of embezzlement, it being alleged that he appropriated to his ownuse the funds of the Metropolitan LifeInsurance Co., and is said to havebeen about one hundred dollars shortin his account.He moved with Jiis family from thiscity to Terre Haute" about six monthsago.anything so far this season, and thenrospects are that the house will becrowded for both performances.All over the city billboards andshow windows are displaying the coming of "Slumberland," a big banner isstretched across Main street with letters a yard in height proclaiming"Slumberland," and frames of photographs of the principal groups andprincipals of the play are being displayed on the principal streets, givingone an idea of the immensity of thiswonderful extravaganza.It is understood that the same production that has been playing in thelargest cities, where as high as $2.50has been charged for the best seatswill be given in its entirety here forthe 'price of ?1.00 for the highestpriced seats.

Thompson, precident ofBourbon College, will become the ladyprincipal of Hamilton College, andMiss Alice T. Katt, head of the Department of Mathematics in the Preparatory Department of HamiltonCollege, will take a position as instructor in Mathematics, succeedingMiss Caroline Berry, a sister of Mrs.F. P. Lowry, of this city, who has resigned from the position of lady principal and instructor in mathematics.The announcement of the consolidation of the two colleges was received with much surprise here, and thefact that Mrs. Thmpson will leave thecity has been the source of deep regret since it became known that thetwo schools would combine at thecoming of the session this fall,fall.Mrs. M. G. Thompson was reared inMercer county, and graduated fromDaughters College in 1882, when thatinstitution was in the prime of its usefulness. President John AugustusWilliams commenede her as the beststudent in English he had ever sentout from that institution. Later shereceived he degree of Bachelor of Literature from Bourbon College. Mrs.Thompson taught for six years in theChristian College, HustonvHIp, Ky.,and four years in the North Middletown College, occupying the positionof instructor in English and historyand lady principal in both institutions. For the past fourteen years shehas been the lady principal and president of Bourbon College, in this city.Since the deaht if her husband, Prof.M. G. Thompson, in July, 1913, shehas had entire charge of Bourbon College. Under her management the institution has grown to be one ofgrea influence, and is widely know asI one of the foremost colleges for women in the State. The people of Pansand vicinity will with reluctance yeldto the merging of that institution withHamilton College.The local insitution will close withthe end of the session this year, when.Mrs. Thompson will go to Lexingtonto assume the duties o'f her new position next fall. A large number ofthe students now enrolled in the Bourbon College will enter Hamilton Col-' leg next fall.yr 3& 5wmmmmmmmmmm mwsmmmmmWWwwt 9KLXiMiinnininiirmiiTLiiiuiiuiiiiinii ininiMiiiuifinnisinniiiinnuiriuKsniijnniHiiuMuniiiiiiiuiMnniiii rHF ar rtMiMJv a, ou. if-T .... flThe Store Where Reliability Reigns.

We, therefore,give some facts that cannot fail to beof public interest.From the first. date to the last,there was a progressive diminutionin the number of deaths from this disease. In 1884, there were 868 deathsretarned; in 1885, 857 deaths; in 188ff809' deaths, and so o, progressively,down to 433 deaths in 19T1 the lowest figures yet returned" in a singleyear."The mortality from tutiercviosisto each living 10,000 of the populationhas been reduced from 24".I0 to 10.01.The causes of this reductfon must beconceded to be largely educational.The first concerted effort to enlightenthe public as to the nature of tuberculosis was begun by the State Boardof Health immediately after its organizatfon in 1881,in the publication-of circulars and bulletins. From that !date to the present time, these havebeen xtensively circulated by theBoard. Tn addition there have bkerrpublic lectures under the auspices ofthe State Board of Health and variousvoluntary organizations. In thegreat educational work must be mentioned the New Hampshire Federationof "Woman's Clubs, tYie Woman'sChristian Temperance Union, the NewHampshire branch of the Red Cross,the New Hampshire State Grange,various charitable organizations, and'individuals personally interested inthe work.In a careful examination of the statistics of the disease, the evidencemust be conclusive, that the reductionin mortality has been secured almostwhollv through instructions in various directions from the sources- mentioned. In the more recent yearsshould be included the cures, arrestedcases, and direct fnstruction at sanatoria. "So far as the action of the Stateof New Hampshire is concerned, itmay be noted that the first legislativeaction apnlving in any sense to theconsideration of tuberculosis was theenactment whfrh created the StateLaboratory of Hyenie, and providedfor the bacteriological examination ofsputum from susocted cases, andfor the detection of possible meat in -fection."In 1905. a law was enacted prohibiting spitting on sidewalks and otherpublic places."In 1905, the New HamDshre StateSanatorium, for the treatment of tuberculosis cases, was created; also,an act was passed requiring that every death from pulmonary consumption, and every removal of a tuberculosis patient, should be reported tothe local Board of Health in orderthat the promises may be nrQnerlydisinfected."ELABORATE PLANSCompleted for Unveiling of.

Therewould be something doing among thecattle breeders and feeders. You couldsee the broad-backed roans and redsgrazing the field that God made sobeautiful for the thoroughbred andthe pure bred. It would be a visionto the farmer's son, and the youngfarmer who is thinking of leaving thefarm for the city would no longertire of farm life. Instead, there wouldbe a charm in his grazing herd; hewould see farming in a new light;the song of the birds would seemsweeter, and the grass would growgreener. The little brook with itsrumbling song would accord with thewhistle of the farmer's son.Good stock goes with good farming,Good farming means good citizens,stepping higher in every branch offarm life. What is a steer worth?That depends upon his breeding andthe kind of man that has charge ofhim. The steer feeds the rich andthe poor; he protects our feet, turnsthe wheels of the nation, bleacheswhite our fine sugars strained throughhis charred bones. He gives us buttons, beautiful hair-pins to adorn thehead, and his hair is used to beautifyour walls, fine soaps, glue, fertilizers,etc., are obtained from the steer. Hereturns fertility to the soil, gives tohis owner a good sum of money forhis care and feed. He gives employment to many thousand people. TheArmour Company employes over thirty-twothousand people in its plantand pays out $87,100,000 for cattleannually. The payroll of the companyamounts to nearly $26,000,000 a year.Its packing plants cover two hundredand eight acres of land and 2,100haorses and 500 cars are made use ofdaily. In supplying food, clothing,furnishings for the home, articles thatadorn, preparations that heal, prod-vucts that make for health, comfort,efficiency and economy all along theline extremely few are completewithout the nse of one of several articles of animal origin. Thus doesthis industry contribute to commerce,science and art.Oh! may the good days of the '80'sreturn to our bluegrass land, whenwe could count the Shorthorn herdsby the tens and twenties and sellthem from one to four, six and tenthousand a head. It was then thatthe champion steers of Chicago, St.Louis, Kansas City and New Orlenas,like Nunsuch and Schooler, were bredand developed in Kentucky, the grandest and most beautiful land in all theworld. Nunsuch won medals andcups and one thousand dollars in cash,for his owner, the late Mr. W. H.Renick. Several times, the championsteer of Chicago has sold for $1.50 perpound.Is he worthy a place in the showring? He would be a drawing cardfor the great army of cattle feeders.He would be a model, a type for theyoung farmer to build upon.The champion steer of Argentina in1913, sold for over $1,700. The champion Shorthorn sold for over $13,000.The champion Shorthorn of Englandin 1913 sold for $30,000..

Insome respects it is built on a largerscale than either of its predecessors,for it has twelve scenes where "TheGarden of Allah" had only eight.There are more than sixty speakingparts. Its success has been phenomenal. "Joseph and His Brethren" is a vitalized version of th story in thBook of Genesis written for the stageby Louis N. Parker. Mr. Parker vknown chiefly in America for his"Disraeli" and "Pomander Walk,'but in England he is known as the author of other successes, including"Drake," the hit of ftthe last Londonseason. "Drake" was given a spectacular production at His Majesty'sTheatre by Sir Herbert BeerbohmTree, who has also produced "Joseph"there this season.To present "Joseph and His Brethren" the Liebler Company has selected a cast of unusual ability. Brandon Tynan, who has been a star in hiown plavs and leading man for Nazimova, will play the role of -Joseph.James O'Neill, if "Monte Christo"fame, will have the part of Jacob, thepatriarch, and in the third act willplay Pharaoh. Pauline Fredericks,pronounced by artist Harrison Fisherthe most beautiful woman in America,and numerous other players of reputaton will be seen in the cast, while theheads of the technical departmentsof the Liebler Company who workedout the so-called "effects" in the playwill accompany the big production tothe Lexington Opera House.The company when traveling hasalmost the proportions of a circus,with its special train of fourteen carsfor the people, scenery and live stock.Among the latter are herds of camels,oxen, asses, horses and sheep.The four acts of "Joseph and HisBrethren" will be known as "TheCoat of Many Colors," "The Temptation," "The Dreams" and "The Deliverer." The scenes will be respectively: "The Tents of Shechem," "TheWells of-Dothan," "Jacob's Tent,""The Entrance to Jacob's House,""The Pyramids," and "In Joseph'sHouse."

Ofcourse, this has been an impossibilityand even if one could make it possible,there would be no time left for constructive work at home. To a certainextent the "County Life Conference"in Louisville, April 7, 8, 9, 10, willmake this a possibility without extensive traveling.Leaders in co-operative movementsfrom many parts of the South andfrom innumerable Northern States,have been engaged to tell just whatthey have accomplished and how itwas accomplished. They are to telltheir "ups" as well as their "downs,"in the cause of co-operation. Theywill also be on hand to show exactlyhow the work which has been a success at home can be transplanted toother neighborhoods. They will bringwith them not only the story, but alsoall of the material that is used in theirperfected organization to-day that itmay run smoothly.Enough enthusiasm is sure to be developed to mrke orga nizations amongthose present a certainty. This willbe done by these men in the most detailed way possible. The leaders whocome to the Conference should be ableto take the good word home in suchshape that it can be redeveloped andtake root.If you should wish to better yourown condition, or the condition ofyour state, or the condtiion of thewhole South, it would be well worthyour time and money to come to Louisville at this time.Even if you are not at all anxiousto hear any one of the speakers or seeany of the demonstrations, still itwould be a delight to be in a crowdof people who are enthusiastic enoughand devoted enough to come and rubelbows with other leaders. After all,there is nothing much better in lifethan the glow -which comes to all ofus when we come in contact with "livewires" from scattered places over thewhole country.If you are a leader or feel that youmight be a leader or hope to be aleader, make your plans at once andget the dust off your grip sack thatyou may be ready to be with the splendid bunch that will talk things overso tat the South may grow in prosperity, in farm life, in home life and inneighborhoods.FARMERS' CLUBSProf. A. D. Wilson.The press of the country for thepast several years has been full of thewonderful work done by the Boys' andGirls' Corn and Tomato Clubs. Naturally, it would seem time for us tohave something in the press concerning clubs for farmers and their wives.Some work in successful farmers'clubs has been done in the State oMinnesota and Prof. A. D. Wilson, ofthe Extension Department of StateUniversity is the man who has developed it. riis wide experience in thisfield has appealed so strongly to thosein charge of the program for the Farmers and Business Men's Conference,that arrangements were made for himto come to te meeting at Louisville,April 7-10, to develop the same enthusiasm that has attended the work inhis home state. He is a speaker ofability, and it is hoped that he may enthuse our farmers to the point of organizing some clubs in Kentucky andIn the South for this year.The Conference in Louisville, April7-8-9-10, is of such Importance that extremjly low railroad rates have beenmade.

Such an overt act might-easilylead to an immediate abandonmentof the Administration's policy of"watchful wating" and the substtution therefor of armed intervention,which would be equivalent to war under the circumstances.This danger is recognized by publicmen who were apprised of the factof the expedition into Mexico and itssuccessful outcome. Thus the situation has become more acute than everbefore, with the chances of intervention materially enhanced. .Governor Colquitt connived at'a "direct violation of the constitution.which vests only the General Government with the right of invasion of aforeign country, and may be held tobe guilty of technical treason.

The light paint (which can hardly be told from varnish) isfor interior work. Tne white paint is for both interior and exteriorwork, and can be made sufficiently thin to use in a spraying machine,enabling the person applying it to reach inaccessible places, and covering all of the surface.We feel that the foregoing statements will cause von to investigate,and surely you will do so when we tell you that the cost is only a triflemore than half that of any good paint.All inquiries carefully answered.CINCINNATI REPRESENTATIVEJ, W.

As no convict can be released until he has secured employment, and as many of them are notskilled laborers, they are eagerly taking advantage of the opportunity tosecure their liberty by working on afarm.

Everywherethroughout the State are to be foundorchards that have been neglected foryears. The trees are often toocrowded, which forces the topmostbranches to reach up for sunlight 'thusproducing a tail, uneven tree with adense heavy top. The lower branchesare either dead or covered with numerous cankers because the air andsunlight cannot get in keeping thtlimbs in a health condition. Oeadwood is abundant, especially in thecenter of the tree.An orchard similar to the above cannot be a profitable one. Fruit borneon trees of this kind will be small andinferior and will be produced only atthe sides and tops of the trees. All ofthe bearing wood will be on the outside of the tree and none on the inside. It is safe to say that only onequarter of the tree is producing fruit.The other three quarters are simplyallowing the bearing part to pay forthe keeping of the tree.In pruning an old tree that hasbeen neglected for some time the firstthing to do isto remoye the beadthing to do is to remove all deadbranches. Next look for diseasedbranches and get rid of them. If the1 Hiediseased limb be a valuable one, theaffected part may be cut out and thewound treated with a good disinfec -tant.

WhenAnglo-Saxton surnames were added oradopted in the Eleventh and Twelfthcenturies some seem to have beentaken haphazzard, and are of no significance. Our colored people retained, in the main, after freedom, thesurname of "Old Mastah." Most ofthem felt proud of the family whomthey served and spoke of them as"my white folks." "No corger bloodin our family, and us cullored onesain't got no use for po' white folks,"so often used by the negro servant,had no general reference to financialconditions, meaning, rather, socialstatus "Mannahs and customs," asthey sometimes expressed it.Example of Missouri Negro.One example of family fealty is thecase of Nelson Crews. This reallyremarkable negro was born on theDlantation of Dr. Samuel Crews, ofHoward county, Missouri, who at thattime owned over 500 negro servants.His parents were far above the average in intelligence and integrity.Joanna, the fine old mother of Nelsonrews. lives now in Kansas City.She was the weaver of the Crewsiiome, and I believe there are woolencounterpanes yet in the possession ofthe family that bear evidence of herskill. From remarks made to me bya member of Dr. Crews' family a fewdays ago, they "our white folks," feela pride in the fact that Nelson Crewshelps to perpetuate the fine old name,and so creditably.With us yet is a staunch, dependable negro woman, industrious andself-supporting, though long past threescore years and ten, who, though shehas led to the altar yes, led to theword three husbands, has neverchanged her surname; she eithermade pre-nuptial arrangements withher various suitors of brought themto taw afterward, for Susan Clarkshe was, is and ever will be. "I wasbo'n and bred on the plantation ofBeverly R. Clark, the finest whitefolks in Kaintucky or any whah uponthe yeath, and twel I meets up with abettah name I don't see no'casion tochange mine," insists Aunt Susan.The numerous Collinses, Bradleys,Simpsons, Stones, Smarts hereaboutsbear out my assertion that negroesafter freedom selected for tlieir own ithe surnames of former owners.Howard, Scott and Wallace Smith, jnegroes, good and creditable citizens jof the vicinity of Kansas City, Mo.,were slaves in the family of a sister Iof Cassius Clay. Though they areproud of the fact that they are of theClav clan of colored folks, they prefer Smith, the name of the memberof the family to whom they were assigned. Among their proudest possessions is a portrait of a handsome,distinguished looking white man, inscribed on the margin this testimony:"For My'Dear Old MammyFrom Green Clay Smith."Nominated As President.The donor was, you remember,nominated Presidential candidate bythe Liberal Republican party.Whether Hadley Bradley came byhis mirious coraoman of his own freewill or force of circumstances I couldnever learn. This zealous colored"pasture," as he was called by hisfaithful flock, boasts of being a servant in the house of President Andrew Jackson. Why so loyal an adherant of "Mass General" didn't addJackson to his alliterative appellation seems strange. He could havehardlv considered its inference withI poetical possibilities. One of the mj cidents Uncle Hadley was fond of re' lating in praise of "Old Hickory" was!in the proof of his devotion to hiswife; by the unction ana irequeuuyof its reiteration lie evmenuy ueeuieuthis a clincher. "Old Mass Gineral didsho' love his wife, hit moighty nighbroke his heart when she died and hepeared lak he jes can't give her up."An exception as proving a, iuicthat negroes retained the surnames offormer owners was the case of a notnA To-rn nf nlden davs here. Jackson, a long, lank, capable "hand," ona farm now in the heart of KansasCity, was bought when quite youngbv a civil engineer with the first onethousand dollars he saved from hissalary. Jack was pleased with Insyoung master, was faithful and respect, but he would never adopt hissurname. "No, young Mistis," he replied when asked why, "I ain't gwmeback on the name my dady an' rnamywent by; ef Scruggs was good enoughfor dey it pintedly is good enough forme Den I'm bound to say that Capt.Scruggs was a fine old genplemurman a good mastah ad' 'sheets' to bardat name twel I die."Jackson married Rachel, the widowof a free man. Harry Smith. Harrv, though free,. remained in the service of his "white folks," Col. Chicksfamily, until his death in 1849. HaVryhoueht a lot in Kansas City, on Mamstreet, near Missouri avenue. Alterhis death the widow either could notor would not pay the taxes on thisProperty. When it was about to besold for taxes she vas unable to redeem it, so her master gave her $50for the lot, which including the taxes,was all it was worth, she affixed hercross mark to the deed of conveyance,contending at the same time that hername was by rights Collins, "Cose datde name I was bohn wid," hut she waspersuaded to sign" Smith.No Question of Origin.There is no question the origin lo -cally of the Tallaferros. Negroes andwhite folks as well pronounce thatdistinguished old name Taliver. Thereare, or were, quite a number bearingthat surname in the city. We had afamily of colored people here namedBenoist. Though not serving whitepeople of that name, they clung to itjecatise they were proud to have onceoeen members of that distinguishedfamily of French residents of St.Louis.. A number of negroes after freedomretained the name Troost, some ofthem excellent and honorable peoplein their hunmble stations in slaverydays and after. Could the city's street"namers" have had this in mind whenapplying that name to the busythoroughfare? If so, that may settlevexed question, 'Vhy Troost Avenue?" No one could or would say aword against the good, unassuming,unnoted Dr. Troost, but his huhmblecareer could warrant no such distinction as having one of the principalstreets named after him.Jabez Smith, a painter, near Independence, owned at one time morethan 600 negroes. It is said he didnot know half of them by sight. Inview of this fact, it seems singularthat negroes with Smith for surnamesare not more unmerous.The prevalence of the many curous,fanciful, veen absurd given names ofnegroes in the old days is more easilyaccounted for. Negro mothers, no account of the oft-recurring in rapidsuccession of visits from the stork,were put to it, so to speak, to findnames for their babies, so they wouldask the white folks to assist in theselection. This gave sentimentalyoung mistresses on young men heroworshipers pr with romantic predilections opportunity to bestow upon thehelpless infants favorite and notednames of history and fiction; henceCcipio, Caesar, Napoleon, Pompey,Cupid, Paris, Remus, Nebuchadnezzar(dwindled down to Buck), Caledonia,Pandora, Arminta, Fatima, Ursula,Cleopatra and other equally as farfetched were lavishly interspersedamong plain, every-day cognomens.Named Many White Sables.On the other hand, negro mammiesoccasionally named white babies.Birdie Fisher, the contralto singer,now in Chicago, was named by a capable, faithful mammy negro who neverleft the service of her mistress andaided in every way in rearing the children of the Fisher family.An eminent physician of the oldentimes had a man servant with thesame given name as his own. Thisman William attended to his master'soffice, kept the books, accompaniedhim usually on his visits to patients,and did the bleeding and cupping sofrequently restored to by the old-tmedoctor. When the Civil War endedand William was free both he and hisformer 'owner began the practice ofmedicine in the same town. Fromdoorways on opposite sides of thesame street swung signs each reading "Dr. William Warren."Disturbed cdhditions prevented astrict enforcement of ordinances in regard to licenses. The relations between the two Dr. Warrens continued,the white physician advising his former servant in perplexing cases andassisting in the serious ones, the colored M. D. rendering as of old, anyaid in his power to "Old Mastah."-Kirby Smith, a pioneer of Jacksoncounty, whose farm is now within thecity limits, owned scores of negroservants. A while after the close ofthe war he was complimented on thefine body of land he possessel. "Yes,"he replied; "oh, yes, the farm is a fineone, but I miss my negroes; honestlyI would rather have back my trusty,good servants than own all the landbetween here and St. Louis. I'mlonesome without the cheery lightblazing fires on the cabin hearthswhich shone from the ever-open doorsthe whole year round regardless ofweather. I miss the loud guffaws,the dancing, the melody of the oldcorn gathering songs, the cheerful,willing service. You may take theblank plantaiton if you will just brin?back my own negroes souna ana wenand happy as when they were takenfrom me."Tom Bass, the noted negro horseman, not only retains his old master'ssurname, but continues to pursue thebusiness congenial to the old-timeBass clan.BATTLE IN CAB OFA LOCOMOTIVE.MOBILE, Ala., March 6.
