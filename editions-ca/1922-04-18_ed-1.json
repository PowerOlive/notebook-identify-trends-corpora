SHE WAS A DISCONTENTED WIFE, and she longed for luxury at the expense of her husband's good name and honor. The price
they paid, however, was a high one the price that is usually paid when a man commits a crime for the sake of an extravagant wife and
is then engulfed in the sea of evil consequence. For breathless, thrilling drama it is unsurpassed with a punch at the finish that is a
knockout. Don't miss it.

MAY McAVOY JSSfr. "MORALS"
THE COLOR AND SPLENDOR OF THE EAST Out of the seclusion and security of a Turkish harem Out of the warmth and lan
guor of the East to be dropped suddenly Into the chill of a London fog Into the bachelor household of a man she had never seen.
Ands so into his startled, lonely heart. And there to dwell like a strange, exotic flower until a friend's perfidy, another woman's jealous
plotting, and a great danger brought almost too late the realization of loye triumphant.
Here is big drama: tense swift-moving scenes gorgeous settings the radiance and emotional witchery of May McAvoy a bril
liant cast and one of the great stories of all time one that has thrilled 'millions as novel and play. All the color and splendor of the

"The Journey's End"
With Wyndham Standing Mabel Baffin
and George Bancroft
Can, you imagine any strange contrast than between the life she had lived and that which she was now to know? First, linked
to a laborer rough, rugged, uncouth struggling, morning, noon and night to make both ends meet. Then luxury her every wish, an
ticipated; her every desire fulfilled by the man she loved best in the world. Happy was her heart as she lay in the steamer-chair mus
ing on the days which were past and those which were to come. Little did she know that Fate was building up to the strangest climax
ever unfolded either in real life or upon the silver screen. You're going to enjoy every moment of this fascinating picture a picture as
beautiful as it is dramatic, as unusual as it is entertaining.

WILD ONIONS CAUSINGL TROUBLE
FOR DAIRYMEN.
Wild onions again are causing
many Kentucky dairymen trouble in
the form of tainted milk, according
to jnquiries being received at the
College of Agriculture. The only
known way to handle the problem
is ta take cow3 out of the pasture:;
infested with the weed several hours
before milking time, J. J. Hooper,
head of the college dairy department
says.
"We have found that much of the
trouble can be eliminated by turn
ing the cows nrto, the infested past
urcs immediately after they have
been milked and then taking them
out in three or four hours and plac
ing them in a barn lot or clean,
pasture until they are milked. It ia
well also to pour the milk over a
cooler as this helps to get rid of
some cf the cnion odor and flavor."

Blanton have" beerf -furnishing some
