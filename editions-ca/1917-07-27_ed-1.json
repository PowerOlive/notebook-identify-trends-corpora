HOUNDING THE PRESS.
(New York World.)
The Senate Finance Committee has
decided to raise the second-clas:?
postal rate one-fourth of a cent a
pound.
This device should yield some rev
enue unless the number of pounds of
newspapers and magazines should be
much lessened, as in the circum
stances seems likely. Needless to
say, it means a departure from our
time-honored policy of favoring by
reasonable postage the spread of in
formation. Like any other Government policy,
that policy can be changed, though
readers will demand proof of the
wisdom of the reversal. This will bs
even more difficult in the case of the
proposed tax of 5 per cent, on publi
cation profits. To adopt this pro
posal would be not taxing but hound
ing the press.
Newspapers and magazines are not
"war brides," reveiling in sudden
wealth. Far from enriching them,
the war has burdened all, ruined
many. Every material cost has sharp
ly increased; the revenue has in most
cases diminished. One has only to
look at what happened to the press
of Europe in war time to see where
the present tendency may lead.
Every tax that the community
bears the press bears. The corpora
tion tax, the income tax against its
workers, it would gladly pay if there
were any excess profits. It performs,
in addition, a service which it does
not look upon as a tax, but which to
the Government is invaluable, in
promoting the sale of bonds, recruit
ing and all Government war activi
ties. It has a right to expect in re
turn fair treatment from Congress,
and not to be singled out for dis
criminatory burdens.

NATIONAL SECURITY LEAGUE'S
CAMPAIGN.
The greatest patriotic educational
campaign this country has ever seen
is being organized by the National
Security League. It is a campaign to
arouse the people of the nation to a
realization of what the war means
and what their patriotic duty is.
The first definite plans were laid at
a meeting of prominent educators
called by the Security League in
New York early in May. Since then,
college and university presidents and
professors, university extension sys
tems, Chautauquas, writers, lawyers,
editors, judges, politicians and busi
ness men in all parts of the country
have endorsed the idea and promised
the Security League their fullest co
operation in carrying it out.
The League's plan is to organize
through its Committee of Patriotism
Through Education, of which Prof.
Albert Bushnell Hart, of Harvard
University, is Chairman, a system of
addresses on patriotic and war topics
by means of which trained speakers
will carry into every city, town and
hamlet in every State in the Union
the following messages: The causes
of the war, the reasons for the en
trance of this country into the con
flict, what the United States must
do to carry out its part, and the
knowledge that not only the exist
ence of democracy in the abstract, but
also the very life of this nation itself
depends upon victory over Germany.
Over four hundred university and
college presidents and professors
have already volunteered to actively
take the field in carrying on this
great campaign. The presidents of
over one hundred universities and
colleges will either personally make
addresses or have suggested mem
bers of their faculties who are will
ing to contribute their services. The
leading Chautauquas are adding
patriotic addresses in their programs.
At the numerous annual conventions
of fraternal, business and educational
societies and associations, which take
place in various parts of the country
during the Summer, particular ses
sions will be devoted to the campaign.
"Wake Up, America!" and "Tell
the People" are the watchwords of
the National Security League in this
campaign. The object is to arouse
every individual citizen on the United
States to a realization of the mean
ing of the war and the importance of
personal service and sacrifice in
bringing it to a successful conclusion.

PRICES AND VALUES.
(St. Louis Post-Dispatch.)
One of the results of the changed
cost of living in the past few years
has been a confusion of prices with
values by those who try to measure
the values of commodities to-day with
those of a decade or so ago. An
anecdote illustrative of the point is
told in a recent circular letter by a
lumber industry.
A Missouri farmer, as the story
runs, kicked because his dealer offer
ed him for $90 the same kind of
buggy that his father bought 20
years ago for $50. The merchant,
upon investigation, found that the
father paid for his vehicle with 300
bushels of corn. Whereupon he
offered to give his customer in ex
change for 300 bushels of corn the
following articles:
One $90 buggy.
One $75 wagon.
One $20 suit of clothes.
One $20 dress for his wife.
One $2 dress for his baby.
One $5 crib for the baby.
One $3 box of cigars.
$10 worth of sugar.
$10 worth of tea.
$100 worth of gasoline.
$15 worth of lubricating oil.
The farmer refused the offer, paid
$90 for his buggy and departed sat
isfied. !S fe fe
SHE GAVE AWAY $300,000.
A strange story of unselfishness
and reversed fortunes is told in the
American Magazine. It has to do
with Mrs. Mrs. Marks Nathan.
"In Chicago the name of Marks
Nathan is standardized as typifying
Jewish charities. There are several
Marks Nathan institutions, several
Marks Nathan funds, a half dozen
Marks Nathan scholarships.
"Mrs. Nathan and her late husband
gave fully $300,000 to charities.
After her husband's death Mrs. Na
than gave away more until she. had
only $10,000 left upon which to live.
That was lost in a bank failure, and
now she is penniless and an inmate
in a Home for Aged and Indigent
Jews, of which she herself is a di
rector.
"She began by making wire frames
for hats with her own hands, for
individuals, and expanded to a shop
with several helpers for the limited
market of those days. Then a great
piece of fortune came along hoop
skirts swept into fashion and she
swept along to a handsome profit by
turning her facilities to the manufac
ture of wire hoops.
"With some of her earnings she
bought a piece of land. The $8,000
she invested became $40,000 when
she sold it as part of the site of the
Santa Fe terminal. With $20,000 of
that she bought prairie land on what
was then the city limits, and a few
years later sold it for $150,000 as
the spot for the Illinois Central de
pot. Thereafter she made several

PLOCKETT MIDDLETON
EADES BARNES.
Eld. W. E. Ellis, pastor of the
Paris Christian church, was called
upon Wednesday to perform the wed
ding ceremony for two Lexington
couples, who came here to escape the
petty annoyances and inconveniences
of getting married in a small place.
Wednesday morning Eld. Ellis at
his residence, corner ( of Main and
Tenth streets, performed the cere
mony uniting for better or for worse
the hands and hearts of Miss Bessie
Pockett and Mrs. James H. Middle
ton, both giving Lexington as their
residence.
At four o'clock Wednesday after
noon a blushing bridal-pair again
stood at Eld. Ellis' door, invoking his
help in relief from single statedness.
They were Miss Mary Eades and Mr.
H. G. Barnes, also of Lexington. Eld.
Ellis performed the marriage cere
mony for them and sent them on
their way with his blessing.
STEGEMAN URMSTON.
The marriage of Miss Agnes
Stegeman and Mr. Homer Urmston,
both of Hamilton, Ohio, was very
quitely celebrated in Paris, Tuesday
afternoon at the home of the officiat
ing minister, Rev. George H. Harris,
rector of St. Peter's Episcopal church.
The couple, accompanied, by Mr.
Louis Rapp, of Hamilton, motored to
Lexington, Tuesday, for a short visit
to Mr. and Mrs. Howard Gassaway,
and decided to marry in this quiet
nay. They were entertained with a
beautiful luncheon at noon by Mr.
and Mrs. Gassaway, and later in the
day, accompanied by Mr. and Mrs.
Gassaway, Dr. and Mrs. Gassaway,
Miss Gassaway, of Illinois, and Mr.
Rapp, motored to Paris for the cere
mony.
After a short wedding trip and
visit to relatives in Lexington, they
will return to Hamilton, where they
will make their home in the future.
The bride is a very beautiful young
girl, and was very much admired by
those who saw her here.
Mr. Urmston is a very popular
popular young business man of Ham
ilton, where he is associated in busi
ness with his father. The news will
come as a "very great surprise to the
family and friends, the secret having
been so well guarded.

NEW RUSE TO MAKE MONEY.
(New York Cor. Pittsburg Dispatch.)
It is necessary at all times that the
apartment housewife of this village
should concentrate her mind on her
pocketbook. If she happens to forget
it someone is sure to break in on
her weekly allowance, for there is a
busy bunch of highbinders here who
are forever thinking up ways and
means of getting something for noth
ing. The latest wrikle is the laundry
dumbwaiter game. This is the way it
is worked: A man at the foot of the
dumbwaiter shaft represents himself
as the agent of the laundry which
the woman patronizes. He informs
her that a sum of money has been
found in the clothing she sent out.
The woman is at first positive that
she was not so careless, but upon the
insistence that she has had a lapse
of memory. Then comes the old
"hocus pocus." The man says he has
only a large bill, having given all
his change to another laundry pat
ron in the apartment house. Sup
posing the sum of money which the
man says was found in the laundry to
be $1.65, ie asks the woman to put
$3.35 on the dumbwaiter and send
it down and he will send back up a
$5 bill, the smallest change he has.
The prospect of getting the $1.65
lulls the victim into security, and
she obeys the instructions. After
she has waited a half hour for tho
$1.65, she telephones the police. But
there is one in every apartment
house every minute.

TALKING MOVIES.
Application has been made tor a
patent on a very elaborate device
which would produce a combination
of the cinematograph and the phono
graph to give us moving pictures
wherein the characters not only move
but speak. The idea of soul pictures
is not new, but the difficulties of
synchronizing have hitherto proved
insurmountable. By synchronizing
is meant the exact coincidence of the
motion picture, projected by one ma
chine, with the speech supposed to
proceed from the characters, which
is produced by quite another. Unless
the speech comes at the right in
stant, the result is laughable rather
than impressive. In the proposed de-'
vice, the actual speech of the char
acters is transmitted by wireless tele
phone to a phonograph whose com-
receiying mechanism

FARMERS.
Old Cadmus was a farmer,
Though born to spear and shield;
Arrayed in brazen armor,
He tilled a stubborn field.
With dragons' teeth he sowed it then
And from Boeotian glebes
There leaped the valiant fighting men
That crowned the walls of Thebes.
Old Cadmus was our brother;
A goodly crop he grew
As we shall grow another
That blow the acres, too.
Our garden beds and fertile farms
Shall yield the strength divine
That nerves the mighty man-at-arms
And build the battle line.
Then bravely to your labors,
My lads that dig the loam!
Your blades of wheat are sabers
That strike for flag and home.
And though ye gain but little thanks
That wield the spade and hoe,
Your hills of corn are stalwart ranks
That march against the foe!

A FEATHER FOR OUR CAP.
The last two years have splendidly
demonstrated to the world the vigor
ous enterprise and daring of Ameri
can manufacturers and the astonish
ing intelligence and adaptability oZ
American labor in connection with
munitions making. They have been
severely tested; they have borne tho
test with a success that must have
surprised themselves; they have
raised the reputation of American in
dustralism abroad to a level it had
never reached before. And what they
have accomplished for the Allies is,
of course, as nothing by the side of
what they can and will accomplish
for their own country. Sydjiey
