this character at the church in eight
years. The confirmation vows were
administered by Bishop Brossart, of
Covington, Bishop of this diocese,
with a large number of visiting
priests from other charges assisting
Rev.- Father wm. O'Hare in the ex
ercises. Among them were Rev.
Father Thomas Coleman, of Ludlow,
predecessor of Rev. Father O'Hare,
and Rev. Father Decius Carrol, of
Cynthiana, were known here. The
confirmation exerciseh were solemn
and impressive. The cnurch was
filled to capacity with an incereoted
audience.
Preceding and following the con-
firamtion Rev. Father Thomas Cole
man, former pastor of the Paris
church, was given an enthusiastic
welcome and impromtu reception by
his former parishioners. He is still
in fancy, their beloved pastor,
though now removed to a new
charge at Ludlow. Father Coleman
experienced considerable difficulty
in evading his enthusiastic welcom-
ers long enough to assist in the con
firmation exercises, and after they
were over, held a levee, which the
congregation seemed determined he
should.

(COUNTY CLERKS LOSE FIGHT FOR
EXTRAS
The county clerks of Kentucky
Tuesday lost their light for an addi
tional 5 per cent, commission for
issuing antomobile licenses other
than is allowed by the act of 1920,
when the Court of Appeals ruled
against them.
It was the Clerks' contention that
under sections 4195 and 4242 of the
Kentucky Statutes, the clerk was al
lowed a 5 per cent, commission for
collecting licenses generally.
County Clerk S. Higgins Lewi3,
Fayette county, in making his re
port to the State Auditor of money
collected due the State, retained, the
5 per cent, that had been collected
by him. He and J. B. Nash, Frank
fort, filed suit against the State Tax
Commission to compel that f body to
grant an allowance of 5 per cent.
These steps were taken at the in
stance of the County Clerks Associ-J
