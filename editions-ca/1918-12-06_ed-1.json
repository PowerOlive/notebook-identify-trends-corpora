. The following is an extract from
a letter recently received by Mrs.
John J. Sweeney, of Paris, from her
son. Dr. John Sweeney, "who has been
in France for some time:
"Am no longer -with the 341st In

A German trench helmet, made of
thin pressed' steel, weighing four

a few days ago by Mrs. Emma L. Car
ter, of near Paris. The helmet was
sent by her son, Thodore Carter,
who is a member of the American
Expeditionary Forces lately engaged
on the --battle front in France.
Carter stated in a letter of expla
nation to his mother that the name
of the owner of the helmet could be
found on the inside of the headgear,
but that he could not give the pres
ent address of the man who once
wore it. The helmet came by parcel

be taught how to care for themselves
and their wounds will be scientmc
ally healed with- all the skilltand care
that a grateful Government can be
stow upon them. 1
The writer recently had the priv
ilege of visiting West Baden Springs,
where the Government opened' up one
of the largest, and most beautiful re
creative hospitals in Amerioa last
week. This was formerly the famous
West Baden Springs Hotel, known all
over the country as one of the show
spots " of America. This beautiful
hostelry has been converted as if by
the magic touch of a fairy wand into
a modern hospital, cbmplete in every
respect in all its appointments, it
has been equipped with accommoda
tion for about 1,400 patients. .At the
time the writer was there the new
hospital had a list of wounded men,
about three hundred in number, who
had been invalided home from battle
torn France. Others are being
brought there every week on special
trains plying between that point and
Newport News, Va., a disembarka
tion point. ' " K
On Sunday morning we witnessed
the detrainment of one hundred and
forty-seven maimed and crippled
boys who had been overseas and lived
to tell the tale in the evidence of
their suffering. They had been sent
home for treatment. It was. a sad
sight and tending to make one leel
the realization of what war really
means. Twenty of these boys were
being handled on stretchers. Three
army ambulances were being Used for
the purpose of bringing thehi from
the train to the hospital. We talked
to a number of these men, and in the
course of the conversation 'gleaned
many new and very interesting facts,
incidents telling of the terrible er
fects of the war, and descriptions of
the life in the army overseas. One
voung fellow, named Raymond Bruf
fey, of Kansas City, only sixteen
years old, was an especially interest
ing talker. He had been wounded in
the shoulder by shrapnel at the bat
tle of Verdun, and also had an ugly
wound in the right side inflicted by
the bayonet of a Boche, who he said,
had gone away from here. A portion
of the little finger of his right hand
had been carried away by a bullet
from a German revolver. He was
cheerful and happy, and said he
would do it all over again if his
country needed his services. -
Another man we saw at that place
had been shot through the right lung.
The field surgeons a short time after
he was brought in extracted the bul
let from under the skin in his1 back.
He carries the bullet in his -Tchaki
trousers as a mute reminder of his
experience, and congratulations that
it might have been woiseV 'His
name is Wm. Gorham, and his-residence,
Lexington, Ky. He is now at
home on a furlough. Other remarka
ble cases that are being taken care
of at this hospital are those of a
young man who was shot between
the eyes, the bullet passing entirely
through his head; another who was
wounded in the heart, and on whom
the surgeons performed what -is said
to have been one of the most wonder
ful and delicate operations known to
mp.rilnn.1 science, closing theAvound,

JO. VARDEN,
Letters received from hijm some J treating it. and enabling hini to be
back at Wiest Badpn to recuperate,
another who received a bullet in his
throat, piercing the windpipe, so that
he had to be supplied with a silver
tube inserted in his neck. When this
poor fellow endeavored to talk he
would have to place a finger 'on the
end of the tube and close it. An
other American soldier whose back
had been broken in a trench, strug
gle with Gerpnan soldiers was so well
taken care of that he was enabled to
stand the passage back to Amerga,
but was so badly shaken up on the
railroad trip to West Baden, wnen
very near his destination, that he
died Sunday. Other men we saw had
been shot through the. arms, should
ers and hips a number had been
gassed and some had contracted tu
berculosis. Most of the cases, how
ever, were doing very nitfely und
their attending surgeons say tliey
will eventually recover entirely.
They were bright and cheerful, and
happy, but some of them a- little
homesick. They were all very en
thusiastic over the wonderful treat
ment accorded them by the Red
Cross and the Salvation Army, toey
making especial mention of these
ur-n-nn-hixz nf the relief workers over
seas and in their own country. Ihe
,majority of the wounded men receiv
ed their wounds in the battles of
Chateau-Thierry, Verdun and the Ar
ragon Woods. Being transferred from
one place to another so rapidly tliey
said many of them had not been able
to connect with the paymaster frmn
four months to a year.
The hospital is being nitea up w
take care of 1,400 patients. It is the
intention of the Government-to locate
all the wounded boys there who have
resided within a radius of six hun
dred miles from the Springs, while at
present the patients are from all
parts of the United States. The boys
will be made whole again, as far as
