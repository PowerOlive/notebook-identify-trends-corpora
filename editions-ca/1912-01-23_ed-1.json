Saturday, January 20th,
At 8 O'Clock, p. m., We Opened Our Doors With a
Sale That Eclipse Anything Ever Before
Attempted in Paris.
Several large Eastern manufacturers, anticipating a
record-breaking holiday trade, stocked heavily so as to
take care of "hurry orders." The unseasonable weather
and the lack of snow in December, throughout the entire
country, affected the Shoe industry more than other lines,
and "hurry orders'"' were few and far between. Our
buyers, always tin the spot, finally induced them, owing
to our immense outlet, to consign these goods to Dan
Cohen to be converted into ready money.

Creek Rise Breaks Ice.
The sudden rise of Stoner creek Fri
day follwoing a brief warm spell broke
the ice which was frozen to a thick
ness of fromafour to six inched and the
crystal began to flow in the swift
stream Friday looming. When the
ice first gave way, according to those
who witnessed the spectacle it W2S
gorged in some places to a height of
six or seven feet. Up until noon Fri
day the ice continued to flow, caused
by the break farther up the stream.
This is the first time in the memory
of the oldest citizens that an ice flow
has occurred in Stoner crdek.

THEATRICAL.
"THE GAMBLERS."
Charles Klein's greatest play, "The
Gamblers," which run throughout last
season at Maxine Elliott's Theatre,
New York, comes to the Grand tonight,
Tuesday. The story of life play has to
dog with a group of bankers, the
youngest member of whicn agrees to
go to jail and pay the penalty for a
techincal offense of which all are
guilty, provided his father, an inno
cent man, shall not suffer. The "story
of the attempt of the young bank
officer to get all the others free, and
his love for the wife of the cold-blooded
prosecuting attorney, innocently
brought into the affair, is one of the
most gripping plays theatregoers have
had offered them in many a day.
This is a Kl?w & Erlanger produc
tion and one of the strongest nlavs,
I both scenically and in regard to cast?
of characters that this well known
copmany has this s.eason. Seats may
be reserved at Mitchell & Blakemore's
Saturday. The Lexington Opera
House Orchestra will furnish the
music.
"THE GIRL FROM U. S. A."
"The Girl From U. S. A." which
appears at the Paris Grand on next
! Friday, .lanuary 26, is said to be a
literary invention. It makes everybody
sit up and take notice. Though show
ing in its evolution the social life of
', the orient in its two most striking
phases, it is so vividly American in
.sentiment, so vigorously clever in
! dialpgue, and astonishingly true as to
type and characters, that no one ever
thinks that any of it exciting compli
! cations or other than the natural
i events of real life portrayed so strik
! mgly. Of course it is a love story.
A story of hate also with its twin
J revenge of unlawful desire and law
j'ful triumph. And it shows in vivid
i gleams the complicated politics of
other lands, and the close relationship
I of our own government with the one
free press on earth, whose mighty
. voice rontrols the world and decides
the fates of individuals and nations.
' Prices 25 and 35 cents. Resreved seats
at Mitchell & Blakemore's.
