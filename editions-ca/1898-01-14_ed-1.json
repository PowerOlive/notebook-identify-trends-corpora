GUNNERY PRACTICE
An Occasion When Quickness of Action
Prevented a Fearful Disaster
An officer of the United States navy
relates the f ollowingas illustrating some
of the perils of gunnery at sea
I came very near going np into the
air in small bits on this last squadron
cruise We were at heavy gun practice
at sea and but for the quickness of a
gunners mate would never have re
turned As you probably know the
heavy gxms in the turrets are fired by
electricity the gun being discharged
simply by pressing a button The officer
in command of the forward turret on
our ship during rapid firing practice was
just about to press the button to fire one
of our big guns when a gunners mate
was seen to grab at something on the
wall of the turret and then fall in a
heap on the floor The officer pressed
the button but the gun was not dis
charged When the mate came to he
vas asked what had happened and he
informed the officer thai the breech of
the gun had not been locked and that
what he grabbed at on the wall was the
wires forming the electrie firing circuit
When he saw that the officer was pre
paring to fire the gun and at the same
time observed that the breech of the
gun was not locked the only thing that
occurred to him to prevent the gun be
ing discharged was to destroy the cir
cuit which he did promptly and effect
ively When all this occurred there
was a charge of 250 pounds of powder
in the gnu another charge of the same
size in the turret ready to be served and
the passageway leading to the powder
magazine was wide open But for the
quickness of the gunners mate the gun
would have been blown out inside the
turret the gases from the burning pow
der would probably have ignited the
charge lying in the turret this explo
sion would have ignited the powder in
the magazine and the chances are that
the whole ship crew and all would
have gone up in the air A thought that
has occurred to me is this Suppose the
accident had occurred what do you
imagine the verdict of a board of in
quiry as to the cause of the loss of the
ship would have been Since his experi
ence the department has adopted elec
trical means to prevent the discharge of
any of the large guns until the breech
is locked San Francisco Chronicle

I had such a severe case of

Sick Fish
When a fish in an aquarium is ailing
or injured it is put into a reserve tank
out of sight of the visitors and where
it can be looked after at any time The
circulation of the tank is adjusted with
great nicety to give the fish the greatest
possible amount of water and with the
constant renewal of water the greatest
possible amount of fresh air A fresh
water fish roay be treated with salt wa

What Colonel Bill Switzler Says
The impression is general that Mis
souri river water is dirty that the big
river flows about two parts of dirt and
one of mud but the impression is erro
neous for the Missouri rivers water is
purer than the water of any great river
in the country the Platte alone except
ed It is true that when a bucketful of
it is dipped up it appears to be dirty
but if the water is left until it settles it
will be found that the sediment at the
ibottom is fine dark colored sand and
not mud The Missouri rivers water is
never muddy save during the spring
high water
Colonel Bill Switzler of Boonville
Mo declares that the general idea that
Missouri means big muddy or mud
dy water is wrong He says and Col
onel Bill Switzler is an authority- that
it means wooden canoe The name
he says belongs to the Illinois dialect
of the Algonquin Indians The name
Missuris or Missouri was applied by the
Indians of the upper lake region to the
tribe of Indians living west of the Mis
sissippi river oecauso tne latter usea
wooden canoes instead of birch bark
canoes
Wooden canoes had to be used on the
Missouri river because it was too turbu
lent for the frail birch bark canoes and
in this way the big river secured its
name But no matter whether Missouri
means muddy water or wooden
canoe the fact remains that Missouri
river water is not muddy It does not
flow through mud but through fine
sand The Mississippi river water is 100
per cent dirtier than the Missouri but

blue of the Father of Waters -Omaha

Tennysons Slip
Lord Tennyson is in his
2 page 14 reported to have said
I never put two ss together in any
verse of mino My line is not as often
quoted
And freedom broadens slowly down
but
And freedom slowly broadens down
On reading this I opened my Tennyson
casually and the first piece I saw was
Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere
which contains four instances of the
double s namely
Sometimes the linnet piped his song
She seemed a part of joyous spring
As she iled
t
A she swayed
The next piece is The Farewell
which has the line
No more by thee my steps shall be
The next piece is The Beggar Maid
which has the consecutive lines
As shines the moon hi clouded ekies
She in her poor attire was seen
Thinking that perhaps Lord Tennyson
referred to his blank verse I turned to
the Dedication of the Idylls in
which I find these two lines
Or how should England dreaming of his eous
and
Till Gods lovo Bet thee at his side again
LordvTennyson must I think hayobeent

Marriage In England
Englishmen now it is said are emu
lating the French in the absolute disin
clination to marry When they do de
cide to take this important step they
now frequently insist upon that dot
which is part of the French idea of a
successful and convenable marriage
I The real fact of the matter- is that the or
dinary modern Englishman has no desire
to disturb his bachelor estate Hhe has
no title no special wealth no great his
toric name to hand down to posterity
single blessedness is good enough for
him -This state of mind is attributed
by many to the growing independence
of women Possibfy this is true prob
ably it is not Mercenary spirits boldly
assert that marriages in England will
on the whole never be successful until
women bring dots to their husbands
since gold inspires respect if not love
Marriage on a strictly business basis is
evidently the future for all English wo
men to look forward to rSan Fracfcisco

man of highly respectable appearance
They both stood transfixed The same
idea flashed across both of them
Your face istamiliar to me very
familiar but I cant remember where

However the friendly impulse was
carried out They shook hands warmly
partook of a friendiyglass and departed
still ignorant of each others name and

But the young man was determined
to solve the problem and he seized on a

Who is that distinguished stranger
