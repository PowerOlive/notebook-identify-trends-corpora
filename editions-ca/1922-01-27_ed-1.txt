Haggard, residing on Cypress street, whohad become alarmed at the silencewhich seemed to envelope her homeand by her prolonged absence underwhat seemed to them suspicious circumstances, conducted an investigation late Wednesday afternoon, andxo their horror, found Mrs. Haggarddead in bed. Coroner Rudolph Davis "was at once summoned, and afteran investigation, decided the agedoraan had met her death fromasphyxiation.According to the story told by someof the neighbors and a physician whohad been hurriedly summoned, Mrs.Haggard had spent Tuesday night atthe bedside of Mrs. Ben Schooler,who had been very ill at her homenear Clintonville. She returned toher home on Cypress street at an-early hour Wednesday morning, andwas seen to enter the house. Thisivas the last time she was seen alive.N-eighbors became alarmed when theydid not see her about the house therest of the day and about 6:30 o'clockWednesday night decided to investigate, thinking something was wrong.They were unable to get into thehouse, and knowing the location ofher bed room, one of the men climbedto the window on the second floor,and looking through saw the body ofMrs. Haggard lying on the bed. Summoning assistance he forced his wayinto the room, and was almost overpowered instantly by escaping gas,with which the room was filled. Agas heater was still lighted, and theroom closed tightly. The appearanceof the body gave every indication ofdeath by-asphyxiation. She had beendead several hours when found. Itwas the opinion of physicians and the.Coroner that Mrs. Haggard, on herreturn from her sister's home, hadlighted the gas stove, which had novent pipe attached, then retired, theroom being tightly closed, and thegas fumes caused her death.Mrs. Haggard was the daughter ofthe late Mr. and Mrs. Jno. Ballenger,her father being a native of Virginia,and her mother, formerly Miss NancyEstes, a native of Clark county. Shewas the widow of James H. Haggard,who for many years conducted a realestate business in this city.

While conditions continue much "as they havebeen during the past few .monthswith the murkiness slowly but surelydisappearing, there are, however, theinevitable uncertainties still cropping out at ' unexpected times andplaces. Nineteen twenty-two is being entered with decks cleared foraction. Even though further adjustments must be completed, conditions to-day are in happy contrastto those that faced us a year ago.UpB-and-down and hard knocksare sometimes a means of growth. Itis earnestly to be hoped that business has profited by the obstacles encountered in the past, and that thelessons will be utilized. Businesscan no longer be frightened by a jsudden jar or shock. This meansprogress.Then, too, we are getting back toa saner method of living and thinking. Speculation in fly-by-nightschemes has lost much of its oldpopularity and in its place is a desire to invest in good securities.Level-headedness is being shown in3 truer appreciation of a dollar'svalue. And of even greater importance is the fact that we have at lastreached the place where we are beginning to realize that no artificial machinery can be invented foravoiding the consequences of overtrading and unwise business policies; that there is no detour on therough and even painful road of readjustment that we have been following. But this is no place to stop. Avital need at present is to aid business in every way possible. We arefaced by a peculiar situation justnow. With the exception of the holiday trade and a few other lines ofindustry, this is naturally the dullperiod of the year, and njany peoplehave made up their minds that nothing is to be expected until later.This is a poor way to get any wherefor it logically follows that if this"later" time fails to bring the expected developments, then'' this samepolicy will be continued.

BasketsandBoxes'For Mfes Holladay'sHomemade CandiesIt very frequently happens thatthe most effective way to accomplish something is to take advantageof the little things even though theymay appear indirect. The day of"easy-money" has passed and intoits shoes has stepped a keen competition for business. To meet thiscompetition the so-called "littlethings" must be watched. Advantage must be taken of every opportunity as it presents itself, and notonly that, but we must go after business. It is true, business is poorand results are hard to get, but itcertainly can do no harm to get organizations back into the old-timemethods of good hard sales efforts.The success of companies and individuals will be measured by theirdetermination and a real honest desire to serve the public.Thrift is one of the master keysthat will open the way to betterbusiness. Thrift and economy areold-fashioned virtues, but coupledwith present day intelligence, a combination is formed that is hard tobeat. As time goes on people are appreciating more and more the necessity for thrift, and it is graduallygaining a larger significance than ithas held for several years.There is need of confidence inpresent day business, and thrift as aconfidence builder stands in thefront rank. From the depositor withhis "nest egg" for a rainy day, tothe large corporation that largelythrough thrift has-adjusted itself topresent conditions, it has no substitute. By thrift is not meant denyingourselves the necessities of life, orcarrying it to the extent of miserliness. We did, however, give riotousspending a fair trial. We found thatthis period of artificial prosperitycould only be temporary, and whatwe have passed through in 1921 wasthe relapse that followed.As we face 1922 nothing will helpmore to carry us through the remainder of the re-adjustment period,nothing will help more toward good,stable business and real prosperity, than a foundation of individual,corporate, municipal and nationalthrift.,Sleeps 6.000 Days.A French statistician estimates thatat the ajje of fifty years the averageman has slept 6,000 days, worked 6,500,walked 800, amused himself 4,000,spent l.,00 outing, and han been 111500 days.Sage Advice."Don't walk de floor worryln' 'boutyob debts."" said Uncle Eben.
