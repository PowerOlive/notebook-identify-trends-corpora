RELIGIOUS.
Rev. Julian McClintock has
just closed a three-weeks' tent meet
ing in a woodland near Danville,
with seventy-eight persons making a
confession of faith.
Bishop Louis W. Burton, of Lex
ington, will conduct the services at
St. Peter's Episcopal church, in this
city, Sunday morning, at ,10:45
o'clock. All are given a cordial invi
tation to attend this service.
October 5 has been designated
as rally day for the B. Y. P. U. in
Southern States. The purposes are
to enroll new members and organize
new unions in churches where only
one, or none exists. The work will
be kept up through the month of Oc
tober. The revival meeting which has
just closed at the Little Rock Chris
tian church, under the auspices of
the pastor, Rev. Ward Russell, was
one of the most interesting held in
that church for years. The musical
service was in charge of Mr. A. L.
Boatright, chorister of the Paris
Christian church. The meeting re
sulted in a total of thirty-three ad
ditions to the church, twenty of
J whom were baptized Monday night.
The annual Kentucky Confer
ence of the Methodist Episcopal
church convened at the Centenary
Methodist church in Shelbyville,
Wednesday, and will continue
throughout Sunday. Bishop Collins
Denny, of Richmond, Va., is presid
ing over the conference, in which
there are 225 accredited delegates.
The conference will meet each morn
ing at 9 o'clock and adjourn at noon.
Evangelistic services will be held(
each afternoon at 3 o'clock and the
different conference boards will hold
their annual meetings when open-air
services will also be conducted.
STOCK, CROP, ETC.
If the initial sales of tobacco are
any indication, the prices for the
weed to be paid the coming season
will be much higher than last winter.
A sale was made on the street at
Frankfort of an entire crop at sixty
cents per pound, leaf, lugs and all.
Good judges estimate that the 1919
tobacco crop of Bourbon county will
be of inferior quality and lacking
in weight, as compared to that of
last year. They also say the crop
will not bring the farmers of Bour
bon county the same revenue as did
the 1918 crop. The loss is estimated
by some of the tobacco men at prac
tically two per cent., while others
place it at twenty-five per cent., fig
uring that the crop is just as good as
last year in quality and as high in
price. m
