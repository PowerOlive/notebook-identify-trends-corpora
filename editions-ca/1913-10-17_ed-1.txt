A representative of the companyfrom Boston has been in the city forseveral days, going over the ground.Early in the week an option on theproperty was secured, and later partof the purchase price of the dam andmill site was paid to the presentowners, Mrs. Mitchell and others. Allthat now remains is for the companyto secure a clear, title to the propertywhich will probably be done the firstpart of the week.The present situation, which has forabout a month confronted the watercompany necessarily prompted immediate action to forestall such-conditions.Nothing of an official naturehas been given out as to the futureplans of the company other than theerection of a large retaining wall ofconcrete at this point, but it is saidother improvements along extensivelines are contemplated.The drouth which has prevailed forabout two months has resulted mpractically all of the water of StonerCreek from which the city derives itswater supply, being consumed.Large forces of men have been employed at various times in trenchingthe stream to run a supply of waterfrom pools that were standing in thebed of the creek, to run the water tothe point in front of the pumpingstation.The present condition of the damat the Paris Milling Company will, itis said, be inadequate to the demandmade upon it to hold enough waterto supply the city, for as soon as thestream reaches a high stage the power will be used to operate the mill,thereby running out the supply andperhaps cause a similar condition tothat which now exists.It is said that the water companywill erect a large dam that will retain enough water to last for an indefinite period which can be run intothe channels of the lower stream atj will, thereby furnishing an inexhaust-iuie suppiy Dotn ror consumers andfire protection.Superintendent Mitchell, under thepresent system of pumping is handling the situation very well, but as yetthere seems to be no relief in sight.The Louisville & Nashville railroad,which has been pumping water fromDoyle's spring to supply the locomotives, a few days ago abandoned thespring when it gave evidence offailing. The temporary pipe line wasextended to a deeper portion of Houston creek and its supply is being supplemented from this source.TOWN OF FORD ISNEARLY DESTROYED.WWWThe little village of Ford, on theKentucky river, in Clark county, wasalmost destroyed by fire at an earlyhour Wednesday morning.

(adv)(Oct.)A congress of physicians in Romehas adopted a resolution, according toa press dispatch, stating that the recent increase of tuberculosis is inpart due to the fashions in women'sdress. --Most Unequal System Ever DevisedanH Mre nf th PrnnrftRRIVfi StatesHave Abolished the Plan Used in jKentucky.The present state constitution ofKentucky provides that "Taxes shallbe uniform on all kinds of property,"and on the surface this seems to beso fair the average thinker can findno fault with it.In practice, however, it has beenfound to be the most unequal tax system ever devised, and most of the progressive states have abolished theplan. .Its inequalities and unfairness maybe seen from the way it discriminatesin certain classes of property and explains why Kentucky seems to haveso little intangible wealth as compared with other states.For instance, cash in savings banksdraws only three per cent interest,gilt-edge bonds pay four percent, realestate notes six per cent, stock insome foreign corporations ten per cent,while the tax on all is the same forstate purposes, but varies for countyand city purposes according to the location.Thus where the income is only 3per cent and the taxes 2y2 per centit leaves the owner only per centinterest, and where the income, is 10per cent and the taxes 2 per centthe interest is 7 per cent. In thisuniform? ,In some counties land is assessedat 30 per cent of its value, in others 50per cent, and in others 70 per cent.The state tax is the same in all thecounties. Is this uniform?If an honest farmer lists his property at its fair value and his unscrupulous neighbor puts a lower valueon his property the former pays morethan his share, while the latter paysless.If the state board of equalizationraises the entire list for that county,the honest man pays on property hedoesn't own, and yet our law is supposed to be uniform.That the personalt" owned by citizens of Kentucky is vastly more thanis listed for taxation is a well-establishedfact; but the tax receipts don'tshow it. In fact, certain classes ofproperty, such as stocks, bonds, notesand cash have almost disappeared fromthe tax rolls, and these evidences ofwealth apparently grow less each year.If the present system is allowed toremain in force, it will result, as it hasin other states, in almost all kinds I ofpersonalty disappearing from the assessors' books, and lands and houseswhich can not be hid or moved willhave to bear the chief burden.It has been so in every state wherethe "general property tax" has beenthe plan on ihich property was taxed,and most of the states have been wiseenough to get rid of such an unequaland unfair system.The Ohio state tax commission, inits 1908 report on the operation of the"general property tax," says:"It is a failure for purposes of revenue or equality. Perhaps not 5 percent of intangible property is listed.It punishes the honest. It rewards thedishonest. It frequently results indouble taxation and lowers the standard of integrity."The entire revenue ci the state ofKentucky is about -17,000,000, whileMichigan, with about the same areaand population, receives $14,000,000from taxes, only a small proportion ofwhich is paid on land.In Pennsylvania there is no statetax on farms or homes.There are 7,000,000 acres of unimproved farm lands in Kentucky andyet vast quantities of farm productshave to be imported.Theie are about twenty-five thousand square miles of coal lands inKentucky, and yet we buy millions oftons of coal from Pennsylvania, WestVirginia, Indiana and Tennessee.Kentucky raises . thirty-eight percent of the tobacco crop of the UnitedStates and manufactures only threeper cent of it. kThese are significant facts and ourpeople should consider them.There may be other causes for ourlack of progress but it is an established fact that no state has everprospered under the general propertytax and it is also known that this deplorable system of taxation has alwaysdriven out capital, retarded development and caused untold losses" in population. The last general assembly passedan act amending the state constitution so as to permit future, legislationon taxation which will go far towardsremedying the evils and it is the dutyof every citizen in the state to votefor the amendment at the Novemberelection. If it is not ratified at thattime it will be impossible to, vote onthe question for another five yearsand it has been delayed too 'long already. It is time for us to wake upand get in line with other prosperousstates. Vote for the constitutionalamendment at the November election.In eleven months this three-ton KisselKar Truck covered in ctctual service4,760 miles at a fuel cost of $1.08 per day.

'TICK CAPACITYTO BE DOUBLEDPlans ForExtension in the LocalYards Now in the Hands ofOfficials Here and WorkWill Soon BeginTWOADDITIONAL SIDETRACKS TO BE BUILTImprovement Necessary to Handle Immense Volume ofFreight HereTo meet the demand for additional track room in the South Yardsof the Louisville & Nashville railroadto accommodate the increase in thefreight traffic that is contemplatedduring the winter, work will begin theearly part of next week upon the extension of the sidetracks of the company to double the present capacityand at the same time the construction of two new tracks will begin.The plans and specifications forthe improvements have been in thehands of the Chief Engineer of thecompany and have just been returnedto this city, after being approved bythe engineer and President Milton H.Smith.The present capacity of each sidetrack in the South Yards is estimatedto be between forty and sixty cars, anumber of them varying in length.Under the new plans the capacity willbe increased from the above fromeighty to one hundred cars. Thetwo new tracks which will be constructed will each have a capacityof about one hundred cars. This improvement it is said will remove anypossibilty of congestion in the yards,which now frequently occurs.Recently the L. & N. purchased astrip of land along the right of wayextending from the crossing at Winchester street on the east side to theround house. The property was owned by negroes in the suburb of Claysville facing on the right of way ofway of the company f was securedeither by purchase or exchange, inmany instances the company erectingcomfortable residences on a portionof the property acquired from theGriffith estate and upon which thefirst improvements in the freight yardwere made.The underpass leading from Fourteenth street to Claysville, whichwhen first constructed accommodatedabout four tracks, has been doubledand the work has been completed forabout six weeks. Grading the roadway has been in progress and this isabout completed.The late improvements of the company indicate that it is contemplating a large increase in the freighttraffic as a result of the extensioni into the coal fields of Kentucky andwill serve to allay the report in circulation quite frequently that thecompany is contemplating movingthe yards to another point on the division.

Tolman, "King of Shy-locks," was sentenced to six months'in prison by Justices Zeller, Forakerand Collins in the Special SessionsCourt in New York a few days ago.He was charged with charging a usarious rate of interest to a clerk on a?10 loan.Tolman is known as the "King ofLoan Sharks" throughout the UnitedStates. He own and operates 56 offices in cities all. over the country.Scores of times his girl managershave been arrested and fined, butnever before, except a few weeks agoin Trenton, N. J., when he was convicted of keeping a disorderly house,has he ever been convicted personally of carrying on this line of business. In passing sentence, Justice Zellersaid: "I have no sympathy for thisman who has been engaged in thisunspeakable business. Such a manis a disgrace to the community. Themethods by which he tried to coverup his usurious transactions, underthe guise of buying commercial paper, were nothing but a miserablesubterfuge to evade the laws of thisState. I have .less feeling for himthan he had for the poor devil, fromwhom he had been collecting $1.25 aweek for 12 weeks on a $10 loan. Thei sentence of the Court is that you shallbe imprisoned in the penitentiary forsix months. You are the most con-temptible usurer in your contemptible business. To extract $15 from apoor man for a loan of $10 for 12weeks is like squeezing blood out ofmoney. I trust that such sharks asyou will take warning that the Courtshave now found a way to protect thepoor from you and your kind."The sentence was a terrible shock toTolman, who had anticipated a fineat the most. The hole question of hisguilt hinged about whether or not hepersoually had negotiated the loanwith Shick. Three of Tolman's women clerks declared Shick had nottalked with their employer, but theirevidence was unsatisfactory and contradictory. The case against Tolmanwas prosecuted in the Tombs PoliceCourt by Assistant District AttorneyDeual, who obtained the warrant forhis arrest on Shick's complaint amonth or more ago. His arrest tookplace the day after he had been released by the Trenton Court on apromise never again to engage in thebusiness in the United States underthreat of being brought back to NewJersey and .sentenced to three yearsin the penitentiary.mFeel Bully!

The marriagewag the result of a courtship whichentends several years back, whenboth the bride and groom were schoolchildren and was celebrated undermost unusual circumstances.Two years ago Mr. Romanowitz accepted a position with a Jarge engineering firm in Alameda, Cal., wherehe has since been located, and MissRitchie became a teacher in theschool from which both had graduated. Two weeks ago she becamevery ill with an attack of scarletfever, and her life was dispaired of.Immediately upon receiving a telegram of her serious illness Romanowitz left for a hurried trip across thecontinent to be at the bedside of hissweetheart, who was then thought tobe dying. Upon his arrival in Ludlowlittle hope was held out for her recovery, and he insisted upon claim;ing her as his wife.The dispirited young man, togetherwith Rev. C. H. White, pastor of thePresbyterian Church, and the youngwoman's mother entered the sickchamber, and with her head proppedup by pillows held by gloving handsthe nuptial knot was tied. Her condition did not seem to grow worse,and in the evening a decided improvement was noticed, which continued steadily, her lover constantlyby her side, watching her condition-.She was pronounced to be on the roadto complete recovery. However, fatedecreed that the lovers should partagain, when the young groom received an urgent call'to return toCalifornia, being assured of the improved condition of his bride he leftfor Alameda, to be followed by hiswife as soon as she is sufficientlyconvalescent to travel.FALLING HAIR MEANSDANDRUFF IS ACTIVE.Save Your Hair!

Upon the statements of the men two of the allegedplotters were arrested in New Yorkcharged with setting off a bomb infront of an East Side tenement houselast September. The accused arePietro Gambronio and Diego Leventino. Leventino was taken to Hackensack, and, according to Deputy PoliceCommissioner Dougherty, was idenitfied by the prisoners there as thehead of a gang of black-hand bombexploders operating in New- York andvicinity.One of the prisoners is declared tohave betrayed the gang when part ofhis reward for firing off a bomb washeld back.The confession of the men inHackensack led to further arrests,two being apprehended on the chargeof extortion, and two others as counterfeiters. Captain Henry, of theUnited States Secret Service, tookcharge of the alleged counterfeitersand after a brief investigation oneman was arrested in Broklyn and seven in Troy, N.

Five dollar note on theIrving National Bank, of that city,and one dollar bills have been manufactured by members of the gang inTroy and in Hackensack, accordingto Henry's discovery.Confessions obtained, according toDougherty, implicates about forty foreigners. Two alleged principals hesaid never set off bombs themselves,but delegated the work to subordinates. The reasons given for the outragesare four: Extortion, revenge, intimidation (as in the case of strikes)and business rivalry.
