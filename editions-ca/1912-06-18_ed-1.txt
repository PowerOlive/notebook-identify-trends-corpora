Stout convened the"June term of the Bourbon CircuitCourt yesterday morning. While.Judge Stout came to Paris last Mon-:day to hold court, an adjournment wa&taken pending tlie action of the Court,of ADpeals regarding the cunstitutionality.of the law enacted at the recentterm of the Legislature, creating aseparate district of the county oiFranklin, and when the count's decision knocked out the new district he.came here with a view of hearingequity cases.The petit and grand jurors were excused until yesterday morning, when.,the grand jury was selected. Coir.Robt. 13. Franklin, Commonwealth'"Attorney, arrived yesterday from hishome in Frankfort to look after theinterests of the Comonwp.alth at thpresent term of court.The call of the panel summoned forservice on the grand jury, resulted in.the following being selected :Wm. Meteer, James D. McCIintockSweeney Isgrig, Current Cunninghams.John G. Towles, J. G. Ockerman, VV-.VV. Hall, J. T. Hagan.Henry Gaitskill,C. V. Higgins, A.: D. Leach, AarorrSmedlpy. Mr. Towles was designatedas foreman of the body.Judge Stout delivered the oath t&Shriff A. S. Thompson and his depisties, VV.F Talbott, J. 0. Marshall an&Ernest Martin and charged the grand,jury briefly concerning the duties be?fore them. ;:-Judge Stout said that he realized theimportance of a number of those composing the grand jury to be at homeengaging in their labors on the farroand for that reason .he" would make hischarge as brief as 'possible, and outlined the duties they were expected tonerform.He said that Bourbon county enjoyedtne distinction of being, a peaceable!and lawabiding county, and that reputation was due to the efforts of proceeding juries in the ne.rformance oftheir duties. But with all the effortsof those emoowered to uphold the layand order of the community, there wasbound to. exist a certain lawless element. He said that in other StatesKentucky held a very unenviable'repatation which was gained through thelawlessness of practically one sectionof the State, due -to the laxity of thelaw in that section and the inefficiencyof grand juries.Without delivering an extensivecharge Judge Stout referred to themisdemeanors, violations of the liquorlaw and gambling, carryjng;concealedweauons, and reterreo orieny to. xnefish "and game laws which he saidshould be rigidly enforced to preerve-the game of the State.The call of the petit jury was made,and out of a panel of thirty-six, onlythirty appeared. Of this number twowere excused and the remainingeleven qualified for service. JudgeStout ordered Snother panel to fili curthe two juries, which was followed 15ya call of the Commonwealth docket.The case of the Commonwealth vs.Richard Henson will probably be thefirst case taken up."WE KNOW HOW4NO "FATTED CALF" for theProdigal Son, but we do offercomforjt and satisfaction -to theprodigal clothes-buyer.11 nose wnorepast for bothhave spent riotously ia theBLUE RIBBON PLOUR5-Sb Sack : .

The Democratic Housa voted it out of existence,and a coalition of progressive Republicans and Democrats in the Senate hassustained the House.Coal Barons Greedy.Preparations are being made to add$15,000,000 to the nation's coal bill thisI winter. Each one ot us must con-tribute our pro rata to the fortunes ofj the coal barons. There isno reason or'justice for the increase, except thattne millionaire coal Kings want tnemoney and are in a positionto makethe people either "come across" orfreeze.The coal operators, who have beenforced to grant the miners an increasein wages, which they!say will mean'anaddtional cost of 5,000,000 in labor,are goiug to force the consumer to pay1 a sufficiently high price for coal toenable them to stand this increase,along with an additional extortion of810,000,000, which will be clear profitto the trust. Thus, for every dollar inincreased prices that the coal operatorspropose to colIectthis winter for theminers, they have decided to extorttwo dollars for themselves. All ushelpless consumers have to do is to paythe bill. Always, always, it is theconsumer who pays the bill.Milking the Country Banks.Manager Scherer, of the New YorkClearing House, testified to manythings before the Money Trust investigating committee that will cause thecountry banks to sit up and takenotice.The clearing house was shown to becomposed of fify New York banks. Nobank wih a capital stock amounting toless than $1,000,000 is eligible tomembership.Mr. bcherer's testimony revealed asystem by which the New York banksguuge the country banks and theirclients out of millions,tie sain mat it cost seven cents per$1,000 to collect the checks of countrybanks. The Clearing House, he said,collects 70 cents per $1,000, or tentimes the real cost.?ffections is about $80,000. It amountsI . jliic civcidKC biiaiuc uci uay iui luj-to about $50,000,000 a year. From thisfleecing process the fifty banks comprising the clearing house associationextorted sufficient tribute from thecountry bankers last year to enableeach of the fifty New York banks topay an eight'per.cent dividend on'theircapital stock.Thus it becomes apparent to evaryfair-minded person why the New Yorkbanks and financial magnates so bitterly opposed the investigation by Congress of the Money Trust.Eat the Fests."Eat sparrows; when boned. broil-Jed,' buttered and served on toast theyare as fine as quail.

S " ."Why I Bred the American SaddleHorse.(By W. E. Still well.)I was born to love a horse, and atthe age" of five years I ownpd fifteei.stick' horses. One was a fine showborse, 'with an arched grapevine nccland a Jeatherwood tail. When nimyears old 1 was employed by Dr. W.H Smith, of Leesville. Ind. to takehim to and from the B. & 0. S. W.R. R. , - , m iHe always rode a good saddle horse,and it was then that my heart antmind became foird of the saddle horse.They possess great beauty, they arcthe finest 1 o.ses living, with a clean,bony, well-tapered head. His neckand arch of pride and grace, a splashof sDirit in liis face, a tail like that ofa squrirrel, that is a wonder of theWorld, , and when in action it is pleasins to the eye, and the sound of gaitsis music to the ear, and his wonderfulgreatness fills the soul with a liftingpower. There, is no machine that cmthe place of an intelligent horse;ithey are a companion to us. Traveler-was a comoanion to General Lee andhis soldiers. His great courage andfaithful duties, where others failed inthe hardships of war, won the heartsof the soldiers, and when he came intocamp, lor on the field of battle, hebrought sunshine to the hearts of thebrave men, and they cheered him, asthey did his kind master, General Lee.Their Value as a Business Horse.They far excel as a business horse.They are at ease under the saddle ;while not so swift in harness as kthetrotter, they make up in beauty andconformation. As a farm horse theyareiactive and quick to learn. While,they lack in weight, they make up insteD fand endurance. It is upon thegentle saddle horse that our greathorsemen and women take their firstlessons. yThe Greatest Show Horse Thesaddle horse has forged to the front asAmerica's greatest show horse. Theycan win more money and show in morerings than any other horse ; such as thefive-gaited ring, walk trot and canter,combined, model, fine harness ring,heavy harness, roadster, breeders,class, chargers, cavalry, jumpers,champion bhorse any reed. Theseclasses have been won by saddie horses,-with strong competition by otherbreeds. Saddle horse ,day in Kentucky at the fair is the banner day."When the Bluegrass Fair at Lexington, Ky.. hung up $1,000 for the bestsaddle stallion, mare, or gelding, itproyed a" great day. The trains andtrolleys groaned with their loads ofhumanity, and the public roads werelined with vehicles of every drisiption. It was a great day of saddlehorse history. Again, last year, at theBluegrass Fair, when fifty-one coltsbattled for uthe $1,800 stake in theXJolt Futurity, it shows that interest isgrowing, and that its originator. Mr.H. J. Krum, is a leader in the saddleaild W h?Se interests, When, the,hig $6,000 California Saddle Stake fills,"we will see peaches and creamchampions. Hurrah for Kentucky! m Ihope she can win.Their Value as a Money Producer.AVhen you can sell a weanling filly for$800 and win $700 in premiums, andget $1,000 worth ot pleasure, thatmeans $2,500 for a saddle filly sixmonths old. When you sell a yearlingfor $1,500 it makes your bank bookshine, and when you sell a three-year-oldfor $5,000 it makes it sparkle.Thislhas been done in the great Bluegrass Nursery, where the championsare bred. Garrett Bros, refused $5,000for Black Squirrel when eighten yearsold. Seven thousand dollars was refused for'Dandy Jim. Rex McDonaldsold for $5,000. Twelve thousand dollars was refused for Bourbon King.Dinah o the Lea, a great-granddaughterof my horse, Pat Washington, soldas a three-year-old for $5,000. Poetryof Motion is the greatest show horseliving. He won four champonships at.New York, won seven championshipsat Louisville, Ky. He was shown sixyears at all the big shows, without asingle defeat, and is still show horse.Edna Mae comes next, winning $14,000in cash, S6.000 in silver. She sold for$7,000, which equals $27,000. Kentucky's Choice won $3,267 last year,and his last sale was $7,450. Mr. JohnSmiley won $1,632 on Bourbon Princeand others last year"A Pleasure HGrse Riding horsebackis the most pleasureable Exercise forthe mudern man or woman. There isnothing else like it. It is invigoratingand entertaining. It brings everypart, every muscle, mind and soul intoaction. Breathing more fully thebeams of sunlight,, and the beauty ofnature, the song of the birds, thehouh of the trees, the breeze ofHeaven, in the music that rests thehrain, and binds the affection of horseand rider. Every bpy and girl shouldlearn horseback riding. The mind andbody grows stronger, the years of lifegrow longer, and those who ride tothose, who pride in being kind to theAmerican saddle horse.It is now well known that not morethan one case of rheumatism requiresany internal treatment whatever.

The love-vine is a relatedspecies, but is commonly found onolant3 of little value, growing cn wetland. -These plants have no true leaves andare not weedsin the proper sense, buoarasites, deriving all their nourishment from plants of other sorts. Theclover-inifesting speices becomes extremely destructive at times, and sometimes damages a planting so severelyas to compel the owner to plow it up.Fortunately, it does not attack mostother Dlants and hence, even if soil becomes thickly sown with us seeos,will still produce crops of other sorts,Yet it is sometime a scurce'of less andannoyance to the farmer to give up atract of land for clover, or altala, because of the presence of the seeds ofdodder in the soil, and the questionis often asked; "What can I do to getrid of it?"Very littie can be done once soil isthickly sown with the seeds ex.ceptusing the land for other crops not subject to attack and waiting until theseeds have lost their vitality. Justhow long this will be necessary has notbeen determined but it would rrihablybe a good many years judging by whatwe know of the persistence ot otherseeds.It is a matter of the utmost importance therefore to prevent land becoming infested with the pest and heresomething can be done. The seedshave been sown in large numbers inKentucky with clover and alfalfa seedOur work of inspecting the field seedssold in the market showed originallythat a large proportion of both theclover and alfalfa seeds containeddodder seeds. At one time screeningscontaining ddodder and otehr weedseeds were imported to this countryfrom Europe and were mixed with theseedssoldlo our farmers. This factaccounts for'the general presence ofdodderseedsamongclover and alfalfaseeds when we began Jour work. Thepest was about that time so thicklysown over the State that at present oneis liable to find its seeds in any homegrown clover or alfalfaseed offered forsale. To avoid sowing the seeds farmers'shouldlfirst acquaint themselveswith' their appearance and to do this itis only necessary to buy a tripod magnifier costing about fifty cents, spreada sample of.clover or alfalfa seeds ona sheet of white paper and separate allforeign seeds. Dodder seeds mav berecognized py the. fact that they" aresmaller than the average well maturedclover and alfalfaseeds, measuring butabout 0.04 inehjrf diameter, whereasgood clover seed should measure about0.07 inch in lengthand alfalfa 0.08 or0.09 inch. Seeds of the pest are nearly spherical, though sometimes slightly ;iujgieujjwui&fci-v tun incaauic ul tucseed against another in the seed capsule. The surface is dull and smooth,the color, pale gray, or light brownishgray. Seeds of the field dodder or lovevine, sometimes found with cloverseeds average a little larger than clover dodder seeds and thus are not soeasily serened out with the seives used jby seedsmen. Standard seives are inuse, however, that will 'remove most, Ior all clover dodder seeds, and the !presence of this doddei seed in samplesis to be looked upon as condemning thestock from which it was taken. Noman working for the good of the agriculture of hps country will knowinglyput such seeds on tne market. iWhen farmers or seedsmen are un-able to decide for themselves aboutthe presence of dodder seeds, samples .should be sent to the Experiment iStation at Lexington, where they will Ibe examined free of c'large. IFarmers can help greatly in reduc-1ing the injuries of dodder, not only by Irefusing to buy field seeds in which !are dodder seeas. but by rerraningfrom harvesting clover seeds of infested fields. When dodder is prevalent inclover or alafifa it is sometimes wiseto cut the cron before the dodder seedsare ripe, or else plow the whoje growthunder and put the land in some other'crop. A few patches of dodder in afield may sometimes be completelyeradicated by using crude carbolic acidfreely. This kills plants of all sortsfor a lime, but in one instance ofslight infestation it was made use ofto accomplish the purpose veryeffectively on the Experiment Farm.Paper From Cotton Stalks.Cotton stalks, it is thought, . maybe used for the manufacture paper.

("Kiny")McNamara, charged with the murderof former Parisian Jacob S. Keller: inLexington, was arrested' Friday inLouisville by Sheriff Dan W. Scott, ofFayette county.The arrest of McNamara draws thecurtain on one of the most cold-bloodedcrimes ever committed in Lexington.Id February, 1899, McNamara shotKeller, who was the Q. & G. ticketagent in Lexington, at the corner ofMain and Limestone streets, and fromthe effect of his injuries he died athospital a short time afterward.McjNamara, who naa oeen released onbond, made his escape shortly afterthe death of Keller, and has since beenat large. His capture has been reported several times, but each time theprisoner under arrebt proved to be thewrong man.McNamara was taken into custodyat tne fceeioacn Hotel -as he wasentering the elevator, by Sheriff Scott.and returned to Lexington, where heis now confined in the county jail. Hiscapture was effected through inforrnation gaind by the'Lexington officialsfrom a female detective-in Louisvillewho had been working on the case. Itis said that McNamara had.been hidingin Louisville for several years.Jacob S.
