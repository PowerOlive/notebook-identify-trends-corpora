with the following obituary of Mr.
Roebuck:
"Charles D Roebuck, aged '43
years, died last Tuesday morning,, at
his home at Van Wert, of pneumonia.
"He was taken ill on New Year's
day, and his attack baffled the best
medical assistance, resulting fatally.
"Deceased with his family had re
sided in Van Wert during the past
year, moving there fr6m Rockford,
and was employed as train dispatcher
of the C. N. railroad.
"Besides his wife, who was for

a son-in-law, a brother, and a niece
