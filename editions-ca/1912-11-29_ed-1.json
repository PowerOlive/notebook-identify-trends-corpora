Hart Had Local Connections
George M. Hart, deputy sheriff ofj
Clark county, who was killed last Sun-
dav nieht at Winchester by a gang of
negroes, was one of the most promi
nent fraternal men of that city, be
sdies beingtone of the most popular
men of the county.
He was a son of Josiah T. Hart, of
Clarke ounty, and a grand nephew of
Joel T. Hart, the famous sculptor,
who before he achieved a world wide
fame, was a resident of Little Rock,
this county. His wife was Miss Theo
dosia Lewis and her father, Mr. Wm.
Lewis, ofjashville. Tenn., i3 a cousin
of lion. H. C. Howard, of Paris,
United States Minister to Peru.
The funeral of Mr. Hart was held at
Winchester Tuesdav afternoor., and
was laigely attended.
A dispatch from Charleston, W. Vr.,
yesterday savs: ' Chief nt Pol'ue
Woodson McCoif', of Winchester, Kv.,
arrived here to::i.riL aid will leave for
Kentucky tomorrow with two m n who
are believed to have had a hand in the
murder of Deputy Sh l iff Geo. m.
Hart, of Clark county, on the streets
of Winchester Sundav night. Chief
McCord will probablv take his prison
ers to Lexington, Ky. for safekeeping,
as public indignation at the time of
t the killing of Hart was high and it is
not believed it would be safe to take
the prisoners back to Winchester.
"ihe prisoners arrested here gave
the names of John Brooks and Joseph
Wilson, but their description fits tnat
ot two of the men who are believed to
have killed Hart. These men, all ne
groes, disappeared from Winchester
thenight of the killing and after a
fight with a posse have not been seen
since."

26 tf PARIS BOOK CU.
"FRECKLES"
Neil Twomeys dramatization of Gene
Stratton-Porter's widely read story.
"Freckles," which will be the attrac
tion at the Paris Grand tomorrow
night is considered a fascinating
story of Indiana's great swamp coun
try, known as "The Limberlusr." The
book has had more than a million
readers, and "Freckles," the drama,
is creating a furore. The fact that a
book contains vial requisites for dram
atization, assures us that ,the play i3
of more interest than the story. be
cause the characters are living crea
tions, and their dialogue life, not fic
tion. Those who have read "Freckles."
will understand the possibilities for a
drama of far more than ordinary ac
tion, and atmosphere. There is unlim
ite 1 scope for the scene painter, the
electrician and the stage mechanic,
who have availed themselves of the od
portunity offered, and in these fea
tures the production is said to be of
surpassing magnificence.
The dramatist ; in adapting "Frec
kles" for the stage has keDt strictly
to the text of the book. The familiar
character of Freckles, a nameless waif
when the story opens, and his develop
ment and manliness in the way in
which he takes hold of life. The na
ture friendships he forms in the great
Limberlost swamp, the charm of his
engaging nersonality and his love
story with "The Angel," his various
exploits with the timber thieves, are
all intense and virilistic scenes in the
play. Nothing is left to imagination.
It is proving the success of the season
everywhere it is being played.

One o! Hart's Slayers Caught.
Jim Brown, alias "Shine," one of
the alleged murderers of Deputy Sher-
i iff George M. Hart, of Winchester,
last Sunday night, was arrasted at
Renick Station, three miles from Win
chester, on the Louisville and Nash
ville, early yesterday morning. The
negro was taken into custody" at the
store of Luther Reeves at Renick.
At an early hour yesterday morning
Brown put in his appearance at the
store. He seemed to be suffering in
tensely from (the cold and from the left
hand two hngers were missing. Sever
al men around the store questioned
the i epro and he told of falling from
a freight train sustaining tht injury.
He gave all appearance of suffering
intensely from the wound on the hand,
and a closer examination revealed a
jagged bullet wound in the breast,
evidently inflicted in the pitched bat
tle which ensued whpn ihe posse pur
suing the fleeing negrots came upon
them on the VanMeter pike Sunday
night.
The appearance of the negro led
Reeves to believe that he was one of
the negroes wanted for the murder
and he telephoned to Winchester for
an officer. Two members of the police
department went to tne store, where
they placed the r.egro under arrest.
At first he denied having any know
ledge of the shooting but latei admit
ted that he was with the gang that
shot down the deputy sheriff but de
clared he did not do the shooting. He
said that when the officer came upon
him he said "Well, I've got you
'Shine,' " and no sooner had he spoken
than one of the negroes with him fired
the two shots which caused the death
of the officer.
Since the night of the shooting the
negro has been in hiding in a corn
shock near Kenick. His wounds had
no attention and durinc the time he
had nothing to eat. He had suffered
intensely from the cold and the wound
in hi breast from all appearances
looked to be very dangerous.
The police of Winchester are of the
opinoin that they have the man who
committed the crime
Graves Marked.
So far as the earnest and careful
search by one of their own leaders on
the field of battle can assure, every
Confederate soldier and sailor who
died in a Northern prison and was bur
ied nearby now lies beneath a head
stone or a monument of marble. Gen.
J. H. Berry, exSenator from Arkan
sas, the only surviving member of the
committee intrusted by Congress with
this task has juat reported the comple
tion of his woik to the Secretary of
War.
