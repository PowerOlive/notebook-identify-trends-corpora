The fJlover Burglar
The burglar who does several jobs
and elndes the officers of the law i a
keen observer a man of forethought
and one whose exeoutive ability is un
questioned Houses are not entered be-
sional thief without an investigation
When the skillful burglar is to do a
job he studies the habits of the resi
dent or proprietor In a case in Troy a
few years ago a jewelry store was rob
Detectives were placed on the case and
named the thieves by the method em
ployed in gettiug into the store and
subsequently the thieves were convicted
Certain burglars always enter a cellar
and come up through stairs floor or
trapdoors Others have skeleton keys
Others go above and come down stairs
Some break in rear and others front
doors In the robbery above referred to
the two thieves had been in Troy three
successive Saturday nights They had
fastened a silk thread on all entrances
in such a way that if any one entered
or left the store the thread would be
broken Thus the burglars learned that
the proprietor and clerks did not visit
the store after closing Saturday night
until Sunday The fourth Saturday
night they cracked the safe Except
for their methodical way of entering
A Disgusted Hero
The story of Sergeant Walker who
was kept- prisoner for six weeks by the
Afridis and was court martialed for
being absent without leave reminds
me of an Indian tale of 1757 when a
man Strahau by name
captured almost single handed one of
the torts on the Hoogly The fort
which was strongly situated was in
vested by the admiral and Strahan
during the time of midday repose wan
dered off on his own in its direction
Gaining the walls without discovery
he took it into his head to scale a breach
made by the cannon of the ships and
on reaching the platform he flourished
his cutlass and fired his pistol at the
uiggurs shouting The place is
mine
who had straggled out of camp and
heard his huzzas The enemy unpre
pared from this ill timed attack and
fearing further invaders fled from the
fort upon the opposite side leaving 20
cannon and a large store of ammuni
tion Much to Strahan s surprise he
was lectured by the admiral for his
breach of discipline and he was dis
missed with hints of future punish
ment Well said Strahan if Im
flogged for this here action Im d d
if I ever takes another fort as long as I
lives London Sketch

Whats the matter I asked sleep

friend leaped to his feet once more ex
claiming
Theres a rattler here sures fate
and youd better get up I believe hes
under my coat
It was queer that I couldnt hear it if
it was so near I cautiously extended
my hand feeling along the ground
Yes I know it was a foolish thing to
do but we dont always stop to think
Suddenly I burst out laughing
Yes I said there is a rattler
