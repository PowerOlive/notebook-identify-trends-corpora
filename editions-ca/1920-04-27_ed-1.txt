There is only one way tocure catarrhal deafness, and that isby a constitutional remedy. Catarrhal Deafness is caused by an inflamedcondition of the mucous lining ofEustachian Tube. When this tubeis inflamed you have a rumblingsound or imperfect hearing, andwhen it is entirely closed, deafnessis the result. Unless the inflammation can be reduced and this tuberestored to its normal condition,hearing will be destroyed forever.Many cases of deafness are causedby catarrh, which is an inflamedcondition of the mucous surfaces.Hall's Catarrh Medicine acts thruthe blood on the mucous surfaces ofthe system.We will give One Hundred Dollars for any case of Catarrhal Medicine.

Itmay be all right in some sections,but here in Paris it will do harminstead of good.As soon as the manufacturers ofoveralls sees that it is popular theywill raise the price and get up aplea of a shortage of material. Infact, we understand that they arealready playing this game, and it iour honest oelief that the wholeaffair is a cunningly-devised schemeof the rianufacturers themselves.We have here in Paris a class ofpien who have to wear overalls intheir daily work. It doesn't seemfair just for the sake of what is undoubtedly a fad, to raise the price ofoveralls and make this class of citizens pay two or three pi ices forthem.If the club idea is carried, out itwill cause another investigation byCongress and that will cost the taxpayers at least a million dollars.When it is aU summed up, "JonestwII pay the freight."-o"TTTF.

"And then when I had themfuenza over a year ago it left meso weak arid miserable that I almostsuffered a complete breakdown. Iwas unable to even sweep the floor,for I would give out completely andone to keep up the house it hurtwhen my husband had' to get someme so that I almost gave up heart.My digestion was so bad that Ii early lost my appetite, a-nd what Idid eat bloated me up with gas andcaused me to suffer agonies frompains in my stomach. Dizzy, nauseating spells would come over mef-ucdenlv and I would have to liedown wherever I happened to be. Iwas so weak and short-winded thatI could not walk a full block without having to stop and rest. I was50 -nervous that for past two years Ididn't know what it was to get agood night's sleep. In fact, I hadfallen off in weight, and was insuch a miserable condition that Ijust hate to thirfk what a wreck Iwas and can hardly understand howI held out as long as I did."About a month ago my husbandcame home with a bottle of Tanlacand said he had been hearing somuch about it that he wanted me totry it. I began to improve rightaway and now, although I havetaken only three bottles, I feel thatI have been made over into a newweman. I eat just anything Iwant and am never troubled afterwards yin the least. Those dizzy,rauseating spells don't bother meany more and I am doing all my"h -use-work by nryself. The ;nerv-f asness has all left me and I amnew enjoying sound, restful sleepevery night. Already I have gainedp.ght pounds in weight and have-ore strength and energy than 1have had in six years. I am just sohappy over what Tanlac has donefcr me that I want to tell otherbuffering people about this medicine." Tanlac is sold in Paris at PeoplesFkarmacy.
