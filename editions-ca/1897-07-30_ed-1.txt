Inter OceanA CASE IN EQUITYkY FRANCIS LYNDECopyright 1895 by J B Lippincott CoVII ContinuedWhen one begins to argue with hisconscience it is a foreordained conclusion that conscience will get the worstof it Lest Philip should be set down asa poor figure of a man prone to do weakthings as are the sparks to fly upwardlet it be said that he did only whatseemed at the time to be good andright Love or what passes for love isnot always accountable to logic or tocommon sense it may perhaps be theadopted child of the intellect but it isbegotten and nurtured b the sensesPropinquity contact daily associationthe farness of one object and the nearness of another all these influenceswere in Thorndykes case opposed towhat was unconsciously becoming dayby day more of an abstraction hisfealty to Helen And besides whenone firmly believes he has made hissalaam to the king ofterrors the conviction may so distort tlie mental andmoral vision as to make one practicallycolor blindHalf an hour after Elsie and Philiphad disappeared in the forest Protheroerode up to the gate with a packet ofletters for Thornd3Tke When helearned that the invalid and Elsie wereon the mountain together he seemedquite as anxious to get away from thefarmhouse as he had just been to reachit On the way back to town he hadanother impatient argument with himself coming out of it as on a former occasion with a certain measure of philosophical resignation for which he paidrather dearly in the coin of disappointedhopesvniTHE HERMIT OF THE -POCKETWait a minute and Ill help yousaid Philip bursting his way through atangle of briers toward Elsie who stoodat the foot of a miniature cliff the lastin the series guarding the summitFor answer she sprang lightly to aprojecting ledge balanced herself anddarted up the face of the rock withoutappearing to touch it There was agreat rhododendron at the top and herlaughing face was framed against thebackground of glowing color as shecalled down to himIm waiting shant I give you ahandPhilip said no climbing laboriouslyafter her Half way up he slipped andslid back to the bottom when he triedagain she threw herself down upon theflat top of the rock grasped his wristsjust as he was losing his hold for thesecond time and pulled him to a firmfooting beside her It was nothing buta bit of spontaneous helpfulness butnone the less the incident served to reopen the question which Philip had justdismissed He sat down at her feet torecover his breath while she gathered ahandful of the rhododendronsDid it tire you she askedNo not very much I wasnt thinkingof that I was trying to bring myselfto the point of telling you somethingthat yoif ought to knowIs it about yourselfYesShe sat down beside him to arrangethe flowers I am listening she saidencouraginglyThe opportunitj had come butThorndyke trifled with it Do youknow wh I came to Alabama he beganWhy yes it was on account of yourhealth wasnt itIt was but did you know that myease is quite hopelessI knew you thought it soI still think so the doctor as goodns told me it was and yet do youknow that just now I feel that undersome circumstances I might win myvyay back to health and strength-againThats the way you ought to feel allits more than half the battleThorndyke remembered ProtheroesAvords and wondered if he had repeatedthem to Elsie I suppose I shouldbutI cant It was just as you lifted meover the edge of the rock it seemed as- if you gave me a new hold upon life outofcyour abundance Queer wasnt itThis was not at all what he had begunto say but the words chose themselvesIts astonishing wJhat a retrospectivefield the mind -will cover at a pinchisnt it Now in that half second whileyou were helping me I got a telescopicglimpse of my whole life and its always been thesame way some one haspulled me up over the hard places beforeI could even try to do for myself Andits taken the color out of everything- there has never been anything leftworth living and fighting for if thereIrad been I might be able to make someishow of resistance nowf--Tin -afraid I dont quite understandyou she said I thought everybody1ad something to live forI presume most people have and inmy own case the uncharitable might saysomething about sour grapes Thatwouldnt bo true though it wasntuntil I knew I couldnt live that I caredjiiuch about it And there is every reason to suppose that with the fear ofdeath removed life would go back againto the same old dreary round and bemore undesirable than everShe rose and fastened the bunch ofrhododendrons in- her belt Do youreally mean to say that you have no reason for wanting to live Would nobodybe sorry if you diedThorndyke killed his opportunitywith oneblow Yes there may besome who would be sorry perhaps youwould care a little But that is entirelya different matter Im not good enoughto want to live to oblige my friends norbad enough to want to die to spite themLets go and find the Pocket you weretelling meTaboutIt is an open question as to how literally the most sincere person an affordto be taken in a conversation whichbears upon his own personality Doubtless Philip meant to say what was inhim at the time nevertheless repentance came afterward and with it moregood intentions While Philip the selfestimated was as little like Philip thereal as might be yet there was undeniably an accusing conscience whichthe self known Philip sought to muzzlewith the fiction that the afternoon wasstill young Unfortunately howeveropportunities for the saying of reluctantthings do not grow upon every busheven upon a sequestered mountain topand Philips conscience was still unappeased when an hour beyond the rhododendron they came out upon the rimof a crater like valley cutting a deepgash in the mountain It was ellipticalin shape with wooded sides slantingdown from the base of the cliff line toa small cornfield in the center but therewas no sign of a house nor of any roadleading down from the level of theplateau A clear stream gushing frombeneath a flat bowlder at the foot of thesouthern slope splashed riotouslythrough the length of the valley to varnish again into the mouth of a lowbrowed cave at the base of the northerncliffThe happy valley of Rasselas withthe inhabitants left out said Thornetyke Is this the PocketYes the Devils Pocket the mountaineers call itWhy devils asked PhilipIm sure I dont know father saysits because some people like to namethings after their patron saintThats a quaint idea but the namefits rather belter in this case than itusually does There is always something suggestive of the weird and uncanny in a valley that has no visible outlet How docs the man who hoes thatcorn ever get down to itOh there are several wajs to getdown though r xmt -very man v peopleknow them -- -v -I suppose you know some of themcant we explore itI think wed better not try its getting late and vWho was that interrupted Thorndyke pointing toward a great bowlderstanding like a sentinel over the cornfieldI didnt see anybody replied Elsielooking troubledBut Im sure I did while ypu werespeaking I caught aglimpse of si mans1 adding in the shadow of that rockjust beyond the stream He looked likeanother Rip Van Winkle Philipstopped and sent his memory back overthe last few days in search of somethingI know now he went on I was sureId seen him before He was in the garden with your father one morning whenI came downstairs and he ran awaywhen he saw me Who is heI cant tell you its his secret and nvyfathers I shouldnt have brought youhere when I might have known youdask questions Will you forgive me andpromise you wont say anything aboutwhat youve seenThat is very feminine to ask forgiveness and exact a promise all in onebreath but Ill overlook it this timeand promise to be as dumb as an 03sterOnly I wish you would tell me abouthim youve aroused my curiosity untilI shant be able to sleep to nightElsie shook her head doubtfully 1mustnt tell anybody I should neverforgive myself if any harm came to himthrough meBut I dont understand I hope youdont think that Id hurt anv friend ofyours On the contrary Id be glad tohelp him if he needs helpOh he docs ho needs friends bomuch Hes a poor lonely old manand hes afraid of everybody I canteven make him understand that MrProtheroe wouldnt hurt himWhoever first pointed the sarcasmwhich has resulted in turning a proverbupon feminine curiosity knew notwhereof he spake As compared withthe greed for enlightenment which assails the masculine mind at the barescent of a mjstery the curiosity ofwoman is but a sedative Philip wasno exception to the rule governing- hissex and the pathos in Elsies voice wasbecoming quite irresistibleTell me about him heurged Illpromise anything you can ask in thewaj of secrecy and discretion azilas she still hesitated he did not scruplenot because she Ava afraid to trustThorndyke but rather for the reasonthat the daughter of James Duncancould not well help inheriting something of his cautious habit At lengthshe said Perhaps you could thinkof some way to help him Ill tell youthe story but you mustnt say anythingabout it at home till after Ive toldfather Lets move back a little wayso he cant see us from down thereThey retreated a few steps from thebrow of the cliff and Elsie sat down upona log while Philip stretched himselfupon the grass at her feetThe trouble commenced a long timeago when the mountaineers used tomake whisky and sell it to the valleypeople she began They knew itwas against the law but I dont thinkthey cared much about that and anyway they kept on till one time therevenue officers raided the mountainAt that time John Kilgrow was livingon a little farm over yonder where yousee the old orchard and for years hehad been in the habit of making a fewgallons of apple brandy from the applesthat he couldnt sell Im sure he neverthought he was doing wrong andfather says he never sold any of thebrandj though he used to give it awaytsometimes to his neighbors Besidesthe place up here he owned a farm inthe big valley and that was rented outto a- man by the name of GatesFather says Cates always had a badname he used to encourage the mountaineers to make whisky and then hewould help them sell it in the valleyHe was owing Mr Kilgrow two orthree years back rent at the time ofthe raid and to get out of paying hetold the deputy constable or whatever you call him that Mr Kilgrowmade brandy offering to show him thehouse and the stillThe infernal wretch- I beg yourpardon I didnt mean to be profanePlease go onCates did what he said he wouldbut he was sharp enough to see thatMr Kilgrow might get clear if he wastaken or that he himself might be arrested as a witness so he went to MrKilgrow first and pretended to warnhim as a friend Did you ever hear ofsuch a mean thingNever I hope it didnt succeedYes it did it all turned out just asCates had planned The revenue mensurrounded the house but Mr Kilgrowgot out of a back window and ran Theychased him clear away over to the otherside of the mountain shooting at himWMP wTell me about him he urgedevery time they caught sight of -himand scaring the poor old man so thathe left the country and never did comeback till this spring And now as Isay hes afraid of everybodj exceptfather and he lives all alone in a cavedown there in the Pocket farming thatlittle patch of land for a livingAnd what became of the heav villain Cates I meanThats what makes it so bad Whenhe was sure that Mr Kilgrow had leftthe country he told it around that hehad bought the farm inthe valley- andwhen the new town company camealong he sold it to them took themoney and went awayThorndykes studies in the law hadnecessarily been the reverse of practical but as he sat up and reflectivelynursed his knees he was surprised atthe readiness with which the lawjerspoint of view suggested itselfHow large was this farm in thevalley he inquired after a few moments of thoughtful silenceI dont know that but father saysif Mr Kilgrow had his rights he wouldown half of AllaccocheePhilip went into another revery coming out of it to sa3r I wish I were wellI should enjoy taking up a thing of thiskind Ive half a mind to try it anyway and take the chances on livinglong enough to see it through Youdidnt know I was a lawyer did youNo indeed are youI presume Im not in the usefulsense of the word though I have apiece of parchment somewhere amongmjr belongings that says lam Perhapshowever I could scare up enough common sense to help your old friend outof his trouble it seems to be a veryclear caseOh Mr Thorndyke If you couldonly do thatHer fflce was alight with the sacredenthusiasm that makes an irresistiblespecial pleader of every good womanenlisted in the cause of the unfortunateand for the second time that day Thorndyke felt the subtle inspiration of herpersonality tingling through his veinsto lay a snare in her way by addiD j the fire of a strange wine ThereIm quite prepared for the worst youcan say Ill be dumb event if

incendiary things at the tip of histongue but he withheld them risingand saying that they had better goback to the farmhouse On the longwalk across the plateau he said but little asking an occasional question bearing upon Elsies story and listening attentively to her explanations Just before they came in sight of the house heasked her to wait a momentIf I am to do anything for your oldmountaineer

class nearly as numerous as those whogamble at all might well consider therecent announcement that a dividendof 4000000 for last year has been declared by tlyj stock company runningthe gaming tables at Monte CarloThat amount is the interest on 100000D00 and represents an extraordinaryprofit There are about 400000 visitorsa year at Monte Carlo and as in addition to the dividend named they pay theexpenses of the gaming resort with itsthousand attaches they will not be disposed to deny that gambling is a highlyexpensive amusement Though thereis a tradition that somebody occasionally breaks the bank at Monte Carloits dividends are never seriously affected They pour forth in an unbroken stream and the army of fresh victims is not apparently diminishedthough most of them are aware thatMonte Carlo in the language of a leading encyclopedia is a small town in theterritory of Monaco notorious on account of its gaming tables and thenumerous suicides of ruined gamblersAs the games at Monte Carlo appearto be what is called square even thosefamiliar Avith them are at a loss to account for the enormous profits Thechances in the play seem tobe almostevenly balanced yet the millions gravitate rapidly to the side of the bankSo it is in all gambling even in thoseforms where one side is not more expertor unscrupulous than the other Agambling bank has no emotions or passions In a certain sense it makes nobet of its own except to maintain thatthe outsider cannot bet right It hasno theories or S3rstems and allows others to wager money that they can fitone set of circumstances to another setEvery possible advantage of the gameis known to it and it is never compelledto draw out after risking its last coinIf the croupier is perfectly fair hegoes through his motions with indifference knowing that all the fallaciouscalculations and whimsical impulses ofthose who play against him will tellagainst them to his advantageIf the mere betting on red and blackwhich is prevalent at Monte Carlo isso profitable to the bank many otherforms of gambling are far worse It isneedless to name them The visitors toMonte Carlo could make at least 5000000 a year toy not going there It is alarge stake but they will not see it inthat light Gambling is ruinous in other ways than the loss of money It withdraws the mind from legitimate workand places it in the habitual attitude ofmerely waiting for chance results withthe possibility of a lucky strike whichseldom comes and when it does comeunsettles the energies and lowers thestamina One glance at the regularprofits of Monte Carlo is enough to condemn ali gambling and to warn thosewho indulge in it that the odds againsttheni are practically unlimited StLouis Globe DemocratGIANTS OF SAN NICOLASDiscoveries Wliiclr Prove Tliat tlieInhabitants Were Buried AliveA party of relic hunters recentlylanded on the island of San Ncolasand discovered many relics which theybrought backThe Clemente went after the partylast week but owing to a severe galein the channel was unable to effect alanding until yesterday The partyfound 87 skulls buried in the sand oithe island but were only able to sccure three entire They made one excavation 20 feet square in which theyfound nine skeletons in a crouchingattitude as though men women andchildren had been buried alive In another place they found the remains oihundreds of bodies that had beenburned and some of the party believethat cremation was practiced by- theancient people of the islandPositive evidence was found that theisland was inhabited by two or moredifferent races in the dim past one oiwhich was of great size a peculiar characteristic being gigantic jawbonesSome of the specimens of the latterbrought by the party are almost largeenough to slip over the head of an ordinary man Mr Longfellow the leaderof the party speaking of the trip saidOne of the most interesting relicsbrought back by us was part of askeleton of a large man in whose bonesa long bone spear point was stickingIn the shattered skull was a big roundstone used as a war implement Thespear passed through the heart and entirely through the shoulder blade 1am sure that two different races foughtand died on the island as most of thebodies were of moderate size whijesome were almost giants The latterwere always in isolated graves Wefound many implements and weaponsof stone but all are very crude and showalmost no ornamentationMr Longfellow says the island in alarge part along the coast is sand andpowdered shell which the Indians insome way made into cement This thevmolded into

mournfullyreproachfully despairingly The patient instructor stood meekly by holding the machine awaiting her pleasureWhat can be the matter the ladyaskedIts certainly mighty curious theinstructor replied shaking his headIm sure I dont ride half so well asI did at the last lessson proceeded theladyThats so admitted the candid in-structorNor quarter so well as at the onebefore thatNo mmAt my second lesson I rode half wayacross the room without you holdingthe wheelYou surely didAnd at the fourth lesson 1 almostmade a mount by myselfI seen yon do it and the instructortapped his fingers on the saddle by wayof emphasisAnd now pursued the lady in anindignant toneT I cant ride two feetwithout falling onTThe instructor lifted1 the bicycle upso that it rested on the front wheel andkicked the pedal around but said nothingWhat can the reason be persistedthe ladyThe instructor felt the tire of therear wheel but remained silentDo you suppose it could be the faultof the wheel asked the ladyHay exclaimed the instructor Mssurprise overcoming his politeness-I dont mean in that way the ladysaid hastily with a blush Of courseits really my fault in a way becauseI and not the wheel am learning toride But dont yoa think that thewheel may be misbehaving and thatthat may have something to do withitDo you mean that its out of orderasked the instructor beginning to pokearound among the joints and sprocketsNo said the lady only just sulkingI never heard of a bicycle sulkingreplied the instructor unsympatheticallyDidnt you returned the lady withgrowing enthusiasm Well then perhaps Ive discovered something newYou know that a sewing machine getssulky sometimes No O of coursenot if youve never used one Wellit does Sometimes it simply wontwork right Perhaps the weather affects it Then it will take a jump andrun along beautifully for days anddays It is simply mischiefNow the first day I rode this bicycleI got along beautifully on it and wasnta bit afraid and the second lesson wasthe same Then it began to be sulkyand I began to be afraid of it and Ivebeen getting more and more afraid of itever since Now how do you accountfor that if it really isnt the fault of thebicycle in getting sulky and frightening meYou got frightened because youtumbled off said the instructor in amatter-of-fact wayYes said the lady and why did Itumble off Because the bicycle wassulkj and began playing tricks on meOtherwise I ought to be making progress instead of falling back as I amdoing So dont you see that it reallyis the bicycles fault and not mine thatI am doing so badlyWell perhaps so said the instructorresignedlyThe wheel has had a rest said thelady perhaps it will be feeling betternow I will try it again- But keep agood hold of itAnd then she made another attemptto master the art

the foreign habitof lingering at the table they wouldbe healthfully as well as socially benefitedIn England and almost everywherein Europe the dining room is a feature -ofwell equipped homes It is

would -shootwater up ever so high in the airand she wasnt sure but she had heardtiiat Judge Potter was going to sendfrom his fine residence in the city hislour big stone frogs to sit under thefountain right among the fallingdiopsOh dear Bettie exclaimed catching her breath What if I cant goThe idea of not going was appallingAnd the more Bettie wanted to go themore she was afraid that she couldntgo To tell the truth she had prettygood grounds for her fearsIn the first place the only dress shehad fit to be seen was a thick greenand white and black woolen plaid andthe waist was lined with heavy drillingbesidesIt was a Avarm dress you see onethat would have been appropriate towear to a picnic in January if ever theydo have picnics in that month Butunluckily it was not January now Itwas August the hottest month in theyear And Bettie could not wear thatwarm dress of hers without feelingpretty uncomfortable in it and makingeverybody else rfeel uncomfortable justfrom seeing her wear itTo be sure jshe did have two othercooler dresses fchat she wore arouud athome a yellow calico and a pink oneBut the yellow in the one had baseldeserted in great patches here andthere all over the -dress leaving queerlooking white spots and as for thepink one it was neither one thing noranother not exactly pink not exactly white Tout as Bettie herself described it just faded to deathCertainly neither -of -these dresseswould do any more than the plaid oneBettie had thoughtfully consideredthem allBut aside from the what to wear question it happened that Uetties motherwas more than usually busy aboutthis timeShe expected to have to go to MrsMontandons to clean house the verjday of the picnic And if she did goshe wanted Bettie to stay at home andtake care of her little sister Coia do upthe housework milk the cow at nightand carry around the milk to their twoor three customers and have supperready when she got homeBettie had often done all this beforefor she was used to working as well asher mother She hoped to work forwages some timeShe had secretly resolved to coax hermother into buying her a new calicodress for the picnic if she should findout in time that Mrs Montandon didnot want her mother on the picnic dayThen if her mother would just cutand fit the dress she would sew up theyearns herself in a very sliest time ButMrs Cochran positively could not afford to lose this chance of earning adays wages and so when Mrs Montantfon sens around word that she wouldneed hor the day of the picnic MrsCochran agreed to goOf course theres no use in talkingabout buying a dress now thoughtl appointed BettiejUSketl have to ty athom cren ifehtdid have oneAnd now Ive Teached that pant of mystory where Bettie gets into troublefalls into temptation and I do declareit makes me feel real bad to go onWhat a pity that shedid not try harderto resist the temptationIt seems to me if I were a little girlI wouldnt do such a thing as she did forthe world And thats about what youllaj I suppose when you hear the restBut let us be charitable Perhapsweve all of us done things quite aswrong as this that Bettie did if notworse And then you must rememberthat Bettie wanted to go to the picnicawfully Besides she got punished severely enough in the end for what shedid For sooner or later in some formor another punishment and sorrow docome for wrong doingWell not to moralize further themorning of the picnic came and MrsCochran who really had no idea howmuch her Bettie was disappointedabout going to the picnic bustled off toher workBettiehadthebluesdreadfully afterher mother was gone She sat down inthe rocking chair and cried as hard asever she could cry tfor nearly lialf anhour But crying doesnt do any goodand after awhile Bettie seemed to thinkso herself for she stopped crying andbegan putting the house in orderShe was sweeping in front of thebig clothes press where Jier motherkept the clean Clothes she had doneup for her customers until she wasready to send them home when suddenly the doors of the press flew openThey never would stay tight shut asthev shouldThe very moment those doors flewopen and Bettie glanced in the presshe had a bright idea but it wasnta right idea and Im sure I wish shehadnt had itThere was one bundle of clothes thatbelonged to a lady named Mrs Stevensand Betties mother had not sent theclothes home yet because Mrs Stevenswas out of town and wouldnt be backfor a whole two weeksMrs Stevens had a little girl justabouf Betties size and Bettie knewthat among the clothes was LuluStevens white muslin dress She hadseen her mother take it off the clotheshorse fold it and put it away in thepressNow why couldnt she just takeLulus dress and wear it to the picnicShe did not believe Lulu would care atallSIie was a real nice girl and perhaps thought Bettie some day along time afterward Ill tell her Iwore it tAnd then she did it She put thatother girrs dress on took Cora and offthey started to the picnicI cant say that Bettie had a good timeat the picnic and i cant say that shedidnt for I really dont know how shedid feel in that borrowed ck ess Bullshouldnt think she could have enjoyedherself very much under the circumstances Should youOne thing I know She didnt dare toplay any of the games with the othergirls for fear of tearing Lulu Stevenswhitedressand she didnt daresit downon the grass wTith the rest for fear ofsoiling itBut when about noon little Corawho had been enjoying herself amazingly eating cake and pie and picklesspilled a lot of apple pie all over thefront breadth of Lulu Stevens dressBettie became so fidgety that shecouldnt bear to remain at the picnic aminute longer so she took Cora andwent straight homeBettie had not been a washwomansdaughter all her life for nothing andwhile she was walking home she madeup her mind to wash and iron and starchthat dress and put it away in thetdothes press before her mother gothome and never never never againwould she put on her mothers customers clothesShe was suffering already from herWrongdoing you see But there wasrctore trouble in store for poor BettieAnd now I have reached the tragicalpart of my storyBettie washed and starched the dressaiLd hung it on the line to dry but shenever saw the whole ot that dress againfor while she was trying to rock littleCora to sleep who was just as cross asa bear because of the cake and thepickles she had eaten the cow walkedthrough the barnyard gate which Bettie had neglected to fasten in her hasteto be off to the picnic and chewedLulu Stevens nnislin dress all to piecesThe cow was hungry and a starcheddress was better than nothing at all toeatWhat Bettie did when she found outthis terrible thing and what Bettiesmother did when she found it out andwhat Mrs Stevens did when she foundit out Ill have to leave for you to guessBut dont you think that Betties yielding to temptation led to unhappinessenough that time Golden DaysThat Olrt CombinationLi view of the bicycle craze

caring for horses duringthe summer is of more importance thansupplying them with water It is a matter for regret that it is necessary to callattention to the negleet of workinghorses in this respect but it seems-necessary to do so Many men whofeed their stock liberally furnish warmplaces for them in winter and keep thestables as cool as possible during thesummer seem to forget that the teamthat is working under the burning sunin the field from morning until noonmust suffer fiom tMrst in a way thatis intensely agonizingAny man who tries to work half aday in the harvest field without drinking will soon begin to feel some of theeffects of going without water whenmaking severe exertion on a hot dayand will appreciate the condition of ahard working horse under the sameconditionsSometimes it seems like a waste oftime to stop a team and take it to get adrink but time spent in this way isnever wasted for the team will doenough more to moke up for the stopThere are places where it seems impossible to give the team a drink betweenbreakfast and noon and between noonand supper but there is no shadow ofexcuse for leaving a team hitched tothe fence without water while the drivergoes to his sirpper and then comes backto work the team until dark withoutwater from noon until that time Sucha proceeding is not so common as itonce was but it is still practiced tosome extent and is the worst sort ofcruelty to animalsHorses perspire freely and are theonly domestic animals that do ajidtheir need for water is increased as theamount of perspiration increases andduring the hot weather every effortshould be made to prevent them fromsuffering from thirst which is the worstsort of torture Farmers VoiceRation for Growing PigsPigs during growth should be fedon muscle making foods A

the importantpart played by bees in agriculture onecannot help wondering why the experiment stations of the United States payso little attention to beekeeping Wedo not recall a single station where bee- Jkeeping is carried on at all The ithodeIsland station has a department devoted to poultry and bees but if memoryserves that has been abandonedHoney bees and the bumble bees areexpert in some lines of agriculturalwork that men do not very well under-stand and could not succeed in if theytried ever so hard They do a very important work and do it for nothingboarding themselves in the meantimeIf it Were not for bees we would nothave large fruit crops if we did not experience entire failures At the timewhen fruit trees are in bloom there arebut few insects abroad and if the beesdo not visit the blossoms in search ofhoney the fruit would never mature asit would not be pollenizedIf it were not for the work of bees wecould not grow clover and this important crop would be unknown So Jtant is this that large sums of moneyhave been spent to import bees intoAustralia in order that clover might begrown thereHoney bees follow civilization and areunknown where civilized man has nottaken up his residence They are colaborers with the pioneer and help himto conquer the wilderness and in theintroduction of improved fruits andcropsEvery home owner from the villagerto the bonanza farmer should keepbees for the help they are to agriculture alone The business of bee-keepingis not well understood even by experts and there is a great opportunityfor good work from the experiment stations in promoting a wider knowledgeand a greater interest in bee keepingan industry that might be indefinitelyextended with profit to those who keepthem and to those whose field they roamover in search of honey FarmersVoiceCHICKEN EATING HOGSA Leather IUintl That Will Cure Themof the HahitA chicken catcher in a herd of hogsis most exasperating and expensiveOne such will soon transform a
