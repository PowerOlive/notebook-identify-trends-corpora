. y,our very heart the tragedy of a girl who married for protec
tion, not love, and afterwards found she needed protection from
.her husband. "And through it all flits the romantic figure of
a pale musician who murders for love's sake.

ed last night, with a large number of

pastor of one of the county churches,
conducted the musical part of the
services.
Sunday, May 4, has been desig
nated as "Go-to-Sunday-School-Day"
for Kentucky. But why wait till
that day to be rounded up and taken
to Sunday school? Why not start
now, and be in full swing by the
time the rally day comes on. There
is no good reason why every pro
fessed Christian should not be as reg
ular in his attendance upon Sunday
school as he is at his place of busi
ness the other six days of the week.
A great all-day rally has been
planned to take place at the Paris
Methodist church next Sunday, the
occasion being in the nature of a-get-together
meeting. Several not
ed speakers from outside the State
and other points in the State will be
present. The women of the church
will serve lunch at the noon hours
for all present.
The services will begin at 9:30 a.
m., with special services for the Sun
day school. About an hour will be
devoted to the lunch and the program
will close about three o'clock, with
no services at night. Miss Louie
Bruer has been appointed chairman
of the lunch committee and Miss Oli
country ham, potato salad, dressed
eggs, beaten biscuit, sandwiches,
coffee, ice cream and cake. That
sounds good, doesn't it? The feast
forthe spiritual man will be just as
good. The occasion is for Methodists
and those inclined to be Methodists
and we want all of them present.
The program will begin at 9:30 a.
m. with special exercises in the Sun
day School. There will be an hour
for lunch at noon. Special music.
No special collection.

THE LEXINGTON RACES.
The sporting spirit is inherent in
the native Kentuckian, and will not
be downed. He or she may read with
little enthusiasm of some exciting
race at some far-off track, but when
the fleet-footed kings and queens of
the turf begin to show up closer to
home, say at the Lexington track,
their enthusiasm grows intense.
On all sides yesterday was heard
the query, "Are you going to attend
the opening of the races at Lexing
ton to-day?" Automobiles in large
numbers lined the way on the Lex
ington pike, while the L. & N. and
the interurban cars carried their
quota of race-goers. The city of
Paris looked like a deserted village in
the afternoon all gone to the races!
Many of the court house officials
left the conduct of their offices to
their assistants, and many business
men took an afternoon -off in order
to enjoy the "sport of all sports."
Some came back elated, others were
belated, sad and folorn, and wearing
a look which told plainer than
words, "I bet on the wrong horse."
