The next is the man who"don't believe in fighting." A thirdis not particularly a foe but a contemptible something you cannot namewithout apology to the ghoul theman of that low and mercenary nature that would make profit of thisawful tragedy of human woe andcarnage of death. That we have theseparticular types may not be the causeof such fearful upheavals, but theless we have of them, the easier theyare to suppress. The 'wrong is oftenstrong only in proportion to the unbelief, moral cowardice and mercenary nature of the -non-resisting orthose who have no part. Cumberland Presbyterian Banner.Rightly stated but then we haveother dangerous foes in the guise ofso-called patriots who chirp to thecry. "You must not criticise the Government, because that is disloyal."Such people are more interested inparty than in country; more interested in saving the reputation ofsome incompetent official than insaving the lives-of soldiers; more interested in suppressing the truthfor fear somebody will be hurt politically, than in saving the nation.This country needs to know thetruth. We are not a nation of babies, fearing to face facts, but manypeople appear to think so. It is onlyby overturing the log and letting inthe sunlight that the worm-eaten,barren land gives forth fresh andvigorous life to vegetation. "Let inthe sunlight of truth everywhere"should be the nation's rule.SOUTH AFRICA FINDS NEW FABRIC JFORJPAPER.South Africa has discovered anew source of paper supply.About 40,000 tons of bark of thewattle tree are exported annuallyfrom South and East Africa for usein tanyards, and experiments showthat the bark, after the tanning propreties have been removed, is capable of being converted into excellentbrown paper or mill board.40.00 1 j.

Letters from the Federal Fue'iCommission at Washington, have beenpublished in the dailies and theweekly papers all over the country,pertaining to the subject. The latestof these is the following, just received here by Mr. James H. Thompson, Federal Fuel Administrator forBourbon county:"To All Chairmen Federal Fuel Committee: "As information and for publication in your local newspapers, the following is quoted as emanating fromthe Washington office:"The Fuel Administration isgreatly encouraged by reports frommay parts of the country as to theprogress of its campaign for the earlyordering of next winter's supply ofcoal by both domestic and industrialcoal consumers, particularly in theFastern part of the country. Aifloodof orders for next winter's coal supply is reported. Both, coal producersand retailers report orders filedastly in excess of the amount available for immediate delivery."With, millions of tons ordered, ofcourse it has been impossible to effectcomplete deliveries. This has givenrise to some complaint among thoseho are patriotically responding tothe request of the Fuel Administration and have sought to lay in theirwinter's supply. It will be readilyappreciated, however, that the minesproduce and the railroads cannot deliver the whole annual supply of thecountry within two weeks. The FuelAdministration, however, will exertevery effort to expedite deliveriesand to effect the distribution of amaximum amount of coal during thesummer months."With, the country's coal supplylargely ordered ahead, the Administration will be in a position to actr-romptly and facilitate the movementof an adequate supply of coal to meetthe demand. The railroads will beenabled to judge of the traffic facilities which must be made availablefor aiding coal production and fordistributing the supply."The fact the consumers cannotsecure immediate delivery should notdeter them from placing their ordersat once. These early orders once onHie books become the basis for thedetermined drive, to secure an adequate production and prompt distribution. Promptness in ordering and3patience in awaiting deliveries areneeded as a basis for the co-operation,of the whole country with, the FuelAdministration in its effort to do itsshare of the Nation's war work."It is trusted that this matter willbe brought to the attention of thepeople in your community."Yours truly,"WILEY B.

C. Carter, writes that there aremore than a hundred important portswithout workers," said Mr. Tevebaugh. "Forty-seven of these arenear the front and 38 are actuallyunder shell fire. We believe that nocollege or bank presidency or bigcity pulpit is of so great national importance as a hut secretaryship inFrance."The French government, throughits premier and commander-in-chief,has asked for an immediate extension of the Y. M. C. A. to the Frencharmies. Knowing that we could, notsupply all the needs at once theyhave asked us to supply 250 men amonth to man their Foyers de Soldat.The Italian army wants fifty men atonce and promises to place at theirdisposal young Italians who can betrained quickly to extend the workon the Austrian front."Every Y.

We areparticularly seeking successful business and professional men, those ofhigh Christian character, good mixers, men resourceful and adaptableto conditions as they find them. Wewant the highest class of men America has produced, for the highesttype of work of their fellowmenwhich can be offered."Some of them will be sent perhaps actually up to the firing line.All will see conditions which tearmen's souls.

Ofthese,' only two returned to the pigeon loft, and both of these were seriously injured by shot" gun .wounds.The officers in charge believe thatnone, of this shooting is with intentto kill the Government pigeons, butas one officer expressed, "Is simplyan example of the thoughtless boywith a shotgun.""Carrier pigeons are of vital importance in modern Warfare," saidMajor Clarence A.

"They carry "messageswhen mother .means fail and it is.yeryimportant that each division hae Awell trained corps. It is earnestlyrequested that people refrain fromshooting carrier pigeons. Inasmuchas it is quite, impossible for the ordinary person to distinguish, between,a carrier pigeon and other types ofpigeon, it is asked that they be verycareful in shooting any kind of.pigeon."Very often the carrier pigeonswill stop to rest at strange lofts.
