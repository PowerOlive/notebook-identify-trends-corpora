The temperature rose gradually Sunday, andyesterday was somewhat better.There has been but a slight evidence of thaw, and very little of thesnow which has impeded travel,covered roofs of houses and theground, has melted beyond a slightsoftning of the top 'crust. Some ofthe country roads are still in badshape, though the county roadscrapers have rendered most of themopen to travel. Beaten paths on thesidewalks were frozen yesterday,making walking dangerous.Several farmers were in Paris, Saturday and Sunday for the first timesince the elements made them virtually prisoners on their, ownfarms. One of them told ' THENEWS man of endeavoring to forcea passage through an immensedrift on the Harrod's Creek pikewith an auto, and not succeeding.Returning home he brought sixmen with big scoop shovels and cutthrough the drift, which was piledup to a height of twelve feet, according to actual measurements.Another told of being stalled in abig drift on the Paris and Cynthianapike, and digging his way out, hadto abandon his machine, and returnon foot to his home. And there heremained until Saturday, when withhelp he secured his machine andtowed it to Paris. Numerous instances of the kind could be recounted. Relief from the coal shortage ispromised by the action of the Louisville & Nashville in releasing coalshipments held on side tracks. Thegas pressure is still low and unsteady at times.

Already 440,000,000 of the littleChristmas stickers have been printed and distributed throughout theUnited States.Agents in every State and territory in the Union from Alaska tothe Canal Zone and from Porto Ricoand Hawaii and even in the far offPhilippines have been making demands for the 'stamps. Throughthese agents the Seals will be distributed to the local and State antituberculosis associations and to other agencies through which they willbe put on sale.Every effort is being made to stimulate the sale of the Seals this yearso the ? 3, 00 0,0 00 fund which is theobjective will be realized. The country's entry into the war and theconsequent revelation of the prevalence of tuberculosis and the dangerin which the disease has placed ourarmy has added incentive to the campaign. Every man, woman and child isbeing asked to triple the amount oftheir Red Cross Seal purchases thisyear. If they bought a hundr.edSeals last year, they are being asked to buy three hundred this year,as the annual fund to be raised mustbe increased from the 1916 of $1,000,000 to $3,000,000.Advertising circulars, post cardsand letters are being sent out to aidin the sale of Seals Upwards of2,000,000 personal letters have beenwritten, and an army of fully 500,000 workers, most of them volunteers, are busy booming the campaign. Few people who buy the little messages of Christmas cheer realizethat more than 1,500 anti-tuberculosisassociations of the country derive their chief support from RedCross Christmas Seals.Fa 2 giaTRIANGLE REPRESENTED ATBENEFIT.Walter Perry, well-known character actor at the Triangle CulverCity Studio, will appear on the program to be given just beforeChristmas for the boys in theNaval Reserves and Coast ArtilleryCorps now stationed at San Pedro,Cal.

KENTUCKIAN. .T.T.: TT m .. . i. !iu.ii.jux. .nenry ureman iuien, anative of Sharpsburg, Ky., Commanding the Ninetieth Division of the U.S. Army, at Camp Travis, Texas, isthe subject of a most complimentarysketch which appeared in the SanAntonio Express, on November 19.lhe writeup of Major Allen in-eludes an excellent likeness of this 'popular army officers, who has rendered such excellent service to hiscountry, together with a threecolumn notice highly complimentaryto maj. Alien.In referring to Maj. Allen thewriter in the Express refers to himin part as follows:. "Fairness and efficiency characteristic of Maj. Allen put at head ofNinetieth Division because he is aleader of men and knwos the gameof war. The people of Texas andOklahoma have an interest in Gen.Allen that beggars description. Tohim they have confided the keepingof their husbands, sons, brothers andloved ones, and upon his shouldersrents the responsibility of the future welfare of these soldiers, 30.000red-blooded men who are ready toanswer any summons and are prepared to go wherever duty calls themas it's people. And it should be amatter to inspire confidence in the !hearts of the stay-at-homes 'that GenAllen was selected to lead the 90th iDivision not because of any accident of birth, nor yet because of anvpolitical affiliation, but because hehas been tried time and again inmilitary matters, and each time hasbeen found not wanting."Major Allen can qualify as a man iwith a heart stored with love. He Ihas perhaps the largest family of any Idren at Camp' Travis and each andevery one of them has been the recipient of his square dealings. Whileexacting that obedience, that mustbe secured to win battles, Gen. Allen thas for his enlisted men of his divi- 'sion a feeling of affection that crops !out in a thousand ways. He wants j"his boys" to find soldiering a pleas- jure and not an irksome task, and to jthis end he never tires of having ar- iranged for them those moments of !recreation that have become dearto the soldiers at Camp Travis." jMajor Allen is related to a large 'number of Bourbon families of prom-1inence, and has oh numerous occa- jsions visited in Bourbon County iwhere he is well known. jMajor Allen is a first cousin ofMr. W. B. Allen, of Paris, .and an'uncle of Mr. Sanford Allen, Mrs. IOwen Ingels and Mrs. Louis Rogers, 'of Bourbon, and of Mrs. Jesse Alver- 'son, of Georgetown, children of fjhe ;late Mr. Julian G. Allen, who was abrother of Major Allen.Ki 3 Paj imWtmx JmpmWGovernment FirstTremendr--- as is the present activity in themarshaling c. men, food and munitions for cneconduct of the war, the placing of the Bell system unqualifiedly at the disposal of the government has relieved one paramount factor of preparedness. Every American who wants to help win thiswar should bear in mind that private service mustgive way to government service should emergencies require that everything be subordinated tothe telephone demands of the army, the navyand other representatives of the government.So when the increased business of fall and winter is reflected in your telephone service by a slowing down and by more frequent "busy" reports,remember that we are using every means at ourcommand-to keep our service up to its usual standard. Every available position at our switchboardis occupied and it is difficult to secure additional.positions because Uncle Sam's requirements havereduced the available supply of material to thepoint where manufacturers cannot make a definitepromise of delivery.Here's how you can help. Use the teleDhone only for necessary calls, particularly duringthe busy hours of the day.
