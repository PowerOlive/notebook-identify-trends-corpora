That the 1913 crop of tobacco in
Nicholas county will be one of the
shortest ever raised in the county is
now certain. Growers coming from
some sections of the country report
that their crops have been virtually
abandoned, owing to the fact that they
have been ruined by the dry weather.
One grower reported that tobacco in
his section was literally burning up
and would not be worth housing at all.
Indicatinos are that thhe corn crop will
alsobes hort, as the droughht has prac
tically ruined much of it already. A
vegetable famine is also threatened.
The inrush of cattle to the Kansas
City stock yards from the dry sections
of Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and
Missouri, which began in earnest Mon
day, whhen 30,000 head were unloaded
continued Tuesday with the receipt of
16,000 more. For the two days of this
week 46,000 cattle have been received,
20,000 more than Monday and Tuesday
of last week, and nearly twice as many
as were received at the Chicago stock
yards in two days preceding.
Prices were 15 to 25c. a hundred low
er, making adrop of 50c. to $1.25 a hun
dred in the last ten days.
Commission men said that letters
and telegrams from the stock-raising
districts were gloomy and indicated
that unless rain-came soon the flooding
of the local cattle market would be re
doubled. REMARKABLE CURE

I was unable to do anything and my
Weight dropped from 145 to 125
