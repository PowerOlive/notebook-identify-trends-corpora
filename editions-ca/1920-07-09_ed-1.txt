Yesterdaymorning when the porter went tohis room to call him, White calledout that he would be out in a fewmoments.

Weather conditions during the past few weeks have beenfavorable for the setting and maturing of the- seed. Stripping beganaround June 15 and the seed was ofheavy weight and high germination.A slightly decreased acreage ofKentucky Bluegrass was harvestedfor seed in Kentucky this year because some of the Bluegrass meadows have been plowed and plantedto tobacco and corn, which cropsare ' considered at this time to bemore remunerativev The favorableweather during the past few weekshas beer, conductive to the properdevelopment and ripening of theseed and the indications are thatthe quality of this year's seed willbe superior tc that of last year.The 1919 crop seed was light andchaffy because of the freeze the lastof April and first of May and because of the hot, dry weather jusibefore stripping was begun. Theproduction in this section last yearis estimated to have been 350,000bushels stripped seed, which cleaned out only about- 55 or 60 per cent.by weight.Tlis year, however, because of aprospective increase of about 33 1-3per cent in the yield per acre it isestimated that the total productionwill be 425,000 bushels, whichshould clean out about 65 or 70 pecent by weight. Based on t thesefigures the production of recleanedseed this year will be about 35 percent greater than in 1919. No pricehas been established for the roughseed as practically no contracts havebeen made. Shippers would buy therough Feed at $1J0 per bushel, butgrowers state twit because of theadvance in the price of land, equipment, and labor they must receivea higher price than last year, whichwas 1.50 to $1.65 per bushel.1 o 'souEBOir county oioar OKD.

We know it will help you as itdid Mrs. IoppL,"Is the effect ot -the motion picture on' the youth had, as some wouldhave us believe?" . (The question was put to JudgeBen B. Lindsay, founder of the juvenile court in Denver, Col., andprobably the foremost authorityon juveniles in the country. His reply was emphatic."Is the effect bad?" he replied."On the contrary, it is overwhelmingly good."It is one of the really great mediums for impressing the youthwith the idea of being better. Themotion picture is doing a greatwork, and doing it well. It is notonly furnishing millions with entertainment, but it is having a beneficial effect on young and old."To show his sincerity in thuslauding the motion picture of today, Judge Lindsay has temporarilybecome a screen actor. Both he andhis wife "play themselves" "in thecurrent William D. Taylor production for Paramount-Artcraft. Thepicture is from an original story byJulia Crawford Ivers and deals withthe human theme of the boy problem, "'the boy" being played byjoung Lewis Sargent, of "Huckleberry Finn" fame. 'It was Mrs Ivers who inducedJudge Lindsay to take part in thepicture. She made a special trip toDenver to secure atmosphere for thepicture and if possible to secure hiraas a member of the cast."At first I was dubious," say?Judge Lindsay, "for it was such aradical departure. But I realizedwliat a valuable medium the screenwould be as an aid to me in myefforts to bring about a properhandling of the boy problem, and Iaccepted. The production is -not apropaganda picture; it does notpreach; but I fee sure the publicwill catch the message I am tryingto give."I am a strong friend of the motion picture. Those who assail itare, I believe, mistaken."Possibly there have been instances where a motion picture hada bad effect on juveniles, but thoseinstances have been so rare as to bhnegligible. What if a boy does playhookey to see a movie' show? Isbase ball a menace because boysonce in a while sneak away fromschool to see a game?"I have heard people say thatboys learn to commit crimes fromseeing them done on the screen.Never in all my experience withboys do I recall any boy telling mehe did wrong because of a motionpicture."Undoubtedly many motion pictures have not been of as high standard as they should have been Butthe big majority are of a very highorder. And as pictures are now thegeneral effect is entirely good."",1.i-ftaT 1aAs A Table Dibstommeets every requirement !iThe flavor, much like superiorcoffee, always pleases; and whenI a health and economy are considered, this wholesome beveragefits every needBoil Pcstum Cereal fully 15minutes, after boiling begins orif you, prefer a quickly preparedt . drink, buy the newer form -tInstant Postum, which is madeinstantly in 'the cup.There's a Reason! ?? -for PostumMade by Postum Cereal Company, Inc.Battle Creek, Michiganr"I COULD HOT ASKTO FEEL BETTER".Had, Terrible Nervous Chills AndCould Hardly Digest a Thins: 'Before Taking?

It ismuch easier to iemoe' these weedsbefore stripping the bluegrass thanit is to remove other seed after itbecomes mixed with bluegrass seed.Approximately 76 of all samples ofbluegrass received at the Experiment Station in 1919-1920, showedcontamination from sour dock. Thisis a ,very high percentage and if thefarmers of the Central Bluegrassexpect their bluegrass seed to compete with that from other stateslike Missouri, they should makeevery possible effort to have theseed free from sour dock. In .some.cases the percentage of sour dockseed in samples was so high that itdid not meet with the requirementsof the Kentucky Seed Law.The farmers in the Bluegrasshave improved the germination byJmnrnvfid methods of handling thestripped bluegrass seed, and if theywill follow up this improvement byremoving sour dock and other contaminating: weeds at this season,TCp.ntnr.lt v hluesrrass will be of thehighest quality.oBFirst Mortgage Gold BondsThe Standard Safe 6 Investment , BecauseThey are first mortgages on definitepieces of choice improved LouisvilleHeal Estate.They yield 6 net from date of purchase.
