The Commercial Club hasnot permanently laid on the shelfthe idea of a hotel for Paris norlias the Board of Directors desertedthe intention cf fostering such aproject. When the concensus ofopinion of sound .business men isthat Paris and Bourbon county is infinancial condition, and unmistakable signs of prosperity point to thatfact, then the Commercial Clubhopes to organize and develop a successful campaign for a creditableand profitable hotel in Paris.It was decided to give a dinneron May 11, at 6:30 p. m. RoxieDavis was appointed chairman of theCommittee on Entertainment withpermission to keep 'the plans for thisdinner a secret.

He busted right intothe editorial office with a heartrending plea for complete suppression ofthe facts, "for the sake of his innocent wife and daughters."The woods are full of 'em.Bobbed hair is said to add to thestrength.

Mostof the sitting members, it appears,will, through the strength of theirrespective local machines, be renominated. It is. evident that the peoplehave already made up their mindsto vote for sweeping changes in thepresent complexion of Congress.President Harding's attitude of keeping aloft offers striking proof thatwhile he, in common with the OldGuard crowd, was anxious to seeNewberry seated, he cannot workhimself up to the point of engagingin personal activities in future support of the present Republican Congress. The most terribfe commentaryon "this Congress, therefore, is thefact that Republican leaders whocould stomach Newberryism cannotstomach the sitting Republican Congress." ojWEEKLY REVIEW OF POULTRYAND EGG MARKETUnseasonable weather still holdsback the marketing" of poultry, butter and eggs bjr the producers, caus-iiig liiiii iuuiivt;i.s iui eauii jjiuuuui.The demand for live and dressedpoultry is nominal and receipts aboutusual for this period of the year.Butter production should increaserapidly from now on, and while thedemand is extremely good, it is natural to expect lower prices.As the demand for May storageeggs is not as good as Tor April's,the. prospects are that the egg market will work to a lower level bythe first of May.

"A Humiliating Confession," he is puzzledby that title; for the pamphlet tellsthe story of Urey Woodson's Messenger, published and edited by him atOwensboro for forty years. Newspaper men knew there is nothing humiliating in that story, and only asearch reveals what humiliationMr. Woodson can confess."It is a humiliating confession,"he says, "that, after more than fortyyears' endeavor to produce one of thefbest small dailies in the. country, wehave sadly fallen behind in caringfor our own interests; we have failed to establish advertising rates forthe Messenger that are fair to anawspaper of its circulation andmerit.1'. If Urey Woodsonjias failed in thatthen that must be his one failure.For he has certainly succeeded inproducing 'one of the best smalldailies in the country."

Dirt, cold cream, rouge andpowder will clog the pores, enlargethem and produce blackheads andblemishes unlesss the skin is cleansedthoroughly with soap and water atleast once every day.This simple method of beautifyingwas Cleopatra's secret. She knew thatto have a fresh fine skin thoroughcleansing was necessary. She used Palmand Olive oils, the same rare oilswhich are blended in Pahnolive.If you use a fine mild soap, thereis no danger of irritation. Pahnolivewith its creamy latKer, is lotion-like inits action. It freshens, revives andstimulates and leaves the skin delightfully fresh and rosy.You can buy Pahnolive Soap at allfirst class groceries and drug stores.THE PALMOLTVE COMPANYMilwaukee, Wis.Many persons, some of them posing as teachers of economics of acertain kind, advocated an increasein the circulating medium as thesolution of the trade difficulties ofthe times. Others hold that suchincrease would be futile, if not dangerous, and they point to Europe asan example of inflated currency.It seems strange that any personwho has followed the experience 'ofmost European countries since thewar will still adhere to the ideathat money is something that requires only a government stamp tomake it Taluable. Germany, Russia,Poland and some other countries ofEurope know that this can not bedone.There is enough money in theUnited States to finance all themanufacturing -and business Bnterprises for which there is a legitimatedemand in the production of goods.This demand can not be created bythe issue of "large quantities of currency, but by the inclination to buy.It is methods, not money, whichthe various interests of the UnitedStates need. There must be moreeconomical distribution of manufactured and agricultural porducts, andthere must be adjustments in otherlines that will make conditions morenormal. When that it done, threwill be money for all genuine needsof the nation, but if more is neededthe government need not resort tofiat issues of currency.DYE DRESS.

C Poster, of Madison, Wis.,Deputy Commissioner of the Bureauof Markets, is in Lexington to studytheplan of the burley association.Mr. Foster is one of the leaders in a rmovement in Wisconsin to organizethe tobacco growers along the linesof the Kentucky: association and hascome here, as he expresses it, "toget some 'thunder' for the membership campaign" which he plans tostart within a few weeks.Mr. Foster said Wisconsin grows,annually, about 60,000,000 poundsof cigar type tobacco. He said -thexv v urop som at an average of40 cents a pound.' The 1921 cropsold last winter for less than 7, centsa pound. As a consequence, he said,the Wisconsin growers are facingconditions similar to those .that existed in Kentucky one year ago, andtne growers realize they must organize for self-protection.Mr. Foster, who has T)een in conference with officials of the association, said he was greatly impressedby the wonderful 'progress the organization has made in so short a time,and he assured these men that,within a few months, Wisconsinwould join hands with Kentucky.Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, the Carolinas and other States that haveadopted the .co-operative plan jofmarketing tobacco.Hugh West, of Hdpkinsville, Ky7,also visited the association's -offices.Mr. West who is from the dark tobacco district, and one of the primemovers in the organization workthere, reports that the prospects fora co-operative in Western Kentuckyand Tennessee are very encouragmg. m "Plans are being formulated forbeginning within a few weeks another intensive campaign for members. Every county already organized will be recanvassed, but specialeffort will be made to sign up thesmall percentage of burley growersstilL outside.Mr. Stone predicts that in thenear future the Burley Associationwill. have control of practically theentire burley tobacco production.The field service division reported the receipt, during the week, of115 contracts, representing about300,000 pounds. Of these thirtywere received from Bracken county,thirteen from Rockcastle and tenBoone, Kentucky, and nineteen fromIndiana.""

This in itself is a step forward and paves theway for a frank exchange of views.In view of some recent history,the "French government hardly canbe blamed for being unwilling torun the risk of losing the fruits ofthe treaty of Versailles until someother means of putting the prostratenations on their feet have been considered. One of the great hopes forthe success of the meeting lies in theBritish premier's leadership. Noother statesman of the present is sowell fitted for the difficult task hefaces.American public sentiment approves the admission of the Germansto the conference, whatever itsopinion of the propriety of admitting the Bolsheviki as representatives of the Russian people. The objection of the French and Belgiansto the inclusion of their former foesin the membership of the principalcommittee is easily understood, butit is gratifying that ther listened tothe British premier's counsel andchanged their attitude.PUBLIC OPTION"There may have been a timewhen somepublic utilities turnedtheir backs oi public opinion butthat time has certainly passed" saidthe operator of a large public utilityfollowing the meeting of the American Electric Railway Association atIndianapolis last month.At this meeting, one of the foremost men in the public utility business, Samuel Insull, President ofthe Commonwealth Edison Companyof Chicago, made a speech on thesubject of "Public Relations themost important asset for a utility."Mr. Insull very aptly hit the nail onthe head when he said:"Our trouble lies mainly in thefact that for a great many years welacked understanding of the economics of our business ourselves and thatat this time a knowledge of the trueeconomics is confined to a few of thepeople' engaged in those businesses.What we need worse than anythingelse is to sell aoui: business to ourown officials and employes and thensell it to the public."o.
