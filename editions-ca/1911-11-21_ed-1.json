Use Leisure Time Wisely. f

the cord of some definite purpose and

he makes of his leisure time. Taylor,

Friend Did you write that editorial
advocating pie for breakfast?

the pie trust! Puck.
Moral In Evolution.
The history of evolution Is one long
record of victory in the face of appar
ently insuperable obstacles. Man is

possible or that which seems such to
weakness and folly. Rev. W. E. i.

Patrolman Link's Effective
Work.
Patrolman Fred Link has been ex
ceptionally busy the past few days
and succeeded in bringing three viola
tors to justice, all of whom were in
the courts yesterday and in each in
stance they drew fines or jail sen
tences. L. P. Atkinson, a foreman
of a construction crew on the L. & N.,
came to town from down the road Fri
day and imbibed freely, became bois
terous nnd was locked up by Patrolman
Link. He was given his liberty and
contrary to his promises to sober up
took on a few more and Saturday
morning woke to find himself behind
the bars. Atkinson had on his person
a large sum of money which was taken
from him when he was jailed and upon
his promises to appear in Police Court
yesterday morning was again given
his liberty. In Police Court yesterday
morning he faced two charges of
drunkenness and disorderly conduct
and drew two fines amounting in the
aggregate to $35.
Wm. Garrett, colored, was placed
under arrest by Patrolman Link Sat
urday night. Garrett ran amuck on
Sycamore street, where he was f ouna
by the officer. He was armed with a
club with which he used upon another
of his color with telling effect, a pistol
and a badge sent out from the Ameri
can Detective Agency. The latter he
thought would pull him through his
trouble and it was displayed to the
arresting officer, and claimed he had
no authority to arrest him. In spite
of his protests Garrett .was lodged in
jail and yesterday morning Judge
January assessed a fine of $27.50
against the would-be sluth for carry
ing concealed weapons.
Patrolman Link executed a clever
piece of detective work yesterday
when he worked out the robbery of
Geo. Rassenfoss' bakery which occur-
red Saturday Dight. An entrance was
I effected to the store and the intruder
carried off a large quantity of goods.
.Jim Paton, an ex-convict, who was
employed in the bakery was suspceted
and Officer Link traced the goods to
the negro suburb of Claysville and
'placed Paton under arrest. In the
county court Squire Fretwell gave
Paton sixty days in jail at hard labor
for the offense and assessed a .fine of
$2U and costs for breach of the " peace,

Whistler's Sarcasm.
James McNeil' Whistler is said once
to have confronted Oscar Wilde at
