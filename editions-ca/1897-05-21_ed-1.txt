Xees Report on the Cuban SituationWashington May 20archives of the stateThe secretdepartmentthe island some ten months ago andI do not think it a fair inference todraw from existing conditions that thewar is approaching a termination because in pursuance of an establishedpolicy the insurgents avoid as far aspossible all serious engagementsThe impossibility of expelling theSpanish troops from this island byforce of arms is well known to themand they do not propose to risk thelives of their men and the success oftheir cause upon one or more pitchedbattles -I conclude therefore that thewar will drag its weary lengthalong so long as the insurgents candig sustenance from the ground onthe one side or money be obtained bythe other with the continued resultof untold human suffering loss

Uristowhas inaugurated a new policy as to theestablishment of post offices The lastadministration exercised a very conservative policy in dealing with thisquestion holding that there were already too many offices in operationand that it would be better as a general proposition not to have theoffices too close together Thepresent regime has determined toestablish offices wherever anyreasonable amount of businesscan be secured with the idea ofaccommodating as many people as possible While some attention is beingpaid to the rule that offices generallyshould not be closer together thanthree

unknown in those days and so long as reports and returns were regularly received at headquarters and no complaints came in from the civil authorises of negligence or indifference onthe part of their military backers allwent smoothly JSTow there had notbeen a few instances where civil andmilitary officials had clashed but CaptClose and his splendid company hadteen the theme of more than one laudatory report from the mai shal on thescore of what he heard from his deputies The general commanding indeedhad been much elated by high commendation from the highest power inWashington all due to services rendered in running down ivu Klux andbreaking up moonshiners by CaptClose of company G th infantryIts just exactly what the old dufferscut out for said the adjutant generalof the department but Im sorry tohave to see young Lambert sent intosuch exileHe could hardly have been sorrierthan Lambert was himself as thatyoung officer went briskly up the desolate road along the branch He hadnever seen a landscape so dismal in allhis life How on earth was he to employ his time No drills no roll callsno duties except the sending forth ofdetachments at the call of this fellowParmelee no books except the few inhis trunk no companions except thisheavy illiterate money grabbing loutwho did not know enough to offer him aseat or a cup of coffee after his longnight ride not a soul worth knowingnearer than Quitman and only the inebriate Fotts there Certainly MrNewton Lambert felt at odds with fatethis sunny December afternoon Hehad tried to persuade himself that thelaughable stories about Close weregrossly exaggerated but now that hehad met that officer the indicationswere in favor of their entire truthIt seems that Close had been on somedetached service in connection with theireedmenp bureau and had only joinedhis regiment late in the autumn of thememorable vellow fever vear whenhad he v desired he could have remained away His appearance at thetrieken garrison when the

unless they gave theirword on honor that they were notstriving to make a convenience of himBut the closest figuring he had everdone was that which he carried out forseveral months at the expense of a

warfare Hitherto it has been found a tiresome exercise to throw many handfuls of confettiespecially to a height of 12 or 15 feetAnd it is difficult for anyone but an expert to deliver this shower of

beinserted in this gun on the si v Thecharge was rammed down with a rodwhich forced a spring Then the bearer of the weapon awaited his opportunity When the queen of hearts or someother charming creature approached inher carriage he would aim at a pointabove her head press a trigger and loa rain of rubies emeralds and sapphireswould descend upon her and her suiteSo accurately could the

has been much usedIt is thrown up into the air as atile and often becomes entangled in thebranches of the trees along the boulevards But when thrown from thehand it does not go very far and it Inmore likely to miss than to hit the human target at which it is aimed Butthis year the spirobole has been introduced to aid one in managing thesoribbons The spirobole looks something like a crossbow without a bowthat is it is a light wooden gun witha long groove like that in which an air-row lies in a real crossbow There is astout rubber band which is pulled backand caught on a trigger A roll of ribbon is now laid Avhere the notched endof the arrow belongs One end of thestrip is made fast to the weapon andfloes not move The trigger beingpressed the rubber contracts like abowstring and away into space flies theroll unwinding as it goes A serpentine 100 feet long may thus be sent flying at a mark with great accuracy andin the twinkling of an eve A Frenchcontemporarj observes that the

anticipation of stirring times to comeYoure not going to take that child- svith 3rou said Mrs WarrickOf course said the colonel hesan the service and must take his chances-with the restBut vou could have left him behindYou are going to leave two trumpetersarent youYes but the Baby Trumpeter would-die of chagrin if he were one of them3Tes so glad that hes going to see real-service that he wanes to

Mrs WarrickOh yes Ill keep my eye on him-said the colonel Good by old ladyTheir hands met in a firm clasp ofxeal affection and good fellowshipGood by dear said Mrs WarrickGod bless you Come back with yourscalp or even without it only comeTwo months had passed and it -wasmow late in the summer The regimentwhat was left of it- was encampedon the banks of a narrow stream in Indian Territory The faces that the fire-light flickered on -were stern In frontof the colonels tent the colonel and hisr staff were supping together suppingon a small piece of bacon and a half cupof coffee apiece When the meal wasiinished the colonel told the Baby Trumjseter to sound the officers callk As the officers assembled JeoffrystookJiis stand behind the colonels chairand everyone waited to hear what thecolonel was going to sayGentlemen he began we havebarely enough food left to last with theutmost care two days longer The Seventeenth cavalry that was to have beensent to help us and to bring provisionsis doubtless now on the march but owing to our unexpected change of courseis marching in an exactly opposite direction Unless we can reach it we muststarve and to attempt to reach it issuicidal for as you know we are surrounded by more than ten times oursmmber of well armed Indians and our-ammunition is practically gone I wantiiny of you who can suggest anythingto do itFor a few moments silence reignedThen the Baby Trumpeter stepped upand salutedColonel he said let me go andbring the Seventeenth to 3rouThe colonel looked at him with a-growing sense of surprise on his faceWhy Jeoffrys he said its a perfectly wild idea And even if anyoneshould be reckless enough to undertake6uch a task it should be an old soldierone who has had experience with In-vdiansI have had experience with them fortwo months sir said Jeoffrys with agrinYes and you have done well saidthe colonel and Jeoffrys drew a quickbreath of gratification So well thecolonel went on that I dont want tothrow you away uselesslyJ3utl believe I could make it colonelsaid Jeoffrys Let me goYou dont realize the dangerYes sir I do but nothing venturenothing win and again JeoffrysgrinnedVery well Jeoffrys you may try itsaid the colonel I dont know that itis any pleasanter to be butchered in com-pany than alone and as butchery is apparently what awaits us all you maytake the lonely death if you chooseThank you sir said Jeoffrys as ifa great favor had been conferred uponliiniIn half an hour he was back again atthe colonels tent Teady to startWhat are your orders sir saidJeoffrysI have none saidthe colonel Then-as he loked at the eager handsome boydiis face softenedJeoffrys how old are you lie saidI enlisted as 21 and thats the onlyi lie I ever told colonel but I had to getlr the army I couldnt wait Ill be20 next month sir but please donttelljSeve r on my honor said thecolonelYou see sir said Jeoffrys myypaofcher had persuaded me not to acceptrJ - --cvan appointment to West Points when itwas offered to me Her only brotherwas in the army and was killed in anIndian campaign and she said shecouldnt bear to give me up but Icouldnt stand it I had wanted to be inthe army all my life so I ran awaj Icouldnt go off and leave her without aword but neither could I tell her whatI was going to do so I left a note for 1her 311st saying that I wanted to tryto make ray own way in the world andthat if I succeeded Id let her know andthat Id go back to see her anyhow inifive yearsDont you think that for her sake youought to give up this wild goose chasesaid the colonelSro sir for her sake I think Id better go on said JeoffrysShed be very proud of you if sheknew said the colonelOh colonel this isnt anything andshed be proud of me anyhow saidJeoffrys with a smile you know howmothers are sir Good by sirGood by said the colonel holdingout his handAnd Jeoffrys rode out silently into themoonless nightHe pushed on steadily through deserts through the narrow belts of woodthat edged the Avater courses across thealmost stagnant streams When dawnbegan to break he dismounted and ledhis horse into a tangle of brush on thebank of a little creek He loosened thegirths watered the horse and selecting a small partially open spot in thejungle settled down to spend the dayHe drowsed along until nearly noonwhen suddenly something not a noisehe was sure there was none but a senseof approaching danger brought him tohis feet and he saw through the leavessix Indians coining straigiit towardhim They were about 500 yards awayHe whispered down to his horse andowing to the ierfect training of ourcavalry horses down the creature wentJeoifrys crouched beside him a pistolin each hand The brush was so thicknear the ground that he could not seebut he could hear the Indians as theycame nearerAfter what seemed an interminablelength of time they were close besidehis hiding place He decided not tofire until they were upon him and theypassed by For a moment everythingwhirled before his eyes and then thetemptation to shoot came on him Itwas so strong that he had to lay downhis pistols and clinch his hands untilthe nails cut the fleshHe kept his horse down nearly all dayand started out again as soon as it wasdark At dawn he tied his horse andclimbed a tree to take a survey of thecountry and what should he see notthree miles off but the Seventeenthbaggage train and allThey had been concealed from himwhen he was on the ground by a sligiitelevation He scrambled down the treemounted and started toward the command shouting in a rush of exuberanceof spirits As he went down the otherside of the elevation he came face toface with three Indians who had beenhiding under bushes watching thetroopsIf Jeoffrys had been a boy up to thatminute it all died in him then It didnot occur to him to value his life forpersonal reasons all he wanted was toaccomplish what he had started out todo before he was killedWhen the troops came up for thefiring attracted them at once theyfound Jeoffrys horse dead two desperately wounded Indians lying on theground and Jeoffrys and the third Indian yelling and hopping around eachother the Indian trying to thrust hisknife into Jeoffrys and Jeoffrys tryingto lunge his saber into the IndianThe red men were soon disposed ofJeoffrys patted his dead horse good bywith honest sorrow mounted one of theSeventeenths led horses and the command started toward the camp underhis guidanceThe Indians had been keepingfaithf ulwatch but had made no attack on theirbagged game It had been their intention to starve them awhile and then tofall upon them torture and butcherthemThe men in camp were haggard andworn They had given up all hope ofrescue and when three days afterJeoffrys departure there was a suddenuproar among the Indians the readysoldiers turned to meet an onslaughtwith sublime recklessness and whilethey were in the thick of it they heardthe bugles of the Seventeenth callingencouragement promising quick relief Surely never had music been sosweet beforeThere was a sharp fight and whenthe remaining Indians were gallopingaway for their lives the Fourteenth andthe Seventeenth rushed into each othersarms The Baby Trumpeter was cheereduntil the heavens rang The men pulledhim from his horse and hugged him andthe colonels eyes were wet as he claspedthe young mans handYou have saved your regiment byrisking your own life my boy he saidwas he

not noticed that the blouseover his shoulder was saturated withbloodHes wounded shouted manyvoices and though the wound was onlypainful and not at all dangerous thetransformation of the boy into a lionwas completeThe homeward march was begunThey were two weeks oh the way andit was a weary time for Jeoffrys for hehad to travel in an ambulance and wasnot allowed to move about much forfear bis wound would opentVvHicks a private who rode with himand whose arm was broken told Baarrya corporal that he thought JeoffrysMas in love because he had often seenand revealed aspirit even in boyhood Hegathered a band of wild boys under hisleadership On one occasion when theycame together they found themselveson a greensward where a drove of rnagnilicant horses owned by one Tin Kinwas quietly pasturing Casen curtlyordered each to mount a courser asquickly as possible and to gain a neighboring plain at all speedThe tiny dwarf set the exampleSpringing- from the ground with greatagility he grasped a startled steed byits mane and by a skillful maneuver wason its back in an instant His comradesfollowed suit the ileet footed animalscharged ahead and soon all the Tartarboys were drawn up before their smallleader Here Casan without saddle orbridle put them through all the military exercises he could think of Ifwe should ever be called upon to go towar he remarked we should be foundsoldiers already trained for battle Atrue warrior should manage his courserby word or touch or even a glanceXow according to the Tartar codethe theft of a horse was punishable bydeath Tin Kin the owner of the herdsoon discovered that some of his choicestanimalswere missing and oil he startedin hot pursuit vowing vengeance on themiscreants lie soon came in sisht ofthe evil doers but his rage gave placeto astonishment when he found his superb steeds mounted by half grown children who were going through variousexercises under the command of adwarf Before he had time to speakCasan came charging to him sayingWe have not stolen your horses asyou may think These are my soldiersI wished to teach them to ride well andin order to do so I borrowed some ofyour coursers You who know theirvalue best can surely find nothingwrong in our actions on the contraryyou should be pleased to have your anijnals appreciated and I can assure youwe have found them worthy the highest9The owner was so talcen aback at thedwarfs harangue that for a momenthe stood speechless He soon howeverregained possession of his wits and exclaimed You appear to be a queercharacter Come to me with your comrades and we will talk the matter overtogetherThe little cavaliers wiHi one accordaccepted the invitation rode back to thetent of Tin Kin breakfasted with himand the result of it all was that a
