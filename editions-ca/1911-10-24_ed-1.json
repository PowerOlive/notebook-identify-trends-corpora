.Homes Come Near Economic
Ideal.
Farmers in Bourbon county build
"iheii dwellings at a cost within 3 per
fccsnt of an economic ideal recently
worked out by the statisticians of the
Farm Bureau of the Department of
Agriculture at Washington. That is
t;he average price of a farm house in
Bourbon county is 103 per cent of the
anrual income of the farm on which it
stands and from figures gathered all
over the United States the depart
ment has decided that if a house be
irailt for a sum equal to the annual
grcss income of its farm the mortgage
-evil will be reduced to a minimum and
t farm life be made correspondingly
'happier.
Under W. J. Spillman, chief of the
JFarm Bureau, the department has
been busy with the statistics with a
vuw to informing the farmers of tne
tinned States just how much they may
safily put into their farm houses.
Conditions in Bourbon county, the land
cf tjlrty, were reported by A. C. -Ball,
. vijllersburg, who was eDgaged in
e p rary work for the department.
IHe cast up the general county average
a"d ound it to be 103 per cent. His
istwe of the easy conditions and
.pre finable .returns yielded to the farm
ers around the city of Paris and his
information that they spent 103 par
cent, of their gross annual incomes on
their farm houses gave the depart
ment an excellent basis to work on.
When they had finished their investi
gations they found that the farmers of
Bourbon are only 3 per cent extrava
gant as builders, and that they have
almost solved the rpoblem of living at
a rate commensurate with their in
comes. In a word the economic build
ing judgment of the average Bourbon
county famer is iso nearly correct in
the opinion of EProf. Sillman and his
bureau that the wolf will never do
much howling around hi door.
Dentists Hold Meeting.

rerurning to Lexington after the latter
had made a buisness trip to this city,
and at the point near this city a

The force of the impact broke the
spokes out of the machine driven by
Mr. Wesbey, bending the steering gesr
so thnt the machine ran across the
road and plunged over an embankment.
They were climbing a steep hill and
moving along at a moderate rate of
speed when the accident occurred. Had
Mr Wesbey been going at a normal
rate of speed or had the accident oc
curred on a bridge a .short distance
away the occupants of the machine
would have been killed outright, but
as it was Doth escaped witr.out a
scratch. .
