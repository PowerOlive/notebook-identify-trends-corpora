Kaiser Still Thlnt Gttf Work.
' "Germany" Kaiatr. ex-Bourbonite,
is burning: up things in the major lea
gue, and playing; the same of his life
for the Cubs. He is hitting; the ball
good and hard and is running bases
and is showing a class that is making
the best of them set up and take no
tice. The Chicago Tribune in a recent
issue contained the folowing:
"Chance played a great game of
ball, and his pace was followed by
both Schulte and Kaiser: This latter
fellow has become inspired with that
championship spirit already, and, hav
ing recovered from any stage frigbt
he may have felt yesterday, he just
reveled in the game today and has im
pressed every one '"now as the hesfc
looking outfielder who is breaking into
iast company tms season.
"He can run around the bases as
fast as Zimmerman and seems to in
crease his speed with every stride. He
can go to third base and finish pulled
up where others would slide to second.
In the field he can cover as much
ground as Artie Hofman himself, and
lie can thro rr from any position and
shoot the ball in like a bullet. All he
needs is a bit of polishing in the finer
points of the game, and he'll get that
while doing bench duty."

Deaton's Slayer Held Under
Bond.
The examining trial of Ansn Wh;
and his wife, charged with the mur
der of Jason Deaton. closed at .Tnpksnn
j Tuesday and resulted in the defend
ants securing bond in thp sum nf
$5,000 each. They were not able to
give the bond required. '
There was great contrariety of tes-(
timony between the witnesses for the i
prosecution and the defense, the pros-1
ton was unarmed at the time he was
shot, while Anse White testified, and
was corroborated by two eye witnesses,
that Deaton fired on him first and that
he was only saved from being killed
by knocking down Deaton's pistol as
the latter fired at him.
