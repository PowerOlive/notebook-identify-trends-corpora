This"sizing" stunt consists of a sort ofmental following of the plan adoptedby the orange growers of California,who have a chute arranged with holesof various sized over which the orangesare rolled, each size finoing its particular hole and lodgment in a bin designed for it. The little fellows haveben eliminated already. Now the workis progressing on the men of mediumability, and pretty soon the mostpromising players will he "sized,"with the result that by tlu time theseason opens on April 12, a majorityof the useless material will imve beeneliminated, so that salaries will bepaid only to those who really can earnthem. The Cincinnati club nus eliminated some half dozen players already,and within the next two weeks willplace several more on the market, retaining extra men for experimentalpurposes in the pitching departmentonly. Other big league teams are following this same course, with the result that much promising, though undeveloped talent is being turned backto the minors for furthi seasoning.The interest in base ball is growingby leaps and bounds in every civilizedcommunity, is shown by the enormousdemand that is being made for reserved seats for the opening game in thiscity. More than ten thousand application are already in for reserved seatsand there are only about 5.UO0 suchseats to be had. Of course, there willbe room for all who may come to thisgame, to the number of 25,000 or more,but only 5,000 of these may securetheir seats in advance. It has not beenlong since a crowu of 15,000 at anopening game was considered a recordbreaker. Now 25.000 are expected onthe inside, and several thousand on the !outside of the pars when the first realbattle of the season takes place.

It isjust as unreasonable to expect the same results from thin, weak soil, in comparisonwith deep, rich soil, as it is to expect a child to do a man's work. This is a reasonable proposition, particularly to the scientific corn grower.More money is being spent and greater efforts along educational lines are beingmade to-day than ever before in the world's history to increase the yield of corn peracre. We contributed a very large effort to accomplish these results with our BlackHawk single kernel edge drop, and we now add to our combination the No. 15 Variable Drop, with which the drop can be changed to 2, 3 or 4 kernels in a hill withoutstopping the team: or can drill 7 1-2, 10 or 15 inches, 9, 12 or 17 1-2 inches, or 11, 14or 22 inches apart, without stopping the team.Hand Drop Attachment with jeach Planter, has Foot Drop also.

Jones -has accumulated a snugsum hunting up rascals. In otherwords, he is a detective. When wewere drinking our coffee and smokingI asked him to give me the most important case in which he had everbeen employed."You mean the most important tomy employer or to me?""Well, let it be the most importantcase to you.""All right. I'll give you the Williams case."I saw his wife look up at him, evidently with an intent to stop him, buthe told the story all the same."Mrs. Williams came to the office one day she was a widow andstated that something was occurringin her house she wished investigated.She possessed a number of valuablefamily jewels, which she kept in asafe imbedded in the wall on the second story of her dwelling. She aloneknew the combination, and 3et thejewels were gradually disappearing.She had a governess for her children,a Miss Elizabeth Ward, whom she suspected. I having been detailed on thecase, she was giving these facts tome. At this point I interrupted her."'I thought you said, Mrs. Williams,that you alone know the combination.IIow can Miss Ward open the safewithout it?'" 'Possibly in this way: She has abrother who is a skilled mechanic Inthe service of a safe and lock company, lie visits her frequently, and Isuspect that either he has instructedher in lock picking or she concealshim in the house and he watches hisopportunity to pick it himself unobserved.' "It struck me that to discover thetruth all she had to do was to watchand she would catch either Miss Wardor her brother stealing the jewels. Butif she preferred to pay a detective fordoing it I was quite willing. I w:sintroduced into the house as a nephewof Mrs. Williams, from a distant land,and. of course, to Miss Ward."I found the governess a very attractive young lady. Had I not feltvery sure she was an adventuress 1should have fallen in love with her.Indeed, I'm not sure but Don't liketo hear it, eh, dear? That's quitenatural. I'll switch off from that partof the story, though I'm sure you haveno reason to be jealous. Well, I tookup my residence for a few days or afew weeks, as the case might require,and was assigned a bedroom directlyopposite the safe in which the jewelswere kept"It didn't take me long to find outthat Miss Ward was as smart as asteel trap, and I made up my mindthat to catch her or her brother,which was the same thing I wouldhave to be awake every night in theweek. But she seemed worried. Withthe true detective instinct, I sawthrough that I inferred that herbrother was dominating her, compelling her to keep on with the thefts,while she feared this scheme would atlast be detected and one or both wouldspend a term In the state prison. Atany rate, she was worried."I remained awake all night for several nights in succession, and as I hadno excuse to remain in bed all day Igave up the plan of catching the thiefin the act and determined to try andworm myself into the confidence of.Miss Ward and see if I couldn't getthe secret from her. I found herquite willing to be courted and""Horace!" interposed Mrs. Jones."Pardon, my dear." Then to me: "Mywife can't bear to hear me speak ofmy premarital affairs.""Of course she can't," I chimed inwith Mrs. Jones, "now would youlike your wife to talk abont her ownpremarital affairs?""Urn! That's different. But to goon with my story. I didn't get muchfrom the governess, and while I wasmaking up to her Mrs. Williams reported that she had lost another jewel."Meeting Miss Ward after this theft,I found her in a very bad humor.Why I could not understand, for neither she nor any one else had beencaught stealing. She astonished meby coming out bluntly:" 'Mr. Detective, if you wish to findout who is stealing the jewels changeyour room.'"You could have knocked me downwith a feather. I knew I had met mymatch and answered never a word. 1went to Mrs. Williams and told her 1would take a room farther from thesafe. She give me one at the end ofthe hall where I could see withoutbeing seen, the light, which was keptburning low all night, being directlyover the s-ife."Time passed, during which I wasgetting impatient at xloing nothing,though 1 was not dissatisfied at beingkept in the house with Miss Yard.One night I heard a light tap at mydoor. Putting on a dressing gown, Iopened it. Miss Ward was standingin a dark corner and pointed towardthe safe. There stood Mrs. Williamsfumbling with the lock." 'She's asleep,' whispered MissWard."Mrs. Williams opened the safe, tookout something, closed the door andwent away. The mystery was solved.As a sleepwalker she was transferring her jewels from the safe to a tinbox in her bedroom closet""What became of Miss Ward?"

Y.A Bird That is Feared.The elster (Pica candata) is a birdthat is respected and feared throughout south Germany. It belongs to theraven tribe and is about the size of adove, with black and white feathersand long, pointed tail. It builds itsnest in orchards, and its life is sacred.If it is seen three times in successionon the same housetop in a place remote from its home it is believed to bea sure sign of death in that house. Ifit flies over a house where any one isill and gives its peculiar cry the sickperson is sure to die, but if it does notscream the patient may recover. It isbetter for the sick person if the birddoes not come near. No one could behired to bother these birds for fearthey might seek revenge, and if bychance one of them should die it is asign of bad luck to the owner of theproperty where it is found. Thebird is a valuable insect destroyer andin this way probably more than compensates for the fear it occasionsamong the farmers.Cursing In Korea.A strange way of cursing is that ofthe Korean. His ordinary swearwordis "Oenuma," or "lijou brute." TheJapanese have the same partiality forthis term of endearment But according to the Oriental Economic Reviewthe Korean considers himself especially abusive when he calls a person hischild or grandchild. When he wantsto call somebody down the Koreandemands hotly, "Are you not mychild?" And the angry retort is:"What! I your child? You are mygrandchild." Then the first goes astep further and cries, "You are agrandchild of my grandchild!" towhich the rejoinder is: "You conceited fellow! Have you forgotten thatyou are a grandchild of a grandchildof my grandchild?" When their vituperation reaches its climax the people of Chosen at last come to the occidental standard of exclaiming, "Yougrandchild of a dog!"Servants In Turkey.Turkey is not nearly so benighted aswe imagine, for there is no servantquestion there. Though slavery is stillrecognized, the kadun (mistress of thehouse) is a mother to her servants,whom she treats as children, and nochildren in the world are better treatedthan Turkish children. The most painful thing the kadun can do to a maidis to say: "The master has found agood husband for thee. Thou wilt bemarried at such and such a time.""Oh, mistress, what have 1 done tobo thus abandoned?" is the usual sorrowful response.Even after the servant's marriage thekindly relations between mistress andmaid continue. There are no fixedservant wages in Turkey. Faithfulservants are rewarded from time totime in accordance with their masters'or mistresses' good pleasure or circumstances. Chicago Journal.Orinin of Dukes.The word duke comes from the Latin"dux," a leader, la early Saxon timesthe commanders of armies were calleddukes i. e., the leaders of the soldier'.In other words, the first -duke was thefirst best fighting man. No regard washad to ancestry or present attainmentsor any other sort of thing beyond thesimple matter of warlike efficiency.Naturally the leader of the fightingwould when the fighting was over comein for the lion's share of the spoils and"honors," and naturally again the restof the folks would "look up" to him,and by degrees his superiority wouldbe imparted to his family, and a "nobility" would spring iuto bein.
