Our people had the pleasure of en
joying one'of the best entertainments
at the M. F. C. chapel Friday evening
ever held in Millersburg. It was a
concert company which was secured on
account of an off night after playing
inParis Thursday. The company con
sisted of a violinist, pianist and accom
.panist. It was of a high order, the
numbers were larcrely classical and
well executed. Mr. Jules Falk, vio
3inst, was the star of the evening, and
in him the people were not disap
pointed. His numbers were well chos
en, tones faultless.
Please bear in mind that we cannot
live on'promises. It takes money to
aneefc cur obligations. Your account is

THEATRICAL.
An early engagement here that is
certain to prove highly interesting to
all lovers of the better things in the
lino of theatrical offerings is the ap
pearance of the A born Opera Com
pany, of upwards of ono hundred
Deonle in'a sumntuous and stupendous
production of Balfe's best opera. "The
Bohemian Girl." j
The Hoey Musical Comedy Co., op
ened a week's engagement at the
Grand last night to a big house and
judging from ihe amount of applause it
must have pleased. The bill was a
"Military Girl." a rollicking musical
comedy with lots ofilife and plenty of
catchy muibic. Tne company consists of
fourteen members. The costumes
are very'prettv and the chorus is very
well drilled. The bill for tonight is
"A Day at the Race Track," and has
never been shown in Paris.
WALTER JONES IN 'BABY MINE."
"Baby Mine," Margaret Mayo's
laughing success, which had a run of
a solid year at Daly's Theatre in New
York, is announced as the attraction
which conies to the Paris Grand Wed
nesday. Januarv 29, with Walter Jnnes
and the New York company under the
management of William A. Brady.
Few comedies are as continuously fun
nvas."Baby Mine," which literally
has a laugh in every line." How
exquisite the pleasure one derives in
seeipg'this roaring corned', which has
made such a Dronounced success in the
United States and London. There is
an ecstacy that mothers ieel as the
many amusing conditions and numer
ous complications come in the play,
and the possibilities of which they can
understand. Ihe fun and laughter
which prevail throughout, act like a
gleam of sunshine in a low sky on the
audience. The complex situations
which induce such vehement outbursts
of laughter and screams of delight,
and the sensational and ludicrous an
tics of the young husband, when he
first fondles and talks to his first born,
excite the emotion a..d memory of
many who have experienced similar
moments. The plav, from start to end,
provokes a shaft of penetrating humor
and pleasure.
"THE SERVANT IN THE HOUSE."
There is a strain of rnetaohysics in
"The Servant in the House." the re
markable pluy which is to be pre
sented at the Paris Grand on Monday,
January! 27. by Victor E. Lambert
and his associate players which Merle
II. Norton has bat ded together as
the greatest company cf actors ever
sent out of New York. It may be
said to preach a gospel somewhat
akin to Christian Science when Man
son, the Chril-like figure, tells Mary
that "everything comes true if you

VANT IN THE HOUSE."
wish'hard enough." And when Rob
ert, the Drain Man, the great rough
man who Dominates so many of the
scenes of the play, tells her he does
n't believe in "no fairy tales like
that," she replies, "I don't believe
there's anything else in the world if
we only knew. And that's why I'm
wishing. I'm wishing now. I'm
wishing' hard." Then it is th3t the
Drain Man makes reply, "So am 1,
Gawd 'elp me."
300 Per Cent. Realized on Crop.
That the tobacco glowers ot Centra
Kentucky are this year certainly re
ceiving big returns for their crops was
illustrated by the fact that during the
past week J. F and V. K. Dodge it
ceived $11,088 for the croo of forty
acres The land was loueht some time
ago'at approximately $100 per acre, so
that leaving aside tie rot of labor the
crop in one year bought nearly 300
per cent on the ciiginal investment?
The crop averaeed 1.54U pounds tot i
acre making a total cf 61.600 pouncs.
J The tobacco averaged 18 cents a
pound, and was raised on Hillside
stock farm, owned ry the Messrs.
Dodge, three ard one-half miles from
Paris on the North Middletown pike.
The forty acres of giound on which
the crop was raised was formerly
used as a trair.h g track Lfor rtotting
horses.
