TON M00RE "HOLD YOUR HORSES"
The best acting Tom Moore has ever done and the best Tom Moore picture ever made.
You have seen Tom Moore iri various roles. You have seeniiim as a languid member of the English peerage, as a New
York cop, as an amateur detective, as a small town politician, as a chauffeur and as pjain Tom Moore, witn the winnmgflrish
smile and the Blarneying eyes. Now behold him him in his greatest role an Irish street cleaner who rises step by step to be
the greatest political power in New York. We will say and no one who has ever seen "Hold YourHorses" will contradict
us that there is not another star on the screen today who could play "Canavan" like Tom Moore plays him
