Vanderbilt, in Paris, removes the head of agreat railroad family. Since thedeath of the "Old Commodore" Cornelius, who founded the fortunes ofhis family by running a ferry fromhis home in States Island to NewYork City, and who later turned toshipping and railroads, the Vanderbilts have been known as a familyrather than by the achievements ofany individual. They are commonlyreputed to be the richest family inAmerica. Although the wealth ofmany individual exceeds that of anysingle Vanderbilt, there are alwaysmany Vanderbilts, all of them wealthy and much in the public eye.William K. Vanderbilt succeededin due course to the control of theNew York Central in the footstepsof his grandfather, his father, William H.,.and his older brother, Cornelius. None of the sons or grandsons has shown the genius of the"Old Commodore" in establishingnew enterprises, but the three familyleaders since his death have provedwise conservers and guardians of theproperty he created. All of themhave "worked at their job" and acquired practical training for railroading from the inside of the offices of the Ceneral and in somecases in its shops. William K. Vanderbilt was brought home from Europe at nineteen and set to work asa clerk in the treasurer's office. Hislast active connection with the roadwas as president when A. H. Smithwas drafted by the Federal RailroadAdministration to be regional director of all the roads here.William K. Vanderbilt has? alsobeen active in sports and in socialaffairs on both continents. It wassoon after his marriage to his firstwife, now Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont,that he gave "the Vanderbilt ball"which was talked about the countryover and was credited with wideningthe portals of New York "Society"so that the Vanderbilts and theirfriends were included. Later hisdaughter, Consuelo, married theDuke of Marlborough. His cup hasbeen filled and running over withworldly success and yet he is quotedas saying a few years ago: "My lifewas never destined to be quite happy. It was laid along lines which Icould not foresee almost from earliest childhood. It has left me withnothing to hope for, nothing definnite to seek or strive for. Inheritedwealth is a big handicap to happiness. It is as certain death to ambition as cocaine is to morality."Strange as that judgment soundsfrom that source, it is the voice ofexperience and is an arresting judgment as to the handicap of wealth.Baltimore News.A MATTER P0R REFLECTIONMany people are wondering whatbecomes of all the young womenstenographers who are turned outevery year by the high and commercial schools.

And business mencomplain that a large part of themare not well trained in their work.Unless they gain added proficiencyby using their shorthand" most of.the time, they soon loSe speed andcorrectness. Then they may not beboss is yelling to the school superintendent for another. Possiblythis explains where they all go to.Young women who are ambitiouslor permanent business success needa more thorough course than theschool usually give.

(adv)OflLYA SPORTSMAN KNOWSJOYS OF FISHING"Study to be quet" was the fin-ilrdmonishment to his pupils made-byIzaak Walton.As one racns over the rails in thePullman or whizzes over the bridgein he touring car, these days perhaps he sees sitting silently andcontemplatively on a stream bank rperson, rcd'oi "pole" in hand. Heis a sphinx, the picture of silence,as silent as the breath of dawp.He's 'a brothei of the fisherman'seJan. Chances aie he knows Ilttliof the advice so kindly given byIzaak 300 years ago, but he knowsthat if he doesn't keep quiet he isn'tnearly so likely to catch fish. And1 hat's what he's after. .There's a difference between afisherman and an. angler. This fellow was a fisherman, pure and simple. He called it a "pole." If he'dbeen an angler he'd called it a"rod." He was out after meat. Butas all 'in fishing is not entirelycatching fish, a change is comingover men who practice the game.And the sport is just now comingLnto the 'first flush of its glory forthis season.A famous newspaper man sayjthat ihe true angler does not measure his success by the size or thenumber of the fish he catches, forhis days are always full of profitable pleasures. "To him every min-iute in the woods or on the watersoffers something of interest, whether it be merely watching the wildpeople of the forest, the sunsets andi lhe suniiSes, the starrynnap overhead at night or 'listening to thecall of the birds, the wind in thetrees or the musical lap of waters."oKENTUCKY IN BETTER SIRES;BETTER STOCK -MOVEKentucky, has been officially admitted into "the "better sires, betterstock" campaign, conducted by theUnited States Department of Agricultuie, and efforts will be made toimprove the quality of the stock inthe State by substituting purebredsires for "scrubs."

Thecessation of he demand for coarseo-rades of wool for army uniformsand the refusal of average people, inspite of the high cost of living, tobuy clothing made of ttfe coarsegrades, has left Argentina with morethan 200,000,000 pounds of almostunsalable wool on its hands, according to a local manufacturer of woolen cloth, interviewed by La Nacion.This quantity will be increasedduring the shearing season in Julyand August. As the production ofwool in this country is growing yearby year, the problem of selling thecoarser grades is considered veryserious.One reason for the situation isthat formerly Argentine sheep breeders had thought more of the meatthan the wool, with the result thattheir stock became mixed and theconsequent wool coarse and not uniform.

Shirley, 315 Segur avenue, Toledo, Ohio who has beenemployed by Birkirayr-Rodernich-ShbwellCompany, hardware dealers, for sixteen years."Until I began taking Tanlac lastwinter I had suffered from rheumatism in my arms, shoulders and theback of my neck every winter forten years. Seldom a day passedduring the winter months all theseyeais that l did not suiter intenserain, and my condition would get sobad I could not stoop over withoutsuffering agony and at times wasunable to do a lick of work. Oftenmy arms -would get so stiff and themuscles so painful that I could notraise my hands to my head. My appetite was extremely poor, I seldomate any breakfast and my digestionwas so bad everything I ate disagreed with me. I was also troubleda lot with catarrh, got up everymorning with my head all cloggedup and feeling simply terrible, nfact, I Nas in a miserable conditionand about as badly run-down as anyone ever gets to be and keep going."Last winter a fuend who hadtaken Tanlac for rheumatism withfine results advised me tc try it.Well, sir, I took his advice, ana in ashort while was entirely fiee of allihe agony and pain I had sufferedfor so many yeais, as there was notthe slightest sign of rheumatismleft in my shoulders, arms andneck. I now have a splendid appetite, eat anything I want and amneer troubled with indigestion, anathe catanh has hardly been noticeable since I started taking Tanlac.At the beginning of cold weatherthis winter, I had a slight touch ofrheumatism again, but I started taking Tanlac, and after taking only afew doses it left me and I haven'thad a sign' of it since. I expect totake a little Tanlac every wintei,for I find it not only keeps offlheumati&m, but I eat, sleep andfeel better in every way. Tanlac issuiely due a good word from me after what it has done for me, and Inevei miss an opportunity of tellingotheis about it."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the Peoples Pharmacy.

Rewards amounting to $67,200 will bepaid by the War Department for information that will lead to the arrestof 1,344 "slackers" or draft dodgersin the State of Kentucky, who arecharged by the department with failure to respond to the country's call.The local police departments ofthe various cities, the military intelligence divison of the War Department, and the bureau of investigation of -the War Department willtake an active part in the dragnetwhich will virtually cover the Statein the hunt for the draft deserters.The list of the names of these1,344 Kentucky draft deserters willbe made public in a few weeks, itwas announced Wednesday. Thenames are being carefully checkedin an effort to make' sure that thesemen failed to answer the draft call,and to avoid any possibility of error.The personnel divisions of the navyand marine corps are checking upagainst the names to see if any ofthe men whose names appear -on thelist served in those branches of theservice.As soon as this list has been checked the names will be given to thenewspapers by the War Departmentfor publication. The names of menin each community also will be posted in the local postoffice.For months the War Departmenthas been preparing a mammoth listoi names of men who can be classedbeyond question as actual draft deserters, and it is expected the totalwill be above 100,000 for the wholecountry. The entire , nation, including every agency of the Federal,State and local authorities, will becalled uppn by the War Departmentto assist in the roundup."There is a remote; possibility,"said one official, "that a few of themen whose names appear on theslacker list may have served in somebranch of the service without knowing it. If such is the case, he willbe given an opportunity to appear atthe War Department or before thelocal representatives of the department and show that he did serve, inwhich event he will be given a cleanrecord. But where he is unable toshow that he served his countrywhen called he will be subject to amilitary courtmartial and a severepenalty will be imposed."XXLTabletJfoxmOnly5-4 -'il::1XOtakefZZttDO NOT ACCEPT SUBSTITUTES!OH MY STOMACHViMiSnCount the Needless FootstepsAn Extension Would SaveHow about the time lost by you and youroffice force in running to the telephone?Not only the lost time and lost energy,but the prolonged interruption from workwhich one or more extensions, convenientlyplaced, would sav$ for you.Most offices have expanded and we arenow able to furnish extension telephones inconnection with your present service.The cost is only a few cents a week.
