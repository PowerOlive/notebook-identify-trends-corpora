The serious consequences to which Scrofula surely leads
should impress upon those afflicted with it the vital im

not possibly effect a ore la many eases where the wrong
treatment has been relied upon eomplieated glandular
swellings have resulted for which the doctors insist that
a dangerous surgical operation is necessary
Mr H Thompson of M illedgerille Ga writes 1
bad case of Scrofula broke out on the glands ef my neck
which had to be lanced and caused me much suffering I
was treated for a long while but the physicians were un
able to cure me and my condition was as bad as when I
began their treatment Many blood remedies were used
but without effect Some one recommended 8 S 8 and
I began to improve as soon as I had taken a few bottles

COMPASS AND THE GROWING
USE OF ELECTRICITY
A Danger That the Magnetic Neeale
May Be Rendered Practically TJe
IeM to the Mariner and the Sur
veyorA Curiow Discovery
Although the invention and introduc
tion of the trolley system of street rail
ways have been of inestimable valne to
oivilization it has incidentally wrought
some harm here and there Emphasis
was laid on one of these drawbacks to
electric traction in the address delivered
by Professor A W Bucker at a recent
meeting of the British Association For
the Advancement of Science
In various parts of the world observa
tories have been established for the par
pose of keeping track of the changes in
the direction in which the magnetic
needle points It was long ago discov
ered not only that the compass does not
aim directly at the north pole but that
the amount of variation in its indica
tions from true north undergoes slow
alterations Hence it is necessary to
mako fresh charts showing the varia
tion for different parts of the globe
every few years But in order to get
the data for such corrections of the
highest importance to the surveyor and
mariner it is reqmisite that careful ob
servations be made continuously at a
number of widely separated points
Two of the most famous and hitherto
useful institutions of this class are situ
ated in Washington in the grounds of
the naval observatory and in Toronto
The interference of the electric currents
that run through the earth and the
track of trolley lines which have been
constructed near these observatories in
terfere so much with the behavior of
the instruments of both places that the
records now obtained are practically
worthless And the experts are greatly
puzzled by the problem of escaping from
this vexatious interruption of their
work
So delicate are the influences which
the magnets in such an observatory are
intended to investigate that they can be
perceived only when the apparatus is
most scrupulously guarded The room
in which they are mounted is under
ground Visitors are never admitted ex
cept under unusual circumstances and
are required to deposit their jaokknives
keys and all other metallic objects about
their persons before entering the apart
ment The magnets generally bars of
steel not over eix inches long are poised
above a scale that is graduated to the
most minute fractions and a telescope
on an adjacent pillar is used to read
the fluctuations which are too small to
be discernible by the unassisted eye A
tiny mirror as big as a dime catches a
beam of light more slender than the
lead in a pencil and reflects it away to
a sheet of slowly moving photographic
paper on whioh a permanent reoord is
made The arrangement of the apparatus
is such that the movement of the mag
net is magnified many times in the reo
ord in order to render the changes per
ceptible
There are three sets of instruments
on duty in such an observatory One
swings horizontally like a mariners
compass Another dips up and down
A third is designed to measure the in
tensity of the earths magnetism whioh
is a separata thing from the direction
in which it acta And so sensitive are
they that their readings are apt to be
interfered with by exceedingly trivial
causes It is customary for the superin
tendent to inscribe en the scroll Viei

i the aftetteti e feantftBJitijta
f its meaning will be excited Tssrlfc
mind of the scientist who aftorwjtsA -amines
the photographic trace
In spite of the delicacy of the appa
ratus it may seem surprising to the lay
mind that the passage of trolley cur
rents at a distance of many rods from
the observatory should be able to affect
the instruments within But they do
and it is impossible to separate in the
record the variations produced by genu
ine changes in terrestrial magnetism
from those which are caused by the

trolley Professor Rucker said a few
days ago From all parts of the world
we hear of observatories ruined or
threatened by the invasion of the elec
trical engineer Toronto and Washing
ton have already succumbed Potsdam
Pare St Maur Greenwich and Kew are
besieged and the issue largely depends
upon whether these great national ob
servatories can or cannot make good
their defense t
Although the practical service to
mankind which is rendered by institu
tions of this class is alone sufficient to
justify their maintenance and to war
rant alarm as to their future there are
other questions involved which possess
profound interest for the philosopher
We know that the earth is a magnet
but as yet no one is able to say what
makes it so The fundamental secret of
terrestrial magnetism has not been
solved Then too there are various
changes in direction which mark the
behavior of the needle that remain to
be explained What influence is it that
makes the needle swing to and fro to a
microscopic extent every day Why is it
that the diurnal swing is greater in
years of sun spot abnudauee than at the
minimum stage of solar activity Why
do the indications of the needle differ
in summer from those of winter What
is the key 10 tne mystery of the long
I period movement that makes it neces
sary to rechart the situation What
causet tne convulsive behavior of the
magnets fpt a few hours or days when
i there is a great outbreak of sun spots
j And ie there any relation between the
weather aud the fluctuations in the
earths mafiietism There are theories
j on tbes subjects but no generally
j cepted doctrines and the human mind
is so constituted that it will not rest
until further light is obtained New
