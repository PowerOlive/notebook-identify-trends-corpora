The wives, daughters and sisters
of Paris men will soon be "at it" ;f
they are not already "at it." By "at
it" means, of course,-housecleaning.
It is yain to admit that the mas
culine gender loves the neutral gen
der' of the house torn and twisted.
It is almost too much to admit that
the masculine gender loves' the fem
inine gender in a frowsy old cap and
seen through a mist of dust. But it
has to he endured and those of us
-who can make our hearts work under
the circumstances should be sympa
thetic to the feminine of the specTW
this ordeal of hers. It isn't easy?
work, and no matter how the male
person himself may feel about it at
the end of an imperfect day, it's
prettv safe to say that she seeks her
pillow with tired li,mbs nnd aching
nmscles. Don't make her slumber
worse by tantilizing her with your
own grouchy remarks about the
inconveniences her poor, doleful hus
band .suffers.
Woman is instinctively an artist.
She likes beautiful things more
than you do, man. You may dislike
to come home to a house that has
"been through battle, but not half as
much as she does. Housecleaning is
a. necessity, an absolute, total neces
sity, and she knows it- She knows
ft knows that your health and your
oofrnfort depends on it. She knpws
that the children's health depends
en it. She knows that the making
mt a home (the greatest word in the
.taglish language) depends on it.
jkm' she housecleans, God bless her,
-wfcether man storms or approves.
