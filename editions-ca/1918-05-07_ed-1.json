SWINDLERS' TRICK TAKES MON
EY SENT TO SOLTirR-RS
Relatives and friends of several
soldiers in army camps have been
victimized by swindlers who wired
or wrote for funds under soldiers'
names. In each instance it was re
quested that money be sent by wire
waving identification, or by mail to
general delivery, the customary ex
planation being that the soldier had
been discharged and would have no
way of securing identification, nor
of getting mail addressed to his com
pany. T-he following is a typical tele
gram, sent to the father of a soldier
in a southern camp:
"Have been discharged. Coming'
home. Going -to Atlanta through
country to-night. Please wire me
$6 at Atlanta so I may pay for
uniform and come home direct. Wave
identification as I am not known in
Atlanta. Wire cash quick so I can
get home to-morrow morning."
Before being complied with, any
request for money to be sent under
.such conditions should'be verified by
a letter or telegram to the command
ing officer of the camp in which the
man whose name is signed to the re
quest is stationed.
ADDRESSES WILL AGAIN APPEAR
IN CASUALTY LISTS.
The War Department will resume
almost immediately the practice of
giving addresses of American soldiers
named in the casualty lists sent from
j France. .
rne aecision was matte by Presi-
dent Wilson, to whom the public ap
pealed when the addresses were or
dered discontinued. The President
took up the subject! with Secretary
Baker immediately after the Secre
tary's return from France.
Publication of addresses was dis
continued March 8. Explaining at
the time why the order was issued,
the War Department"" said publica
tion gave information to the enemy
and also "brought swarms of claim
agents to harass relatives of men
killed. ' ' '
The President took the subject up
when the Committee, on Public In
formation 'refused to handle the list
on the grounds that the names with
out addresses were valueless for pub
lication purposes.

TRYING TO BEST CANTRILL
Congressman James Campbell
Cantrill will have no opposition in
his own party for re-election, but it
is said that a young barrister to for
tune and fame unknown, one E. N.
Casey, of Lexington, will be chosen
by the Republicans to pit against
him. He must be a very green and
unsophisticated youth to permit him
self to go up against such sure de
feat as awaits him. He should have
been warned by the fate of one R.
Lee Murphy and others who butted
their heads against J. Campbell.
Mr. Cantrill.'s unwavering support I
of President Wilson s plans and his
splendid service in Congress entitles
him to the support of every patriot
and the leaders of the Republican
party should see that he is returned
unopposed.
Doubtless the Lord's self-appointed
partner, the Kaiser, would insist
that his friends were doing a pious'
duty in, crucifying those Belgian
nuns.

SOLDIERS ABROAD OBSERVE MAY
12 AS MOTHER'S DAY
"Mother's Day" a day on which
every soldier of the American expe
ditionary forces, young and old, high
and low, is exepcted to write home
to mother has been fixed far May
12. The idea originated with the
Stars and Stripes, the official news
paper of the American forces in
Europe, and was approved by head
quarters, which is doing everything
possible to help it along.
The postoffice is rising to the oc
casion,, and the Young Men's Chufe
tion Association has promised that
on that date its huts will be stocked
with an inexhaustible supply of yrit
ing paper. The censors have decided
to work overtime, until midnight if
necessary, so that the letters will be
speeded to the United States without
delay.
The experience of the army post
office has taught that the mothers
come first in the soldiers' thoughts,
and so has decided to make every
possible effort that every mother in
America whose son is in France shall
receive tidings from her "boy." Thus
the date especially set apart for the
purpose.
Mothers may expect their letters
to begin arriving early in June. Sol
diers in the front-line trenches will
be given every opportunity to scrib
ble a few lines to their mothers,
which will be hurried to the rear and
rushed along to their destination.
All other business will be put aside
except that of fighting the Germans.
On that day the mothers will be up
permost in the minds of the soldiers.
The letters will be marked "Mother's
Letter" on .the envelopes and will be
given preference over all other mail
matter.

WITHOUT RIFLE AMERICAN
E3LIS FULL ARMED FOE. . .
Two interesting letters from Cor
poral Arthur C. Traylor, of Freeport,
L. I., a member of the One Hundred
and Sixty-fifth Infantry of the Rain
bow Division, and one of the first
American soldiers wounded in.
France, has reached this country.
One was to his- father and the other
to his sister, Mrs. Frederick Menke,
of 930 St. Nicholas avenue.
Young Trayler was wounded in
February and his letters were writ
ten the middle of last month from the
J hospital where he is recovering. He
gives an excellent idea of the spirit
of the Americans in France. He
wrote that although he had thirteen
shrapnel wounds he was feeling pret
ty fair, aind that he was even then
counting the days before he would
be able to get back in the trenches.
In the letter to his sister Trayer
tells of a hand-to-hand struggle he
witnessed between a big six-foot lad
from Ohio and a German. "In some
way," Trayer wrote, "the Ohio boy
lost Iris rifle in climbing out of a
trench. A husky German was almost
on top of him with his bayonet when
he suddenly took off his helmet and
shied it at the Germain's head. The
Htrn ducked and before he knew
what had happened the big boy was
on top of him. In no time at all he
had that bayonet away from the
German and he got his man."
Corporal Trayer said" both French
and American surgeons had operated
on. him and that at tliB time he was
writing they had extracted all but
one piece of the shrapnel. He ad
ded they expected to remove that the
-next day:

92 CENTS AN HOUR EARNED BY
GARDENERS IN OHIO.
One large manufacturing concern
in Ohio provided gardens for its em
ployes in 1817, and required them to
keep an accurate record of the time
spent working the gardens and the
value of the crop grown.
At the end of the season the results
showed that the gardeners had re
ceived 9 2 cents an hour for their
spare time spent in the gardens.
Another large manufacturing con
cern in Illinois plowed up a prize 40
acre alfalfa field and divided it into
garden plots for the use of its em
ployes. The results obtained from
this garden plot far exceeded the ex
pectations of both the company and
its employes.
Manufacturers all over the country
are providing gardens for their em
ployes this year, according to reports
to the United States Department of
Agriculture.
