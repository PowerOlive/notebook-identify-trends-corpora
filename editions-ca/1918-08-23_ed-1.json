DEMOCRATS TO ORGANIZE
THE FALL CAMPAIGN.
FOR
With the primary over, steps will
soon be taken to organize for the
Democratic fall campaign and the
election of the party nominees for
United States Senator, Congressmen
and Judges of the Court of Appeals.
The Democratic State Committees
will be called to meet in the near
future to name the campaign com
mittee and formulate plans for the
party fight, but nothing will be done
until Senator Ollie M. James express
es his wishes regarding the selection
of a campaign chairman and com
mittee, as the party leaders unite in
saying that he should have the most
to say in this matter. It is expected
that when Senator James recovers
sufficiently from his illness that has
confined him in a Baltimore hospital
for several months, he will either
come to Kentucky and take part in
the selection of the campaign or
ganization, or indicate his wishes in
that respect. There is nopurpose to
do anything in this respect until
Senator James is heard from.

crowded trains and unsatisfactory
conditions on trains, but that these
things were due to the great demand
upon the railroad systems for troop
movements and transportation of
coal, food, raw materials and other
supplies required for military operations.

campaigns will be begun in each

gone. These new members are to be

main active in Sunday School work,

whose place they are taking comes
