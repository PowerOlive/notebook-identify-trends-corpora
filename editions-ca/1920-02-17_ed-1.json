WIGGINS HARBER.
Friends, acquaintances and rel
atives of the charming bride in this
immediate vicinity wjere pleasantly
surprised recently when messages
were received here announcing the
marriage of Miss Rachel Wiggins, of
raris, to Mr. Overton Harber, of
Richmond.
The ceremony was performed last
Thursday afternoon at the Christ
Church Cathedral, in Cincinnati by
the rector, in the presence of a few
witnesses, intimate friends of the
principals. Mr. Harber and Miss
Wiggins had been victims some time
ago of Cupids' darts and it was the
general impression that their mar
riage would take place some time
this month.
The bride is one of the most pop
ular young women of Bourbon
"Friends here were greatly inter
ested and surprised to learn of the
wedding of Mr. Overton Harber, of
this city, and Miss Rachel Wiggins,
of Paris, which was solemnized at
Cincinnati, Thursday. Mr. Harber
had taken but few into his confi
dence. A host of friends and loved
ones will extend hearty congratula
tions to this popular young business
man. He has been connected with
the sales forces of the Kellogg Co.
for several, years. His fair bride is
one cf the most attractive women of
Bourbon county, of a prominent
familv there and beloved by all. She
will be given a cordial welcome to
Richmond."

SMITH.
Death again entered the home
of Mr. and Mrs. Jos. A. Smith, re
siding on the Jackstown pike, near
Paris, Friday, and claimed a third
victim, their daughter, who had
been seriously ill for several days
of pneumonia, succumbing to the
disease. Two brothers died a few
days ago within a few hours of each
other, and the sister died a short
lime after their bodies were inter
red in the Paris Cemetery- The sis
ter's body was interred on the fam
ily lot by the side of her brothers.
Saturday morning. The mother and
two children are very ill with the
same malady. , , ... . ,
The Save-a-Life League, in pub
lishing its collection of figures on
suicide, remarks that journalism is
a profession the members of which !
are content to let nature take its !
course. Lawyers, doctor?- and teach- t
ers shake off the coil, but newspaper i
men are free from the piania.
The newspaperman has to be I
cheerful and patient. Once in the
profession he works constantly and .
his thoughts are largely occupied
with matters beyond his own for
tunes. He has no time for a dan
gerous amount of introspection. He
studies too many people to take any
one, including himself, too seri
ously. Life is pretty much a joke
but it is good to be here, he reasons.
Then, too, there is the other side
of the story. Newspaperpnen are
often called upon to be the first to
tell those left behind the first news
of a suicide. Their intimate knowl
edge of the shock, the grief and the
distress which are caused make
them respect the commandment.
Finally, "suicide" is lying down on
an assignment.
SirOliver Lodge has been telling
New York audiences lately that the
messages from "suicides" beyond
ihe veil are that they are continually
distressed that they ended their
lives.
o
It has just about gotten so in thi?
country that when a man figures on
building a house his face gets so
ioflg his chin rubs his vest buttons.
The mechanical excellence, ease of control and
remarkable riding comfort of the SERIES 20 SPECIAL

wheel and feel the responsiveness of its flexible motor to
your slightest touch.

JEFFEKSON DAVIS AND ALBERT
SIDNEY JOHNSON TRAN
SYLVANIA GRADUATES
Tt is not generally known, but it
is a fact, that Jefferson Davis and
Albert Sidney Johnson, who played
such a prominent part in the war
between the sections from 1SG1 to
1865, were graduates in the same
class from Transylvania College.
These young men entered Transyl
vania at the same time, were gradu
ated -the same day, left Lexington
for ?.Vst Point, where the founda
tion of their military careers were
laid, at the same ti;me. These a-nd
other interesting facts have been,
learned from an inspection of orig-
inal records in the old library of
Transylvania, for which the college
will conduct a campaign April 21
to May 2, to place it in a fireproof
' building. Transylvania expects to
j raise $588,124 this year and a toiai
of more than two and, a qiiarter
, J millions of dollars in the next five
t years to place the Institution in the
