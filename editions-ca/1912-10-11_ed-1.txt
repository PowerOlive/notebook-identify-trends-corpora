WOODROW WILSON,of New Jersey.For Vice-President,HON. THOS. R. MARSHALL,of Indiana.For Congress,HON. J. CAMPBELL CANTRILL,of Scott county.Up to the People.The present campaign for the election of a Democratic President differsfrom all others in recent years. Heretofore the money necessary for the expenses was supDlied by men of largemeans, who were anxious for the success of the party, and maybe, in somecases, from those who thought theycould use it to their own advantage.This order of things has been changed. Governor Wilson has ahsolutelyrefused to accent contributions fromcorporations, great interests or otherquestionable sources, determined, ifelected, to take the high office withclean hands and under obligation tonone save thcgreat common people.The necessaryexpense3 of the Presidential campaign are very great.Money is needed to provide speakersand literature to inform the voters ofthe issues of the campaign. Thismoney must come, ifat all, from thepeople who now have the opportunityto return to their own. The other parties are being financed bv the interestsas "usual. The Democratic partymust depend on its members who areearnestly solicited to contribute to theextent of their means or inclinations.A dollar, if you can afford no rnore ; ahundred ora thousand, if you are ableand anxious that the people shall rule.Send any amount that tbe spirit movesyou to the Secretary, Hon. W. O.Davis, of the Democratic State CamDaign Committee, Tyler Hotel, Louisville, and it will be promptly acknowledged. The time is short, the demandis urgent. Remember the old adage,"He gives twice who gives quickly,"and send your contribution at once.Great Opportunity.Never did the great common peoplehave such a chance to come to theirown as now. The big interests havefor years been financing- thejcampaignsand then claiming the right to dictateto the successful candidate, in whichthey have.generally been successful.Governor Wilson positively refusesto acceptany of their money, but islooking to the people to furnish thenecessary funds for the expenses of hiscampaign, so thai when elected he eantake the office amenable to none butthem.In hiB splendid address to tlie editorsj at Louisville last Saturday, CnaiimanJohnson N. Camden, of the Democratic Campaign Committee, laid specialepmhasis on the people taking advantage of their opportunity and by helping to pay the expense ot the campaign, keep the rich men from doingso, and give the demagogues no chanceto inafime the masses against the rich.It will increase their love for country and be a test of enilghtenea gandpatriotic manhood. If 'they fail to doso the nexCcampaign.may ;see the oldorder of things resumed. "Let us,"as Mr. Camden says, "on our part uphold Woodrow Wilson and see that Jheis not left to the humiliation" of askinghis personal friend3 to pay him out ofdebt."iA Good Move.Every Federal pensioner residingin Bourbon county, as well as othernortions of the country, will be glad tolearn that the government has decidedto' mail checks direct from Washingtonand eliminate the voucher system ofpayment. This will save the "boys"the trouble of . acknowledging theirsignatures before a notary or" publicofficer. They will also get their checksI earlier andnot have to wait for thereturn of the voucher. ft, .-fctNervous TroublesKill AmbitionTona Vita Brings it Back toWorn-Out, Half SickPeople.One of the principal sympthoms ofnervous troubles is a feeling of discouragement. A man or woman 'suffering withnerve exhaustion feels so worn outand miserable most of the time thatthey become hopeless and depressed.Life doesn't seem to be worth living. Tona Vita has been pronounced byphysicians to be the most reliable andsuccessful tonic and nerve foodever sold to the nublic. It is buildingup many thousands of run down, nervous men and women and restoringthem to health and happiness.If you are a sufferer "from nervousbreakdown try this great tonic, anda" you feel your health, strength andambition return, you will be changedin mind as well as body. Life willseem like a different thing to you in afew weeks' tiine.Tona Vita is sold by Chas. E. Butler& Co.Cause of High Cost.The Republicans and the Bull Moosers try to make the people believe thatthere is no connection between the excessive tariff and the high cost ot living. Moody's Magazine, an authorityon economics, prints a table to showthat in ten years prices only increasd 7.7 per cent in Europe, while inAmerica the average was 54.3 per centwith the nrices on some articles increased over 100 Der cent. The tariffand the trusts are chiefly responsiblefor the high cost of living. Vote forWilson, Marshall and the Democraticnominees for Congress with assuranceof a reduction of the one and the subjection of the others to the laws of theland, instead of being a law unto themselves.

When thoughts begin to growcloudy and uncertain, impulses lag and t'az warnings of pain and distress are sentlike flying messages throughout limbs and frame, straightway, nine times in ten, awoman will by the cause of the troub!e to some defect at the point where she firstfelt it. Is it a headache, a backache, a sensation of irritability or twitching anduncontrollable nervousness, something mu3t be wrong with the heed or back, awoman naturally says, but all the time the real trouble very often centers in thswomanly organs. In nine cases out of ten the seat of the dificulty is here, and awoman should take rational treatment Xnr its care. The local disorder and inflammation of the delicate special organs cf the se;i should be treated steadily andsystematically. tDr. Pierce, during a long period of practice, found that c prescription madefrom medicinal extracts o native roots, without the use cf alcohol, relieved over 90per cent, of such cases.

G.White oroperty in While Adrtition,which was purchased by the hospitalcommissioners for that purpose, is being pushed with all haste, and whilethere is yet a large amount of work tobe done before the buiHing will bethrown open, there 'is every evidenceof the keenest activity on the parti ofthe contractors and those who have theimprovements under their supervision.Notwithstanding the fact that therehas already been a vast expenditurefor the hospital.building and the improvements so far, which has aboutconsumed all of the sumlus devisedlor the purpose, there will no doubt beample funds for the completion of thework that has been undertaken, although it may be necessary to solicitprivat and popular subscrintionsjo finish the building and lit it out properly.The scarcity ortunds wui maKe itnecessary to abandon the plan for acolored ward at'present, but it is probable that a sum sufficient to constructan addition and tfi out apartments forthe colored peoplejwill be raised. Thecolored lodges of this.city have a sumof $1,000 tor this purpose and a prominent business man oi this section hasmade the proposition to furnish tenper cent ot.the total cost for a coloredward. It is said the entire cost willbe about S5.500. a little more than onethird-of which has been raised.latter being divided into medical andsurgical wards. Five private roomswill be located on the second floor, andeach of the three floors will have amodernly equipped diet kitchen. Astairway from the tront and rear ofthe building etxends to the secondfloor, and the entire building is fittedwith an electric ca'l system. All ofthe electric wiring in the building hasbeen completed and approved by theunderwriters.tThe original arrangements of thehuildinc will Drovide many conveniences, wasnstanas ana cioseis, whichwere installed when the building waserected many yearsjagow ill be left inposition and thelarchitectural drawingsfurnish an abundance of closets andDresses throughout the house.Realiizng the importance ot utilizingevery available inch of space, the thirdfloor will be finished to the extent ofseveral rooms and m,which will be located an operating and sterilizing! room, dressing room together with alounging room tor the physicians andsurgeons who will devote their timeand labors tojthe ward patients.In the operating room will be installedan outfit, an order for which has beenplaced with Mr, Edward Hutchcraft,representing the Scanlon Morris Co.,of'Chicago, which has been purchasedby,the physicians of this city ata costof $1,800. The expense of this "equipment is borne entirely by the localphysicians, and the funds for this purpose was made up between them.As a compliment to those interestedin the hospital movement and in the- at - s- - liir 40v?1t 1- fc TJn 4-sil-i sin -Fl-m A visit to the buildirigyesterday morn j hag donated t0 the hosDitafone of themg for the purpose of getting an idea . handsomest oneratin tables to be nur-chased, and the same pattern used bythe Mayo Bros., of Kochester, Minn.,and which will be installed in the emergency operating foom.On the third floor will be located thechildren's ward, facing on the westand overlooking the broad poitico.The ward has a capacity of six bedsnumber of cribs.

Of the endowmentfund of $10,000 left by MrH. Masaiethe larger portion has been expendedin the improvement of the White property for the hospital.There yet remains many improvements on the building for which nocontract has been let. The hardwoodfloors, painting of the walls of thenuilding and furnishing thej rooms willnqiire a considerable sum and it islikely a campaign will be started soonto raise a sufficient amount to defraysuch expenses.Tne HosDital Circle has a sum ofabout $4,000 and is considering whichwnrk to undertake. However, it is authoritatively stated that it may makean effort to raise sufficient funds tomeetjthe entire expense. PAt any rate,in the event of their failure to d6 sothe local fraternal organizations andprivate individuals will be asked tofurnish some of the rooms in the building.An endowment tund for the childrens' ward, it is said will be provided bv one of our nublic spiritedwomen, who will contribute a ium of$500 for the purpose of maintaining thisdepartment.One ob3ectionable;teature to tne surroundings of the hosmtal is that thegiounds are inadequatejand it has beensuggested that an effort be made topurchase sucffiient of the adjoiningpronerty to furnish beautiful grounds.The" landscaping ot the present groundswill be in the hands of a competentman, who has generously tendered hisI services without cost.With the proper encouragement tothe movement and the united effort ofthe citizens of Paris toward the present needs of the institution, the hospital should be completd and turnedover to the trustees without any indebtedness hanging over it, beginningits career under the most favorableauspices and remain the pride of thecommurytv which has so long soughtan institution of this character.MATRIMONIAL.room, theorder for which has been placed witha leading firm, and it will be installedon the third floor.The operating rooms are all arrang-nish the most natural light.
