of fakirs who "exhibited" him- at
Lexington aud Louisville, still Mle
.and hearty, was this year allowed o
rest in, peace in his Greasy CreVk
.home, no doubt to accumulate an
other small mortgage on it, so he can
be "exhibited," say two years rfrpm
now, by which time it Is expecte'diie
will have reached the ripe old age
of one hundred and seventy-five, jraars
Uncle Johnnie was a gold mine for
that bunch of Lexington grafters,
