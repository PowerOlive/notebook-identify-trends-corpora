While in the little Northern Cal

scenes for "Boys Will Be Boys'
Will Rogers' latest picture, showing
at the Alamo and the Grand to-day,
the star returned" the many courte
sies of the citizens by" giving a com
plimentary showing of one of his
previous pictures. He also told the
audience that any suggestions for
the betterment of the picture would
be appreciated.
Truth has always been one of the
biggest factors in history. Because
of it, nations have been made and
empires have fallen. A motion
picture, dealing with Truth on a
massive scale, is Paramount's pro
duction of "The Greatest Truth,"
which comes to the Alamo and
Grand to-day. It is a continental
production of the finest grade and
Mia May is the feature player.
Rarely does a motion picture
come t)o this city more favorably
heralded tby reviewers, than doeB
the Fox photoplay, "A Self-Made
Man," which will open at the Al

screen story has been playing to
large audiences wherever it has
been shown, and should meet with
a hearty welcome here. From all
