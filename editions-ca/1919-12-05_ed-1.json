There's A Five-Fold Advantage
In Its Appetizing Milk Goodness
IN Crusader Milk Bread there's a five
fold goodness that makes a direct appeal
to hungry appetites -at .every meal and
between meals.
That goodness is due to the rich milk
content. It is milk, that makes the texture
of Crusader Bread so even, smooth and
porous.
It is milk which makes the crumb lighter
and which gives it that delicious creamy
flavor.
It is milk that makes Crusader Milk Bread
so extremely palatable that keeps plates
and hands coming back for more.
It is milk that adds4 to the enjoyment of
every bite.
And it is milk that makes this bread truly
nourishing. Children thrive on it.
Order a large or small loaf from your
"" grocer to-day and learn how good it is,
from its crisp, tender brown crust to the
last morsel. A real surprise awaits you.
