BOURBON FARMING CONDITIONS.
Weather conditions were generally
favorable last week for the maturing
of crops, rain and "sunshine alter
nating in seasonable proportions.
September, as a result, came in with
pastures, foliage, crops and gardens
all looking fine.
The closing week of August was
unusually cool, making wraps and ex
tra covers comfortable. Hemp cutting
is still in progress, arid some tobacco
was cut and housed last week.
Some of the hemp is short in some
sections of the county, but most of
it is very fine. Help is scarce and
hard to get. Farmers are paying
from $2.00 to $2.75 per day to men
working in tobacco.
Prices for garden stuff continue
high. Roasting ears are bringing
thirty, cents per dozen, homegrown
canteloupes twenty cents each, and
other products in proportion. Home
grown sweep potatoes are not yet in
the market, and the Southern impor
tations are retiling at $1.00 per
Eggs are again thirty-five
cents per dozen, butter forty cents
per pound, and spring chickens .$7.00
per dozen.

NORMA' TALMADGE IN "POPPY"
AT ALAMO AND GRAND.
Norma Talmadge, the popular Selz-nick-Pictures
star, will be seen on the
screen of the Alamo Theatre and the
Paris Grand Wednesday afternoon
and nierht in her latest feature pho I
todrama, "Poppy." This is adapted
from the play by Ben Teal and John
P. Ritter, which was taken from
Cynthia Stockley's novel. The story
is intensely dramatic throughout,
dealing with the life of a young girl
who graduates from drudgery to re
finement. Miss Talmadge plays the part of
Poppy Destin, whose life is moulded
by three men, Luce Abinger, the un
scrupulous, Dr. Bramhan, the gener
ous, and Evelyn Carson, the lover.
These persons have become known as
"the three worst men. in South Af
rica" on account of their adventures
with women, but two of them prove
that they are entitled to less sinister
description. Through them the unique
situation arises of a - young woman
married to a man without knowing
it, while the man she loves and who
loves her believes his one meeting
with her was only a dream. The un
raveling "of the original plot is one
of the most fascinating of the screen
stories of the year.

SEPTEMBER'IS HERE.
September, you appeal to all,
Both young and old, lordly
and
lowly,
You stuff the hay-mow, trough and
stall, .
Till horse and cow's as roly-poly
As pigs is, slopped on buttermilk
And brand, shipstuff and 'tater
peelin's And folks, too, feelin fine as silk
With all their feelin's!
Riley.
September, our first autumn month,
is here, and will be a very eventful
one, with the opening of the city and
county schools, and the return of
students to their school duties. It
will mean a sundering of home ties
in many a home, as it will also mark
the departure of drafted men for
army service, "somewhere."
On account of war conditions the
summer has passed very quietly soci
ally, and there was very little enter
taining, as nearly every moment was
devoted to Red Cross work.
The only social events of much im
portance were the annual dances in
Paris and Millersburg. The dance at
the Masonic Temple last night was in
the nature of a farewell to students
leaving for the various schools and
colleges.
