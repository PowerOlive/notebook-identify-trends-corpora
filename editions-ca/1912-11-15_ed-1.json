BIG VOTE OFFER
ing about to the effect that this and
thattcandidate have powerful organiza
tions behind them and that thy are go
ing to win "hands down" : that they
have the thing "cinched", and a lot of
that kind of rot. And some of the
friends of the candidates get this idea
into their heads and enlarge upon it
and as the result, their imaginary
vote is about "steen millions" a day.
Don't be easy There are a lot of
bluffers in this world who like to get
into contests and scare the other can
didates out. Just stick tto the finish
and see it through and you will see
that you are badly worried about noth
ing, ine trouble witn the majority
of the candidates is that they get scar
ed out tod easily. Thev Bee some oth
er candidate right at the top of the
list and think that they have no chance
but they do not atop to consider that
one or two subscriptions will bring
them right to the top of the list. Some
of the candidates who are near the top
are not the strongest candidates by
any means. In this contest, m fact,
someof those who are up in the list
have not done any active fwork them
selves, it has simply happened that
one or two of their friends who are
subscribers have naid their subscrip
tions and given the votes to these can
didates. This is especially true in the
second district.
In DistrictJNo. 2, there is such an
unusually good opportunity for candi
dates to win a prize very easily.
There is bound to be at least four
prizes awarded to this district and
possibly five and there are very few
active workers po that.if a candidate
should start now, she" could cinch a
prize with a week's work. Just a
little pleasant work among the friends
you meet every day will enable you to
pick up one of these valuable prizes
with a very Iht'e effort. Stop "thin -ing
the matter over" and get busy at
once.

Senator Thomas Mentioned.
That the eyes of the political writ
ers of the Slate as well as the leading
politicians are upon State Senator
Llaude M, Thomas, and that it isfprob
able that he will have tendered him a
nice position under the National Dem
ocratic administratipn is shown by the
following taken f com the political col
umn of the Louisville Times :
"As Kentucky seems to have a
'cinch' on the place of United States
Minister to Peru, the question is who
will succeed Judge H. Clay Howard,
of Paris, the present Minister to the
South American Republic. Senator
Claude M. Thomas, of Paris, is being
frequently mentioned for the place in
the diplomatic service, and if he wants
it could probably land, as he was one
of the first Woodrow Wilson men in
Kentucky. Besides Senator Thomas is
well equipped for diplomatic service,
having held the oost of American Con
sulJGeneral at Marseilles, France, dur
ing Cleveland's administation."
