The religious equilibrium of our lit
ttle city was somewhat shaky last
week when it became generally known
that one S. J. Arnold, a Russehte,
was to deliver a lecture at the opera
house Thursday evening. But little is
known of this form of religion here
and there were a multitude of rumors
afloat as to its character and teach
ing. Several discussed the advisabil
ity of attending and some went so far
asvto advise with their pastors. The
-day arrived and with it Mr. Arnold.
"THe weather was disagreeable and ne
-was greeted with a small crowd, there
being about thirty present. As the
audience was small it was hard for
. ihim to get the amount of enthusiasm
necessary to create proper interest.
His scriptural texts were taken from
the first three chapters of Genesis and
the last three chapters of the New J
Testament. Mr. Arnold has been sent 1 :
by the board of missions of his church
to make the Central Kentucky towns

Burglars Enter Saloon.
Burglars entered the saloon of James
Connelly on Main street sometime Sun
day afternoon or night, and after mak
ing an attempt to break open the safe,
which contained a large sum of money,
left without accomplishing their pur
pose. An entrance was gained to the build
ing through one of the rear doors, the
panel of which was broken out and the
door unlocked from the inside. The
safe which occuuicd a place beneath
the dear counter was moved and turn
ed with front up on the floor, evidently
the work of two men. The cracksmen
empiuyed a chisel and monkey-wrench
in cutting the hinges, breaking off the
dial and handle.
" The combination was broken and the
chisel driven throuorh the door. This
I instrument was left as it had been
I driven, the burglars evidently being
! unable to extricate it. The front of
the safe was badly battered and gave
evidence of being "struck a number of
1 times with a heavy hammer. Through

Whaley Sale.
One of the largest crowds ever in
attendance on a like occasion assem
bled in Paris at the stock pens of Cay
wood & McClintock Friday, to at
tend the public sale of live stock offer
ed by Mr. Win. H. Whaley, ,Jr., of
Bourbon.
Buyers of Fayette, Clark, Nicholas,
Montgomery, Scott, Boyle and other
nearby counties were present, and the
bidding was spirited from the begin
ning. (Auctioneers George D. SpeaKes,
of Paris. Al. Loomis, ot Winchester,
and Charles Vanhook, of Cynthiana,
were in charge of the sale, and they
kept things humming from the begin
ning. The sale was one of the largest stock
sales held here in years and several
hundred head of horsee, ponies, mules,
cattle, sheep, etc., changed hands at
good prices. It was too early to
estimate the total amount the sale
yielded, but it runs up into the thous
ands of dollars.
The Barton Rogers farm, which Mr.
Whaley recently purchased, was sold
shortly after dinner, and after spirited
bidding the place was knocked down to
Mr. Charles C Clarku, of near North
Middlptown, who secured the place at

Councilman Walker says we convey
ed a wrong impression in stating in
our last issue that he opposed a fran
chise for natural gas at the last meet
ing of the City Council. He says what
he opposed was recognizing the fran
chise notice as an ordinance. , He says
we also prred in stating that that was
the only thing of importance that!
transpired at the meeting, as he had
opposed the paying of the city work
hands every Saturday as it was con
trary to law to so pay them.
We may ha"e been wrong in think
ing that Mr. Walker was opposed to
the franchise, but we based our conclu
sion not only on the fact that he op
posed the ordinance as published, on
the grounds of a technical legal error,
but also from the fact that when the
ordinance was read and offered in the
way in which he had suggested would
be legal and when the yea and nay
vote was called on the ordinance to
advertise the sale of a natural gas
franchise when Mr. Walker voted nay,
all others, except perhaps one, voting
yea and carrying the ordinance.
The ordinance, however, was recon
sidered and rejected unanimously be
cause Col. Stewart, representing the
natura gas people statedytfe would not
bid on ' the ordinance in the form in
;
which it was offered as the company
objected to some or the terms laid
down for a guarantee that they would
carry out theircmtract and actually
furnish natural gas within a specified
time. He stated however, he thought
that if the matter were deferred to
another meeting he thought satisfac
tory terms could be argeed-upon.
As to the other important point
which Mr. Walker says was omitted
we did not intend to slight the matter.
Mr. Walker did oppose the weekly
payment of the day laborers as he con
sidered it illegal to do so and asked
that they should wait for;their money
until it could be allowed at rthe regu
lar Council meetings every two weeks,
but as the explanation was made that
there had been standing on the city'
records for a number of years a reso
lution that the day laborers be paid
their wages each week we did not con
sider that this was a very important
matter, as the Council voted not to
change the custom.

THEATRICAL.
"THE THREE TWINS."
"The Three Twins." which comes to
the Paris Grand on Mondav, March 10,
is positively one of thebest musical
comedies that has everbeen produced.
Its long run in Chicago of five months
at the Whitney Opera House, and of
eight months at the Herald Square
Theatre, in Npw Xork, where the S.
R. O. sign was displayed nightly,
vouches for thp worth of the attrac
tion. "The Three Twins" is a musical
comedy with a plot and many novel
features, the conglomeratp nonFense,
the riot of. color, and the spirited
movements make such an agreeable
attack on one's senses that it matters
not under what name the revelry goes.
The music tantillates and tantalizes,
and the witty lines and adept clownin
excites one to laughter.

Baseball Meeting Friday.
The future of the Paris. Base Ball
Club will be determined at a . meeting
called by President .1. W. Bacon to be
held at the court house Friday after
noon at 2:30 o'clock. All interested in
base ball are requested to .attend as
most important subjects wil be dis
cussed. At present there is a dire, need of
funds with which to start the season,
and according to President Bacon they
must be forthcoming if Paris would
get in the running. The course is
taken for the purpose of giving the,
players who pre row under contract te
get positions if it is decided, not to
have a team, and to make a''disposf
tion of the franchise.
In event the fans display the proper
enthusiasm and an effort is made to.
Dut the team on) it feet. Presient
Bacon will ask tpat his successor Jbe.
nampd to head ine club this season.
Business interests with which he is
identified, requies all his time, and lie
cannot devote himself to the club this
season.
,, THe meeting Friday afternoon should
be largely attended and local jfans
should display the proper interest,,, to :
start the team off right. Let every
body who can do so attend. Thjs, is
the final appeal and some yunderstgnd
in? must be reached before the close
of the meeting. If you want base ball
attend the meeting and make vnnr
wants known.
