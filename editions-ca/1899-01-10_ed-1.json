TOUR LOCAL PAPER
HAVE YOU ANY IDEA OF WHAT IT HAS
0OHE FOR YOU
And m to What Yon Might Do In
Return Have Yon Ever Given That
a Passing Thoaghtf An Editors
Interesting Review of the Subject
The paper has done 50 things for you
and is only anxious to do 50 more
II told your friends when your par
enta were married
It announced to the world when yon
were bora
It it corded the great events of your
childhood when you were lost as a
wandering baby when you had the
measles and scarlet fever when you fell
into the washtub and nearly drowned
when you fell from the cherry tree and
broke your collar bone when you first
started to school and when you earned
your first prize
Later on it told how you had com
pleted the studies of the district school
and how eloquently you reoited your
gpadnating oration
It told of your entering high school or
academy It told of your contests in
baseball and tennis It told of your de
parture for college or your first venture
in business
It told of your various visits back to
the old hone neighborhood and it al
ways wished you well in yonr greatest
undertakings
It hinted modestly about the first
time you went a courting and gave
timely warning to hei folks that the
neighbors knew that matters were grow
ing interesting over their way
It announced the time of your expect
ed wedding and it published the notice
of the marriage license and gave you a
nice puff concerning the wedding cere
mony
It told of your extended honeymoon
tour and of your settling down to house
keeping
When you were sick the home paper
week by week informed your more dis
tant neighbors of yonr lapses and im
provements
It told about your lost cow and led
to her recovery It told how yonr horse
had been stolen and led to the arrest of
the thief
When you were getting dull and tired
through the monotony of your labor
the paper urged that the people get up
a celebration and you were named as
one of a suitable committee on arrange
ments And when it was all over it
gave you just praise for the success of
the undertaking
In numerous ways the paper has
helped to put your name before the peo
ple And you would never have had
your lucrative office or your honorable
recognition from the community but for
the kind aid of the local printer
If you are a member of a Sunday
school or society of any sort that same
paper publishes your announcements
and the various proceedings of your
meetings
It tells the people much which you
would like to have known but which
modesty or necessity prevents you from
telling
If you and all your folks have been
prosperous and fortunate in your affairs
the paper has boosted you all the way
If you have had misfortune the paper
asked for sympathy in your behalf
Thus the paper has rejoiced when you
rejoiced and wept when you wept If
you are a good and enterprising citizen
the paper will always be your friend
and will back you in your enterprises
and will help to find your business
friends
It tells you where to buy and where
to sell It tells of rogues to be avoided
It tells you of current prices and pre
vents you from being cheated and swin
dled in 100 ways
Finally when you die the paper will
publish your obituary and will cover
over your faults and will recite the
story of your good deeds
AH these thingsthe local editor will
cause his paper to do but no one else
in the world will do them or can do
them for you even for love or money
The outside paper is a stranger to your
little world and is not at all interested
in its improvement Yet your local pa
per does all this free of cost to yon if
you are wilting to receive it that way
However for your eake vro hope you
are too generous to accept so many un
requited favors and that you are willing
to reciprocate the same
Help the editor Be his friend and he
will prove his friendship to you
Subscribe for his paper and pay for
it regularly in advance and get your
neighbors to do the same
Send him the news or occasionally a
watermelon or a peck of peaches
Invite him to your picnics and fam
ily dinners so that he can eat a square
meal occasionally
Dont cail the ticket you give him to
the church concert a deadhead He
cant buy tickets from everybody to
everything but he will say kind words
of your performances and thus lead oth
ers to buy your tickets
If you have anything to buy or sell
let the paper assist you to find custom
ers Advertising that really Days the
printer Denents DOta aaveriisers auu
readers
If you have any job printing to do
dont take it to an outside office but
give your newspaper the first chance
Give the editor a pointer occasionally
or write him sensible short articles and
dont get mad if he fails to see every
thing your way When he does say a
good thing tell him so
In short remember the golden rule
and dont forget the editor of your local
paper Richmond Ind Enterprise
A Severe Thump
He I was reading somewhere the
other day that no woman should ever
marry a geniua
She Oh well dont let that worry
you Even if the girls were disposed to
heed such advice the bars would still be
down for you Chicago News
