say they will keep it there untilthe belated troops arrive if it takestill winterThus far the marines have had thebest of the fighting but the situationis grave and they are exhausted withrepelling almost incessant attacksThay have little chance to rest orsleep and the time of the arrival ofthe relieving troops is uncertainWere it not for the protecting gunsof the fleet the gallant little bandwould be annihilated by the Spanishtroops in overpowering numbers fromSantiago de Cuba As it is they probably can hold their position but theycan not move forward until reinforcedby troopsIt is impossible to accurately estimate the Spanish attacking force butit is numerous enough About twothirds of this force surrounds the campnightly with a deadly ring and thespatting of the Mausers makes thingsquite lively for the Spaniards are daring enough to crawl up and take a popshot at the marines from the bushesabout thirty yards from the camp Atnight the besiegers fight like Indiansand our old Apache fighters will feelin their element Ever3r yard of chapparal is an ambuscade and picket dutyis flipping coins with deathAfter the first attack on Saturdaynrght Col Huntington decided thatanother attempt would be made onSunday night and he caused entienchments to be thrown up on all sides ofthe camp and in the trenches the mainpart of the battalion waited for the attack that the colonel was certain wouldcome It arrived within a short timeafter dark and from that time untildaybreak the firing was incessant andat times very heavyOn the American side two men werekilled and four injured The

night the Spaniard attacked the camp of the marines on theshore and the Marblehead believingthe Americans had been driven outthrew several shells into the placeThe attack however was repulsed bythe small detachment o marines incamp without trouble The shells ofthe Marblehead struck among the marinesThe fight was the first of the war inwhich the Cubans co operated withthe American forces and their cooperation was not a glittering successAt one time during the afternoonwhenever the marines were firing ona small detachment of Spaniards thatmade their appearance a short distance from the camp the Cubans began firing without orders and sent avolley right among the AmericansThere were several very narrow escapes but no one was injuredLieut Neville of Company D wassent out on scout duty and as on theday previous he attacked a smallstone fort A hot fight followed andthe Spaniards were driven off withloss It was during this fight thatWallace and Tauman fell over thecliffFifteen dead Spaniards includingone lieutenant were found in the fortThe night attack was picturesqueand a striking spectacle the crack ofthe Mausers tongues of fire fromevery bush encircling the camp thetwitter of the long steel bullets overhead while the machine guns downon the water were ripping open thepickets and the crash of thefield guns could be heard as theywere driving in cannister where thefire of the Spaniards was the thickestThen there was the screech of the Marbleheads shells as she took a hand inthe fight and the sharp quick flashingof the Colts rapid firing 1 pounder gunsfrom the

Two Cubans werekilled and four woundedIt is impossible to estimate the number of Spaniards engaged owing totheir guerilla methods of fighting butit is believed that there were at leastfour hundredThe marines behaved splendidlytheir marksmanship being excellentThe captured camp lies about fivemiles southeast of the rifle pits of themarines and was an important base forthe enemy as it contained the onlywell within six or seven miles LieutCol Huntington decided on the attackearly in the day and at about S oclockthe force started across the mountainThe march up and down the steep hillsides under the glaring tropical sunwas a severe test of endurance for themarines and before the battle groundwas reached 22 men had received medical attention All were able howeverto reach the posi tion before the fighting ceasedThe marines were compelled tomarch in single file following themountain trail Meanwhile the Cubans darted backward and forward toright and left on the scout It wasnoon when from a hilltop the Americans caught sight of the Spanish camplying on a ridge below them It consisted of one large house the officersquarters surrounded by numerousshacks and houses all clusteringabout the precious wellThe Americans began a cautious advance and were within 200 3 ards of theenemy before the crack of a rifle fromthe Spanish lines announced that theSpaniards had discovered themThe troops quickly moved into lineof battle tith the Cubans on the leftflank The enemys bullets were whirling viciously over the Americans butthe marines settled down to theirwork as unconcernedly as though attarget practiceVery few Spaniards were in sightThey were lying bhind the huts andthe brushbut thjafrpuffs of smoke revealed their positions and enabled theAmericans to do effective work For20 minutes bofhsides maintained a eryrific fire The Spanish shots wereerally wild and spasmodic while theAmericans coolly fired away aimingcarefully and shooting to kill Forthe most part the Americans firingwas done individually but at times theofficers would direct firing by squadsalways with telling effectIt was beginning to look as thougha bayonet charge down the slopewould be necessary to dislodge theenemy when suddenly the latter began to break for a thicket a hundredyards further on Little groups couldbe seen fleeing from the camp separating darting through the brush andzig zagging to escape the bulletsIt was then the American fire became most deadly Man after mancould be seen to fall in a vain rush forshelter and the fire from the Spanishbecame scattering and almost ceasedTwo Cubans lay dead and fourwounded and Private Walker of Company D had to limp to the rear with aslight wound in his ankleThe easy victory put the commandin high spirits The little black Cubanwarriors waved their machetes andhowled curses at the Spanish in savagefashion Their firing had been wildthroughout but they displayed the utmost contempt for the Spanish bullets apparently being absolutely without fearAs the enemy began breaking fromcamp the Dolphin which lay out atsea was signaled and began pitchingshells toward the thicket for which theSpaniards were making MeanwhileLieut Magill was seen coming with 40men as reinforcements and CaptMahony was on the way with 100 morebut before either could reach the scenethe trouble was overAs the Spanish retreated the Americans moved slowly

out ofthe woods They had got their rationsfor that day as the captain put it andwe had the place to ourselves and aquiet time to overhaul the wounded andget dinner Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger and evenoutside we -could hardly tell what wewere at for the horror of the loudSToans that reached us from the doctors patientsOut of the eight men who hail fallenm the action only three still breathedone of the pirates who had1 beenshot at the loop hole Hunter andCapt Smollett and of these the firsttwo were as good as dead the mutineerindeed died under the doctors knifeand Hunter do what we could never recovered consciousness in this world Helingered all day breathing loudly likethe old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit but the bones of his chesthad been crushed by the blow and hisskull fractured in falling and sometime in the following night withoutsign or sound he went to his MakerAs for the captain his wounds weregrievous indeed but not dangerousISo organ was fatally injured Andersons bail for it was Job that shot himfirst had broken his shoulder bladeand touched the lung not badly thesecond had only torn and displacedsome muscles ip the calf He was suretpTecover the doctor said but in themeantime and for -Greeks to come heTOjist notlwallcor move his armnor soirmen as speak when he could help itMy own accident cut across theknuckles was a fleabite Dr Liveseypatched it up with plaster and pulledmy ears for me into the bargainAfter dinner the squire and the doctor sat by the captains side awhile inconsultation and when they had talkedto their hearts content it being then alittle past noon the doctor took up hishat and pistols girt on n cutlass putthe chart in his pocket and with amusket over his shoulder crossed thepalisade on the north side and set offbriskly through the treesGray and I were sitting together atthe far end of the block house to beout of earshot of our officers consulting and Gray took his pipe out of hismouth and fairty forgot to put it backagain so thunder struck he was at thisoccurrenceWhy in the nameiOf Davy Jonessaid he is Dr Livesey madWhy no says I Hes about thelast of this crew for that I take itWell shipmate said1 Gray madhe maj not be but if hes not -mark mywords I amI take it replied I the doctor hashis idea and if I am right fhes goingnow to see Ben GunnI was right as appeared later but inthe meantinme the house being stiflinghot and the little patch of sand insidethe palisade ablaze with midday sunI began to get another thought into myhead which was not by any means soright What I began io do was to envythe doctor walking in the cool shadowof the woods with 1he birds about himand the pleasant smell of the pineswhile I sat grilling with my clothesstuck to the hot resin and so muchblood about me and so many poor deadbodies lying all around that I took adisgust of the place that was almost asstrong as fearAll the time I was washing out theblock house and then washing up thethings from dinner this disgust andenvy kept growing stronger andstronger tall at last being near a breadbag and no one then observing me Itook the first step towardony escapadeand filledboth pockets of nry coat withbiscuitsI was a fool if you like and certainlyI was going to do a foolish overboldact but I was determined to do it withail the precautions in my power Thesebiscuits should anything befall mewould keep me at least from starvingtill far on in the next dayThe next thing I laid hold of was abrace of pistols and as I already had apowder horn and bullets L felt myself well supplied with armsAs for the scheme I had in my head itwas not a bad one in itself It was togo down the spit that divides theanchorage on the east from the open seafind the white rock I had observed lastevening and ascertain whether it wasthere or not that Ben Gunn had hiddenhis boat a thingquite worth doing asI still believe But as I was certain Ishould rot be allowed to leave the inclosvre my only plan was to takeHg-v TjVvaFrench leave and slip out when nobody was watching and that was sobad a way of doing it as made the thingitself wrong But I was only a boy andI had made my mind upWell as things at last fell out I foundan admirable opportunity The squireand Gray were busy helping the captainwith his bandages the coast was clearI made a bolt for it over the stockadeand into the thickest of the trees andbefore any absence was observed I wasout of cry of companionsThis was my second folly far worsethan the first as I left but two soundmen to guard the house but like thefirst it was a help toward saving all ofusI took my way straight for the eastcoast of the island for I was determinedto go down the sea side of the spit toavoid all chance of observation fromthe anchorage It was already late inthe afternoon although still warm andsunny As I continued to thread thetall woods I could hear from far beforeme not only the continuous thunderof the surf but a certain tossing offoliage and grinding of boughs whichshowed me the sea breeze had set inhigher than usual Soon cool draughtsof air hegtin to reach me and a fewsteps further I came forth into the openborders of the grove and saw the sealying blue and sunny to the horizonand the surf tumbling and tossing itsfoam along the beachI have never seen the sea quiet roundTreasure island The sun might blazeoverhead the air be without a breaththe surface smooth and blue but stillthese great rollers would be runningalong all the external coast thundering and thundering by day and nightand I scarce believe there is one spot inthe island where a man would be out ofearshot of their noiseI walked along beside the surf withgreat enjoyment till thinking I wasnow got far enough to the south Itook the cover of some thick bushesand crept warily up to the ridge of thespitBehind me was the sea in front theanchorage The sea breeze as thoughit had the sooner blown itself out byits unusual violence was at anend it had been succeeded by lightvariable airs from the south and southeast carrying great banks of fog andthe anchorage under lee of Skeletonisland lay still and leaden as whenfirst we entered it The Hispaniolain that unbroken mirror was exactlyportrayed from the truck to the waterline the Jolly Roger hanging from herpeakAlongside lay one of the gigs Silverin the stern sheets him I could alwaysrecognize while a couple of men wereleaning over the stern bulwarks one ofthem with a red cap the very rogueI had seen some hours before stridelegs upon the palisade Apparentlythey were talking and laughing thoughat that distance upward of a mile Icould of course hear no word of whatwas said All at once there began themost horrid unearthly screamingw1 nacr soon rememDereavtne voice 01Capt Flint and even thought I couldmake out the bird by her bright plumage as she sat perched upon her masters wristSoon after the jolly boat shoved offand pulled for shore and the man withthe red cap and his comrade went belowby the cabin companionJust about the same time the sunhad gone down behind the Spy glassand as the fog was collecting rapidlyit began to grow dark in earnest Isaw I must lose no time if I were to findthe boat- that eveningThe white rock visible enough abovethe brush was still some eighth of amile further down the spit and it tookme a goodish while to get up with itcrawling often on all fours among thescrub Night had almost come whenI laid my hand on its rough sidesEight below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf hiddenby banks and a thick underwood aboutknee deep that grew there very plentifully and in the center of the dellsure enough a little tent of goatskinslike what the gypsies carry about withthem in EnglandI dropped into the hollow lifted theside of the tent and there was BenGunns boat homemade if ever anything was homemade a rude lop sidedframework of tough wood andstretched upon that a covering of goalskin with the hair inside The thingwas extremely small even for me andI can hardly imagine that it could havefloated with a full sized man Therewas one thwart set as low as possible akind of stretcher in the bows and adouble paddle for propulsionI had not then seen a coracle suchas the ancient- Britons made butl Ihave seen once since and I can give youno fairer idea cf Ben Gunns boat thanby saying it was like the first and theworst coracle ever made by man Butthe great advantage if the coracle it certainly possessed for it was exceedinglylight and portableWell now that I had found the boatyou would have thought 1 had hadenough of truantry for once but in themeantime I had taken another notionand become so obstinately fond of itthat I would have carried it out I believe in the teethof Capt Smollett himself This was to slip out under coverof the night cut the Hispaniolaadrift and let her go ashore where shefancied I had quite made up my mindthat the mutineers after their repulseof the morning had nothing nearertheir hearts than to up anchor and awayto sea this I thought it would be afine thing to prevent and now tbat Ihad seen how they left their watchmenunprovided with a boat 1 thought itmight be done with little riskDown I sat to wait for darkness andmade a hearty meal of biscuit It wasa night out of ten thousand for my purpose The fog had now buried allheaven As the last rays of daylightdwindled and disappeared absoluteblackness settled down on Treasureisland- And when at last 1 shoulderedIgrswFTTthe coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where Ihadsupped there were but two points visible on the whole anchorageOne was the great fire on shore bywhich the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp The other a mereblur of light upon the darkness indicated the position of the anchoredship She had swung round to the ebbher bow was now toward me theonly lights on board Avere in the cabinand what I saw was merely a reflectionon the fog of the strong rays that flowedfrom the stern windowThe ebb had already run some timeand I had to wade through the long beltof swampy sand where I sunk severaltimes above the ankle before I came tothe edge of the retreating water andwading a little way in with somestrength and dexterity set my coraclekeel downward on the surfaceCHAPTER XXinTHE EBB TIDE RUNSThe coracle as I had ample reason toknow before I was done with her wasa very safe boat for a person of myheight and weight both buoyant andclever in a seaway but she was themost cross grained lop sided craft tomanage Do as you pleased she alwaysmade more leeway than anything elseand turning round and round was themaneuver she was best at Even BenGunn himself has admitted that she wasqueer to handle till you knew herwayCertainly I did not know her wayShe turned in every direction but onethe one I was bound to go the mostpart of the time we were broadside onand I am very sure I never should havemade the ship at all but for the tideBy good fortune paddle as I pleasedthe tide was still sweeping me downand there lay the Hispaniola right inthe fair way hardly to be missedFirst she loomed before me like ablot of something yet blacker thandarkness then her spars and hull began to take shape and the next moment as it seemed for the further Iwent the brisker grew the current ofthe ebb I was alongside her hawserand had laid holdThe hawser was as taut as a bowstring so strong she pulled upon heranchor All round the hull in theblackness the rippling current hubbled and chattered like a little mountain stream One cut with my seagully and the Hispaniola would gohumming down the tideSo far so good but it next occurredto my recollection that a taut hawserEach with a hand en the others throatsuddenly cut is a thing as dangerousas a kicking horse Ten to one if Iwere so foolhardy as to cut the Hispaniola from her anchor I and thecoracle would be knocked clean out ofthe waterThis brought me to a full stop andif fortune had not again particularlyfavored me I should have had to abandon my design But the light airswhich had begun blowing from thesoutheast and south had hauled roundafter nightfall into the southwest Justwhile I was meditating a puff camecaught the Hispaniola and forced herup into the current and to my greatjoy I felt the hawser slacken in nrygrasp and the hand by which I held itdip for a second under wuerWith that I made my mind up tookout my gully opened it with my teethand cut one strand after another tillthe vessel swung by two Then I layquiet waiting to sever these last whenthe strain should be once more lightened by a breath of windAll this time I had heard the soundof loud voices from the cabin but tosay truth my mind had been so entirely taken up with other thoughtsthat I had scarcely given ear Nowhowever when I had nothing else to doI begau to pay more heedOne 1 recognized for the cockswainsIsrael Hands that had been Flintsgunner in former days The other wasof course my friend of the red nightcap Both men were plainly the worseof drink and they were still drinking for even while I was listeningone of them with a drunken cry openedthe stern window and threw out something which I divined to be an emptybottle But they were not pnly tipsyit was plain that they were furiouslyangry Oaths flew like hailstones andevery now and then there came forthsuch an explosion as I though twas sureto end in blows But each time thequarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for awhile until the nextcrisis came and in turn passed awaywithout resultOn shore I could see the glow of thegreat campfire burning warmly throughthe shore side trees Seme one

nearer in the darkI felt the hawser slacken once moreand with a good tough effort cut thelast fibers throughThe breeze had but littlev action onthe coracle and I was almost instantlyswept against the bows of the Hipaniola At the same time the schooner began to turn upon her heelslowly end for end across thecurrentI wrought like a fiend for I expectedevery moment to be swamped andsince I found I could not push the coracle directly off I now shoved straightastern At length I was clear of mydangerous neighbor and just as I gavethe last impulsion my hands cameacross the stern bulwarks InstantlyI grasped itWhy 1 should have done so I canhardly say It was at first mere instinct but once I had it in my handsand found it fast curiosity began to getthe upper hand and I determined Ishould have one

A W Bulletin-OI A Middle Half DiscoveryBy INA BREVOORTWAS an evening- in early spring1IT and the windows of -Mrs DarlingTons room had been opened to admitthe fresh nil laden with promise ofsummer But alas the breeze carriedwith it something- more the sound of a-violin played very badlyTheres thai dreadful noiae againYou will have to close the windowsJane said Mrs Darling ton to her maidwho laid down the curling- tongs andobeyed her mistress Mr Darlingtonturned from the silver laden dressingtable before which she sat and confronted her husband who was on theother side of the room reading his paperIts no use James she said risinganger and peulanee mingling in hertones 1 simply cant stand that noiseYou must speak to that man to-morrowMy clear answered her husband ina slightly amused tone how manylimes must 1 tell you that I should bemaking myself ridiculous The manias a right to play on his own violin inliis own housePlay Do you call that playingIt is what every beginner has to gothrough and by whatever name youchoose to call it it is nothing to whichwe have any right to object said MrDarlington If he played at unseasonable hours or if we had illness in theliquse I should -have wine excuse forcomplaininglTflness indeed And what do 3011call illness I should like to know Ifthis annoyance continues my nerveswill be worn to nothing in a short timeHer husband thought this might bea very good thing but he did not sayso He was too wise a man for thatInstead he returned to his paper andsilence reigned but not for longThere now you may go Jane I willTingwheu I want you again said MrsDarlington when the last strand waswaved and her hair had been carefullydressedWhen the maid had noiselessly leftthe room Mrs Darlington said somewhat impatiently l do wish youwould attend to me JamesWhat is it my dear said her husband mildly again laying aside hispaperWhat is it You dont listen to aword I say and Mr Darlingtons paper was not taken up again until hiswife had entered her carriage and beendriven rapidly awayThe idea of putting such a house inthis neighborhood It was a ridiculousthing to do said Mrs Darlington toher intimate friend Mrs Mason as theysat at lunch together on the followingday in the great dining room in theformers house The massive sideboardtowered above them majestically itsburden of silver and cut glas sparklingan the one ray of sunlight whichpierced through the closed blinds Theair outside was soft and fragrant bmMrs Darlingtons head ached hencethe dim lightWho owns the house and why didyou allow anyone to build there askedMrs Mason You told me once thatyou intended buying that lot for a rosegardenI did replied her friend but Ithought there was no hurry I didmotsuppose the man who owned it woulddie and leave the lot to some nephewwho would obstinately refuse a goodoffer because he wanted to build his cottage there It is a cottage nothing buta cottage she finished setting downher teacup with a force that made bothcup and saucer rattleIt certainly is a pity said Mrs Mason as they rose from the table andstrolled out to the piazza with its inviting hammocks and comfortable chairsUnconsciously they both looked overat the offending house It stood on thenext street so that its back windowsiaced the back wjndows ofestablishment and the twoyards were divided only by a light ironfenceThe little cottage was so new andclean and neat that it looked like a toyhouse Each window pane shone likea diamond in the sunlight and thewhole place frpui the porch with itslines of snowy glass towels hung alongone side to the tiny flower garden andthe lawn that resembled a pockethandkerchief was a marvel of neatnessend orderThey seem to take great pride in theI place said Mrs Darlington I haveTHE BOUEBON NEWS PARIS KY FRIDAY JUNE 17 1898been in a number of such houses whenIve been visiting my poor but theyusually look very untidy I can tell youjust what they probably have in theparlor Matting on the floor horsehairfurniture with worsted tidies one tablewith photograph albums and anotherwith a stand of wax flowers They mayhave a black walnut whatnot but Idoubt their having arrived at that distinction yet as they were only just married when they moved in four monthsago The furniture man comes probably every week and collects two dollars You see I know all about suchpeople and I feel sorry for them andI do all I can to help them but onedoesnt want them living right underones own nose finished Mrs Darlington pathetically if a little vulgarThat is the trouble with a city houseThe best street of to day is either in theslums or full of shops to morrow saidMrs Mason who only rented her owntown house Are they quiet well-behavedpeopleQuiet Well behaved echoed MrsDarlington in a high treble YVI13 theman is actually trying to learn theviolin Where h got the money to buyit is a mysteryThat must be very annoying Isntthere something you can do about itsaid the other vaguely in polite acquiescenceI ask d James to speak to him buthe says the man has a perfect right toplay on his own violin and that he is notdisturbing the peace as long as hedoesnt play in the middle of the nightor something of the sort But my mindis made up As James will do nothing1 shall take the matter in my own handsand speak to that mans wife I shalltell her the noise must be stopped andI will take her a package of tea and another of sugar which will have the effect of making her shut her husband inthe attic when he wants to play So Ishall speak to her at the first opportunity ended Mrs Darlington andthen the conversation turned to othermatter5The opportunity presented itself onthe following afternoon Upon consulting her watch as she was being drivenhome after making a round of callsMrs Darlington discovered that it wasmuch earlier than she had supposedThis was the time to go and speak tothat woman about the violin and having first stopped at her own door andsent the footman into the house to getthe tea and the sugar she directed thecoachman to drive her to the cottageShe had never seen the front of thehouse and she eyed it curiously It wassmall and square with a porch acrossthe front and a bow window at one sideand the paint was a light yellow withwhite trimmings At each window atiny awning flapped lazily in the breezeand on the norch stood some smallchairs and several palms and rubberplants in jardinieresTell John not to wait I will walkhome Mrs Darlington said to the footman as he touched the electric bell forherShe was richly and tastefully dressedand under her spring cape of silk andlace she carried the tea and the sugarThe door was opened by a young woman whom Mrs Darlington had oftenseen in the back yard attired in a neatcalico dress and a gingham apron Shenow wore a house dress which showeditself at a glance to be irreproachableIt w as not a wrapper nor wnat is calledHeaven knows why a tea gown yetthere was something in its loosely gathered folds that suggested the privacy ofhomeIs Mrs Madison at home askedMrs Darlington coldlyI am Mrs Madisou Wont you comein saiid the young woman She wastall and rather slendei with dark blueeye and great masses of light brownhair that showed care in its arrangement Her face was pretty but therewas an intellectual quality about it thatmade the beauty a secondary considerationMrs Darlingtons face was a studyas she followed the other womanthrough the hall witih if square staircase of polished wood its oak hat rackand umbrella jar to the parlor whichwas larger than one would have supposed judging by the ouHside of thehouseMr Darlington paused uncertainlyin the center of the room and lookedabout her helplessly She did not quiteknow how to beginWont you sit down Mrs Madisonsaid gentlyThe elder woman sank into a seatbut stall she could think of nothing tosay She wko had generations of culture and wealth behind her and whohad since her marriage been an acknowledged social leader was at a lossIt is a charming day is it not saidMr Madison I intended making somecalls myself this afternoon but I amglad now that T did mot because then Ishould have missed vouHow fortunate for me murmuredMrs Darlington feeling tihe othersquiet courtesy a challengeHaving broken the ice Mrs Madisonsoon put her guest at ease SlitevidcnlJy considered the call a social altair andit became harder each moment for theother to undeceive herAfter a short time Mrs Madison excused herself and went out of the roomLeft to herself Mrs Darlington lookedabout her The room seemed to be parlor library aikl music room combinedThere was a xiiano a music rack aperfectly appointed tea table severalcozy chairs and at hQjsidewasanimin en a c bookcaseShe glanced at its contents All theworks of standard writers the bestpoetry and vlie latest fiction were thereThe carpet was a soft thick moquettewith light flowers trailing ever a delicate ground the pictures though fewshowed taste in selection and the curtains at the windows were real laceMoreover the whole arrangement ofthe room produced a dainty and harmonizing effect which Mrs Darlingtonhad often studied in rain 4o nrcdnce vnher roomsMrs Madison reappeared in the curtained doorway holding a steaming kettle of burnished copper which she carried to the tea table where she proceeded to make tea which she servedto her guest in a frail cup amd saucerYou must pardon my leaving youbut you see I am maid as well asmistress and occasionally the two rolesclash she said without a trace of embarrassment in her mannerMrs Darlingtons thoughts weremauy and varied as she slowly sippedher tea and ate a cake Among otherthings she thought of the packageswhich she had so far kept successfulconcealed under her cape Had she beenforced to earn her own living she wouldno doubt have made an excellent juggler for it certainly requires dexteritytt drink tea and still keep spectatorsignorant of the fact that one has abundle under each armMrs Madison talked easily and weldIf she had a fault it was that she indulged in personalitiies about her husband but that is to be excused in onewho is still a brideHe is a dear fellow she said andso ambitious Just now he is studyingthe violin 1 hope his practice does notannoy youXot in the least replied Mrs DarliaigtonAt last she rose to go forgetting herparcels for hhe first timeAs she got up the sugar slipped fromunder her arm and fell the bag burstingas it struck the floorMrs Darlington looked from herhostess to the sugar and back again inconfusion Oh I am so sorry she beganfray dont apologize interruptedthe other brightly It is really notworth thinking about though I knowsuch accidents are very embarrassingYou see began Mrs Darlingtonagain trying to tihink of a good reasonfor making a caill with a package ofsugar under her arm I did not intendto come here when I started out Imeant to take the sugar to one of mypoor families but the day was so lovely and er I had put off coming hereso long thatI shall take the sugar up carefullyand give it to the woman who comesto do my sweeping for me Its an illwind that blows nobody good youknow so please think ix more about itand Mrs Madison resolutely talked ofsomething else until tfhe door dlosedupon her callerWell my dear said Mr Darlington that evening at dinner did 3 011 callour young neighbors to account today John told me when I inquired foryou that he had left vou a Mrs MadisonsYes I went there said his wifeWhat happened when you made yourcompalint Did she promise to makehim hang up dr fiddleI did not make any complaintAfter a brief struggle with her prideMrs Darlington told him the wholestory and at her pathetic rendering ofthe sugar incident he laughed till t hetears rolled down his cheeksWhen Mrs Madison returned -MrsDarlingtons call it chanced that MrsMason was also there Mrs Madisonscostume left nothing to be desired andher manner was easy and graciousthough she naturally followed the conversation instead of directing the choiceof topics as she had in her own homeShe accepted the ministrations ofMrs Darlingtons servants with thesame grace she had shown when openiug the door for and serving tea to thatladyWhen she had taken leave after staying just the proper length of time MrsMason turned to her friendMy dear she said is that the woman you told me had horsehair furnitureand wax flowers in her parlorI was mistaken

thewar question in the United States senate and house the idea occurred that itwas a good time to study the pronunciation of the different representatives ofthis vast countryIt was surprising to find the difference of pronunciation among the congressmen was not so marked as the difference of section would lead one to suppose for there were speakers from thenorth the south the east and the westSenator White was especially notedHe is from the extreme western slopewhere a touch of western twangmight be expected but his pronunciation was quite correct and Suggestedthe idea that he speaks French wellThe speakers from the sQuth slurredtheir pronouns and their rs andoften lost their es in the sound of uin such words as generally judgment boldest making them genully judgmunt bolduss

theAgood of their dams said TiATlen in a paper read before the KansastBreeders association A good wayto accomplish this is to place a smalltrough near their dams quarters wherelargerpigs cannot have access to it Putlittle sweet milk in this trough once ortwice a day also wash the trough oncea day to prevent it from becoming sourand stale and as soon as the pigs learnto drink the milk freely a little oil or oatmeal beans or shorts may be mixed withtie milk If this manner of treatment ispursued with the pigs it not only provesto be of great benefit to both the pigsand their dam during the first eight orten weeks of the pigs life but theycan be weaned much sooner and atthe same time do much better than ifotherwise treated Allow or rather encourage the dam to take plenty of exercise with her pigs if she does notlave the disposition to take the needed exercise provide two feeding placesa proper distance apart This willteach the pigs to follow their dam andin a short time she Avill give them allthe exercise needed which will notonly help to develop bone and inuselein the pigs but prevent their becomingtoo fat and having the thumps whichis often the case if the dam is well fedand a

1898Doing the Work Systematically andin Good Season Are Two VerjImportant ItemIn securing the best results with allcrops especially with small grains andha3r harvesting in good season is animportant itemlt is best so far as can be done tohave everything in readiness so thatthe work can be pushed along as rapidly as possible when the various cropshave reached the proper stage of maturity A little delay in getting readywhen the crop has reached the properstage will often materially affect thequality of the product There is no partof farm work more important to do justat the right time thau the harvestingOne advantage of growing a varietyof products is that the harvest is extended over a longer season affordingin this way a better opportunity forharvesting each in its proper seasonAnd where a considerable acreage isdevoted to one crop even grass it isoften best to have two or three varieties in order to lengthen the harvestseasonOrchard grass is usually the first cropto mature for harvesting- Then comered clover wheat timothy mammothclover oats and lastly red top Manyfarmers however grow only red clover wheat oats and timothy and thisof course shortens up the harvest season With all grasses and clover cutfor hay the best season for commencing to harvest is as soon as th plantshave reached full growth and thenearer the work can be done to thisseason the better the quality of thehayAs the seed forms more or less of thehay is converted into woody fiber andthis means loss of nutriment and makesa hay that is not so well relished by thestock as if cut in good seasou It is anitem in making hay of the best qualitynot to cure it too much Two hoursexposure to a very hot sun or three orfour hours vhen not so hot is sufficientwith clover better part of the curing should be done in the cockWith good haying weather two orthree hours exposure is all that isnecessary to cure with grasses Curingtoo much not only causes a loss of nutriment but makes the plants so brittlethat in handling there is an increasedwasteWheat should be cut as soon as thegrains begin to harden If cut tooearly before the grain has reached fulldevelopment it will often shrivel upin curing If allowed to become tooripe there will be loss in handling whilethe quality of the grain will be lowered When oats are to be fed in thestraw without threshing earlier cutting is advisable than when they areto
