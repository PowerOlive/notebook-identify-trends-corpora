KEEPING COOL MATTER OF SIM
PLE PRINCIPLES
Keeping cool in summer is largely
a matter of observing a few simple
jrinciples in every-day life, accord
ing to specialists in the home econ
omics department of the College of
Agriculture. A sound-minded, well
nourisbed, sensible-clothed person
will not suffer much from the heat,
the specialists state. On the other
hand persons wbo eat heartily of
winter foods, who get less than
eight hours of sleep out of every 24
and who wear badly-fitting shoes for
instance are liable to heat prostra
tion. "The housewife should take ad
vantage of the opportunity which
presents itself during the summer
months of training her family in
health and food habits. It is no
trouble to get children or adults to
take cold baths during the summer
and once started this good habit is
apt to be continued. Fruits and veg
etables are never so well received as
during their own season while tea
and coffee can be replaced daily by
the more refreshing cool fruit drinks.
"It is unnecessary for any -housewife
who is willing to plan out her
work to spend long hours in a hot
kitchen. Except in the houses where
there are a number of men doing
manual labor, and requiring heavy
food, the cooking for the day can
be done in the early morning. In
summer the protein requirements of
the diet should be filled by eggs,
milk, fish, fowl and cheese, instead
of by heavier meats. Vegetables,
particularly the succulent ones, many
of which can be eaten raw, should be
used in abundance. Fruits and ber
ries should appear as such, not com
bined with rich pastries. In can
ning by the cold pack process much
of the heat and worry of canning is
eliminated.
"The dining room should lose all
of its unnecessary draperies and
bric-a-brac, in order that dusting
may be reduced to a minimum. Very
attractive stencilled oil cloth doilies
and paper napkins not only will
make the table look and feel much
cooler, but also will save heavy
washing and ironing. All heavy rugs
should be removed in the summer.
Heavy upholstered furniture should
be covered with cool-colored chintz.
It is well to close the windows about
eight o'clock .and pull down the
shades so as to keep out the sun and
hot wind. When the windows are
opened at five o'clock or thereabouts
the house is cool and comfortable
for the evening..
"Clothing worn in the summer
should be light colored and loose
fitting. Shoes should be given par
ticular attantion. They should have
a broad, low heel, a straight inner
line and should be of kid, rather
than canvas or heavier leather.
"During the summer a great many
people make the mistake of eating
too many frozen foods and too many
iced drinks. These iced foods if
taken into the body to any extent
retard the work of the digestive
juices, thereby slowing down 'all of
the digestive processes, and ulti
mately making the person feel hotter,
rather than cooler."

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS

trict. The home will 'be improved

Southern Methodist churches of
the Lexington district have raised
nearly $100,000 of their $120,000
quota for the Educational Fund
campaign, which was instituted sev
eral weeks ago, and the remaining
$20,000 will likely be raised within
the next two months. The entire
Southern church reports that $20,-
000,000 of the $33,000,000 asked,
has been subscribed. George Wil
liams, of Winchester, is district di
rector of the campaign, and Rev. G.
E. Cameron, Presiding Elder of the
Lexington district, is in charge of
the drive locally. The First Meth
odist church of Winchester, of which
G. W. Banks is pastor, had a quota
of $25,000 and reports subscrip

PROMISES EARLY FALL AND
COLD WEATHER
With all records broken for accum
ulated totals of excess temperature
since tne nrst or the year, the
Weather Bureau is at a loss to ac
count for the absence of the normal
wind drafts from the north which
usually temper the rays of the sum
mer's sun.
It isn't the heat so much as the
length of the hot spell which has
the country complaining, Edward
H. Bow.ie, chief forecaster of the
bureau asserted.
With a very few exceptions, he
pointed out, temperatures reported
have been within normal summer
heights, but not for years have the
general averages been so high'.
Although the summer is but a few
weeks, old, Mr. Bowie called atten
tion to the great number of days in
which the mercury has touctied 90
or better.
In many of the cities where the
mercury has climbed only infre
quently over the 90 mark excessive
humidity had made the suffering as
acute as if thetemperature had been
high, and this fact is also blamed on
the absence of wind drafts from the
polar regions.
The totals of excess temperature
since the first of the year are now
climbing toward the 900 mark and,
as the law of compensation isfcrelied
upon by weather sharps in their pre-
-dictions they warn the country to ex
pect an early fall and cold winter.

the most of it," Mr. Bowief con
