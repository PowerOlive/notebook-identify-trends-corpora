MUSHROOMS A FOOD.
Wild mushrooms are a food that
should, be more largely utilized in
this country, now that food is scarc
er, according to William A. Murrill,
assistant director of the New York
Botanical Gardens, who thinks the
people should be taught how to
distinguish the poisonous from the
wholesome varieties. Wild mush
rooms are eaten in this cquntry al
most exclusively by the foreign-born
population. r

RELATING TO OTHER DAYS.
(Frankfort State Journal)
The language of Deuteronomy
XXVI is as follows:
"When a man hath taken a new
wife, he shall not go out to war,
neither shall he be charged withany
business; but he shall be free at
home one year, and shall cheer up
the wife which' he hath taken."
This injunction related to a pe
riod different fiom our own. There
was no selective draft and no need
of it because warring was pastime
and mllasfj and anyone who could
beat up a dozen or so fellows went
to war where he saw a chance of
profit. Industrial conditions -were
different from those- of to-day. Un
less a man is rich nowadays it is
out of the question for him to in
dulge in a year's holiday. When h
gets ,married he honeymoons a couple
of weeks or so and hies back to the j
office to make am for last time. The !
slackers are finding that the United
States Government regards the fact
that the ox is in, theV mire as being
of paramount importance as compar
ed with the recommendation of-Deuteronomy
that marriage absolute a
man from civil and military duty for
a twelvemonth.
