made friends with all He come in con
tact with, and did much in building
up the church, both spiritually and
in many other ways. While with us
he took his degrees in Amity Lodge,
No. 40 F. and A. M., and about two
years ago was united in marriage to
Miss Daniel, of Owenton. Last May
they rented property in Millersburg,
and our good people believed that
they were to have the most estima
ble couple with us for some time.
Mrs. Goldsmith, like her husband,
entered into all that was good on ar
riving at Millersburg, and was soon
lecognized by her church as a leader
in everything she undertook. A few
weeks ago Rev. Goldsmith received
a call from the Baptist church at
Paris, which he accepted. It is with
great pleasure that we commend this
couple to the good people of Paris,
fully realizing the fact that our loss
is their gain.
