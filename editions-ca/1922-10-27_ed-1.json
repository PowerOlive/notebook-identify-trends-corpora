1LUE GIASS LEAGUE
In -a statement given out to the
press Thomas M. Russell, of Mays--ville
president of the Blue Grass
"League, declares that the first season
-of the League has been a decided
success, and indicated by the tone of
Tiis statement that he was well
-pleased with the showing made dur
ing the season by the different clubs.
All of the clubs in the circuit, he
cstated, showed a healthy financial
Condition at the season's end, and
ach city represented in the League
has retained its franchise, and will
.he among those present when the
-jlay is resumed on the different lots
In 1923.
Lexington, whose team droppetl
out of. the league several days be
fore the season ended, will have a
franchise next year and the club's
owners are already planning to con
struct a baseball park in the down
town section of the city.
President Russell has worked un
tiringly in his endeavor to make the
Bluegrass circuit a go, and continu
ed an uphill fight in the face of
' many obstacles until he has appar
ently made a success of the venture.
-The close of the 1922 campaign
found almost every team greatly
strengthened by the acquisition of
xiew play ersN and the loop showed
great improvement in the brand of
ball displayed earlier in the season.
This in itself speaks well for the
success of the 1923 pennant-chase
:andfcif the Bluegrass League survives
two more playing seasons Central
Kentucky fans may expect to wit
ness, some fast base ball, providing,
of course, the circuit shows the same
progress it has in the 1922 season.

, PERPETUAL MOTION
(Danville Advocate)
Some tome ago, W. J. Lay, of the
Park'sville section cut his tobacco
and put it on sticks in his barn to
remain until fully cured for the
market. When he had hung one
stick in the top of the barn he
noticed that it continued to rock.
Two weeks later, some hunters pass
ing by the barn and hearing the
pecliar rocking noise began an in
vestigation but were unable to dis
cover the source. They calfed Mr.,
Lay and much to his surprise, it was
discovered that the tobacco was still
locking with as much force as when
it was placed on the top rack in the
barn.
SOFT DRINK STAND IS PUBLIC
PLACE

Those who insist on dying by
jlnches should swallow a tape line.
Judge Cochran after hearing mo
tions to squash pf esecution of sev
eral persons charged with the viola
tion of the Volstead law, at Coving
ton, after the officers had entered
their places and taken samples of
beer and otherwise investigated the
premises, held that a soft drink
stand is a public place and that the
prohibition officers have the same
right to enter as any one else. If
when in there, said the court, they
"smell" or observe the sale of bever
ages they have the right to take
sample without first having; obtain
ed a search warrant.

DIGS UP POT OF GOLD
While digging a pit for a sawmill
near Mt. Victory, in Pulaski coun
ty, it became known, Dave Jones
drove his pick into a pot containing
the equivalent of $48,000 in gold of
ancient English coinage. The pot is
in the custody of the State Banking
Commissioner at Frankfort forin
vestigation of ownership. The
money is to be kept 12 months, dur
ing which time claims may be filed
for ownership, but if these are not
properly proved Jones gets the
money, it is said.
Jones said he estimated the value
of the coins at $18,000, but the
Frankfort authorities weighed it to
ascertain its value. The pot bore
the initials "J B."
In pioneer Kentucky days this
section was the scene oftihe opera
tions of a band of robbers who killed
!a number of settlers, records show.
It is believed either that some set
tler buried the money to hide it
from them, or it was hidden there by
the robbers.
