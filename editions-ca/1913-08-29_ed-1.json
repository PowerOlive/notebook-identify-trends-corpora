y. and the Jhanhouser cast of actoi.
headed by Miss Maude Fealy, who
plays the leading part of "Iolanthe",
the King's daughter, brings around
one of the sweetest romantic stories
of ancient Denmark, showing how the
gentleness of "Tristan," her lover,
mingled wTith his kindness and love
terminates in a happy ending to one
whose life had been one of sorrow.

KEHOE MAY RUN F,OR
BURLEY PRESIDENT
RESPONDING PROMPTLY.
There has been no finer evidence of
the splendid generosity of the Bour
bon county people than the way in
I which they are meeting the payments
on the new Young Men's Christian
Asociation building. Earlier in the
week notices were mailed to all sub
scribers calling attention to the ffac
that next Monday, Sept . 1st, is the
date when the first installment is to
be paid. It is gratifying to note, how
ever, that the same spirit which mani
fested itself in the campaign last June
is still present and many of those who
made pledges have already paid them,
and nearly half of those paying paid
the full amount of their subscriptions.
It is hoped that this will continue so
that the work on the new building
may be hastened.
The pledges are payable at the'
Bourbon Bank and Trust Company,
and it is expected that practically
all subscribers wil either call and pay
or mail checks before the end of the
coming -week.
