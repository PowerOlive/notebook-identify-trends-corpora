The ffceatest claims for SSS Swift
ifi areipade by those whom it has
red and alter all the most -valuable
eptation is one which ii given by those
ittio speak from experience We could
jjgblisb a page of what we claim SSS
ml do but the people prefer thread
f what it has done and nance wegiva
the testimony of reputable well kaown
people in different parts of the country
who gladly tell of hew SSS has cured
tfem of blood diseases aftr trying
ether treatment in vain
JRfowonder SSS has such stanch
Isiends The experience of those who
tke it to day will be the same as of
tftse who twenty years ago found it the
JUy corefeood disease are obstinate
aftid cannot be cared by erne medicine
id a dozen which claims to cure them
acwhen SSS is taken with satisfactory
results after a disappointing acperi
mdbe with other remedies it is at
strange that it has grateful fcieads by
tfe score
MR WIIIIAM SOWBS
Mr William Sowers of Bradford Ohio
was cured by SSS ten years ago of a
severe blood poison and writes that to
this day no sign of the dreadful disease
has ever returned He says
I had a terrible blood disease which
5s considered incurable and was treated
for a long time by the best physicians
tut they did me no good The disease
seemed to get a firmer hold on me and
attacked my tongue and throat which
were soon full of vile ulcers
I changed doctors several times and
afterwards took nearly every blood rem
edy on the market without the slightest
benefit After five years of treatment
which did me no good whatever I was
induced to try SSS This remedy
jroved itself equal to the case for in a
iew months I was entirely cured and my
akin was perfectly clear and smooth
I could hardly believe that the cure was
permanent but ten years have elapsed
aed no sign of the disease has yet ap
peared
SSS is a sure cure for Cancer Ca
tarrh Contagious Blood Poison Scrof
vla Rheumatism Eczema and all other
blood diseases which other remedies
have no effect whatever upon It is
Purely Vegetable
and is the only blood remedy which
ia guaranteed to contain no mercury
potash or other harmful mineral SSS
