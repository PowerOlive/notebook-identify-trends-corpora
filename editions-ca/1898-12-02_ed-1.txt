willIn one of her visits to ScarboroughMrs Wharton with her usual economyhad a family pie for dinner which shedirected the footman to convey to thebakehouse This the man declined todo as not belonging to his place orrather as derogatory to his consequence The lady then moved the question to the joachman but found a stillstronger objectionTo save the pride of both MrsWharton resolved to take the pie to theshop herself She ordered one man toharness and bring out the horses andthe oiher to mount and ride behind andthus the errand was done with all honorand ceremony Then in due time thecoachman was ordered to put to a second time and the footman to mount behind and Mrs Wharton brought backthe pie in the same dignified stateNow said the lady to the coachman you have kept your place whichis to drive and you yours to the footman which is to wait and I minewhich is to have my pie for dinnerContinuous Steel PipeThe West Australian government hastaken a contract to lay nearly 850 milesof water
