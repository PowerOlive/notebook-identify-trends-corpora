that candidate tells a person herself.
No one knows not even the cam
paign manager for no record is kept
of the votes issued and given to the
contestants. All we know is the num
ber of votes that are put in the ballot
box, and this standing is published in
the paper each issue. The campaign
is run on a fair and square basis, and
every candidate will have impartial
treatment. The candidates who get
the most votes on subscriptions will
be the owners of the valuable prizes
after the campaign is over.
SPECIAL INDUCEMENT.
As a special inducement for new
subscribers, the contestants are au
thorized to make the following offer:
Every person who subscribes for the
Bourbon News between now and the
close of the contest will have his sub
acrintion dated in advance from Jan
uary 1. 1913.
iCFor,instance, if a person paid two
dollars'today, his subscriDtion would
be paid to Januaiy 1. 1914. and he
would get all the papers between now
and the first of the year free.
All persons who are in arrears
after the contest closes will be cut off
the list. A recent ruling of the post
office department forces the newspa
pers tOjkeep their subscriptions paid
in advance." Otherwise they will lose
their low mail rate and' be forced to
pay first class postage.

teveral days ago.
With the completion of the sturcture
onlv a few days off, all that remains
to complete a successful opening will
be a season for the handling of to
bacco. The local house with its many
facilities will command a great per
cent of the tobacco raised in this sec
tion, and it is expected that crop3 from
all the adjoining counties will be plac
ed on the local market.
