cents, and allowed, th'e Commissioner
of- Agriculture 3 pier pent, instead of
JTer cent, of the-jlicense tax. Coun
ty clerks have written to Attorney

the remainder of. he!term for which
they were elected to collect the 25
cent tax. The' Attorney General

,-?n violation of the section of the
Constitution that provides that tho
s'o.mpensLtion of any city, county.
Town or municipal officer shall not
fte changed after his election or
appointment, or during his term of
office, and that the Legislature had

BUILDING UP A COUNTRY TOWN
, Many newspapers will have to
suspend publication, because pro
duction and shipment of print pa
per must cease, unless the Interstate
Commerce Commission modifies its
priority orders in allocating coal
and wood cars, Philip T. Dodge,
president of the International Paper
Company, declared at New York.
In a letter appealing to tiie com-
pnission for consideration of paper
fills' needs for rail equipment to
deliver their fuel and pulp wood,
.Mr. Dodge said that more than 400
newspapers of the United States di
rectly dependent on the Internation
al Paper Company for their paper
stock now are living from hand to
mouth.
"The plants at Berlin and Frank
lin, N. H.; Niagara Falls and Wil
der, Vt., and Orono, Me., will have
to shut down if cars are not sent
soon," he said.
MOYER HAS STATES WHIPPING
POST BURNED.
One of the first official acfe of W.
H. Moyer, of New York, the new
warden of the Frankfort Reforma,
tory, was executed when the whip
ping post at Frankfort Reformatory
was burned.
The announcement of destruction
of the whipping post was greeted
with -hearty approval by the convicts.
Some people say they do not like
country life on account of the petty
spirit sometimes manifested in small
communities. They find fault with
neighborhood gossip over small af
fairs, pett Tivalries 'anJ jealonsies,
lack of cny broad outlook. v
In the past therejhave been a good
many rural communities" where this.
criticism was perfectly just. There.
are some of that type to-day, though
rot so many as formerly. j
This spirit has been tremendously
modified by developments of recent J
years. The former petty feeling was
manifested because people in their
leisure time had little else to do buc
to engage in petty gossip a-nd rival
ries. To-day the people of a progressive
country town are wide awake, and
have their minds on big tilings, jusf
as much as in large cities, probably
more. The metropolitan dweller.
vrc content to sit and watch the
crowd go by, a-nd spend their time
inactively at shbws and picture
houses. Thus they develop no initi
ative and are content to be mere
rpectators in life.
The country people of to-day, at
least in wide awake communities,
have a larger outlook von life be
cause they are doing real things
themselves, instead of watching
other people do things. Their minds
are full of' progressive business ideas
f.nd plans for community develop
ment. This shuts out the narrow
ness which the typical old fashioned
country town developed.
The petty little rivalries' of the
past thus sink out of sight. Peo
pie grow too big, too broad minded
and generous, to fret because some
other person is more popular or more
prominent. The whole character
and temper of a community changes
when it joins the march of modern
progi ess.
