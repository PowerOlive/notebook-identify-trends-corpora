CLOTHES SPECIALS
Jfn r Pockets and Things Tallm
Have to Put In Garments
No special
With that remark to the assistant
who took down the measurements the
tailor dismissed his patron and said
ifeat the suit would be finished sure
m a certain day
What did yon mean by saying no
fecial to your clerk asked the cus
tomer
Well that means that you want
your clothes made all right and without
ny crank thing about them Pockets
l the great special We have cus
jfemers who want besides the regular
pockets places in their waistcoats for
emils eyeglasses and all sorts of
Uiings Some pencil pockets are made
o hold only one pencil and some for a
tamefc Eyeglass pockets are also or
dered in keeping with the shape and
ifeyle of the glasses and pockets for
cigars are ordered for all sizes from the
Sttle half pencil shape to the great
big perfecto Freak pockets inside of
other pockets are also in demand and
ohaxnois lined pockets which we usual
ly make for the watch side of the waist
coat are ordered often for trousers by
aaen who carry silver trinkets in them
Another class of special customers
are those whose garments are made
with a view to the wearers health
Mpny men have an inner band of red
flannel put on the waist of their trou
pers as a cure for rheumatism and some
driving coats are made so that sheets
of stout paper may be slipped between
the breast lining and the cloth when
driving against the wind
On the whole said the tailor a
man in my business has the best oppor
tunity to find out the kinks and queer
points about men not only as to their
persons but their minds New York

FINERTYS SERMON
ft Bron -lit lriie From the Preuoher
Who Didut Deliver It
Before ex -Congressman John Finerty
became famous as the great American
British lion tail twister he was one of
the best reporters in Chicago He was
an The Tribune and one day a certain
sty editor best known to fame as the
dian who always wore a straw hat and
amoked a corncob pipe decided that
Mr Finerty should be disciplined
It was Saturday and sometime after
nidnight Mr Finerty was assigned to
report the morning sermon of an ob
scure minister way down on the South
Side Finerty was the senior and his
associates were thunderstruck They
Kpectud an explosion at least but
finerty remained calm and dignified
although a trifle pale Then he will
aesign they thought but Finerty
talked out and made no sign To the
surprise of every one he reported the
mext day as usual and turned in an ab
stract of the sermon Every one read it
an JiOoday niornin and it was cer
tainly an eloquent and carefully report
ed sermon
That afternoon a man of clerical cut
tailed on the city editor and asked to
see the young man who had reported
his sermon the morning before Mr
Finerty was introduced The man of
the clerical cut would like to see Mr
Finerty alone for a few moments Out
in the hallway he asked Of course
you were nut at my church yesterday
morning
No replied Finerty
Well I simply stopped to thank you
for the sermon It was far more elo
quent than the one I preached
Finerty had composed the sermon in
s neighboring cellar beer saloon on
Saturday night Lippincotts Maga

Fog Iu Photography
Oue serious and at the same time un
inspected source of fog in photography
is often due to the fact that the black
ing has slightly worn off the lens
mornt and there is a reflection which
seults in a loss of brilliancy in the
jregivc Constant use and endless
cleaning of the lent in time wear the
felr king eff and this should be attend
ed to and all metal parts kept well
blacked Win re lenses are mounted in
sluminium still more care is necessary
in this rtpea as wherever iu such
nases the blacking wears off white light
instead of yellow light is reflected into
ihe lens
Sometimes diaphragms of the iris
pattern are greatly at fault in this re
spect By reason of its construction tbe
leaves or vanes in this diaphragm are in
onstant friction while being set and
thus become polished and reflective for
which reason some photographers avoid
caving iris diaphragms in their lenses
nnvitbst9uding their convenience A
sareful examination of the apparatus
Trill insure safety in this matter Stops
fd the ordinary pattern become in time
iittle better than bare metal especially
st the edges sf the aperture

Pontic a a Hercules
I could tell you a story about strong
men photography Some of the minor
limbs of the fraternity depend on the
cunning of the camera for advertise
ment So said a photographer
One fellow who visits country fairs
and casual shows goes through tricks
of a kind wonderful to the unscientific
mind They are merely tricks after all
and his strength is a catch He depends
on his photos for advertisement In pos
ing he folds his arms tightly dilates
the muscles of his neck and lines his j
veins with prussian blue His picture
gives you Hercules in his power of maj
esty In private he is a well developed
man without any swagger of sinew or
strength
Professional strong men are as
er at make up as a society actress The
latter lavishes attention on face and
neck while breast and ribs muscles i
and throat occupy the former for hours
ere the camera confronts them A few
lines about the body add pounds to the
weight of a strong man in the pic
ture a studied pose imparts
tional formidability
The veins of a certain professional
Hercules protrude like whipcord in the j
photographic cabinet He dusts them
with powdered ultramarine and treats
the high parts of the muscles with in-
dian red Otherwise his picture would
appear quite ordinary Cincinnati

A Xiee Little Hint For George
A business man has a daughter and
also a confidential clerk and the I
dential clerk has for some time been at
tentive to the daughter but he has not
or had not a month ago sufficient
courage to come to the point though
the young woman goodness knows has
never done anything to scare him off
for he is a first class fellow in every re-
sped The other evening he was mak
ing a call and about 9 oclock her fa
ther came in I
Ah George he said how about
that deal we were talking about this
afternoon Did you see the party
Yes sir replied George and I
expected to see you this evening and
tell you about it
My dear said the father turning
to his daughter will you retire for a
few minutes George wants to speak
business for awhile
The daughter rose irp but hesitated
Whv do I have to go she asked
doubtfully
Because dear smiled the father
you are not interested Why do you
want to stay
She blushed and started out
Because papa she twittered Id
rather like to hear George talk business
just once
Then George got red and the father
looked at them both significantly and
the girl tied London Answers
Praise For the Bishop
The bishop of never mind where
being a newcomer and somewhat trou
bled with a neglected diocese thought
to inspire his clergy to take occasional
services during the week by periodically
visiting out of the way parishes and
taking one himself
On one of these occasions having
formed quite a good congregation and
having been moved to much eloquence
in his sermon he felt a little not un
natural desire to know if he had made
any impression on the usually unim
pressionable yokels and put some lead
ing questions to the old clerk who was
helping him to unrobe in the vestry
Well I hope theyve been pleased with
yer said the old man patronizingly
and Im sure we tnk it werry kind o
yer worship to come down and preach
to us but yer knaw a worsser one
would ha done for the likes o we if

Martello Tower In England
Whatever may have been the defen
sive value of martello towers a century
ago it has entirely evaporated now
There are a good many of them on the
coasts of Essex Suffolk Kent and Sus
sex These massive round towers some
40 feet high were regarded as and very
likely were splendid defenses at the
time they were erected but they have
long been used only for coastguard pur
poses Their name is derived from the
Italian coast towers which were erected
as a protection against pirates Warn
ing that a suspicious craft was in sight
was given by striking a bell with a
martello or hammer It was the power
ful defense made in 1794 by Le Tellier
at the tower of Mortella with only 38
men against a simultaneous sea and
land attack led by Lord Hood and Ma
jor General Dundas which brought
them into favor in this country It was
thought that they would be a splendid
defense against Boney London

Haunted House
The haunted house in this case
said the old college man was occupied
by a very estimable and intelligent
gentleman He did not believe in
ghosts but two nights had made him
look old and careworn and there were
certainly loud strange and startling
noises in his attic They would continue
right up to the time that some one en
tered the haunted room but the open
ing of the door was the signal for a
most oppressive silence
Half a dozen of us college fellows
asked permission to investigate and it
was gladly granted We waited till we
heard the noise and I assure you that
there was plenty of it It continued un
til we had crept up stairs but ceased
when we entered the attic We waited
there without result till big Hicks of
the football team carried out a plan
We closed the slide to the dark lantern
slammed the door noisily as though
leaving and then settled down to wait
Presently the noise began We flashed
the light in its direction and there was
a jug rolling back and forth rapidly
the handle striking the floor with a
loud thud
Must be spirits in that jug
laughed big Hicks but his laugh was a
tremolo Well see and he let go with
one of his famous kicks that shattered
the uncanny vessel Then every fellow
let out a yell and jumped as though
trying to knock a hole in the roof A
rat had crawled into the jug and had
been frantically trying to get out

The Platform Woman
The platform woman never has been
a credit to but ever a blot upon Amer
ican womanhood I make this emphatic
statement from a personal knowledge
of the homes which these women leave
behind when they go to their meet
ings writes Edward Eok in The La
dies Home Journal
I have seen the roorr of their
homes left in wild disorder I have seen
their servants sitting in idleness with
work on every hand to do I have seen
the children neglected and left to their
own devices I have heard husbands
speak in derision of the motives of their
wives No woman in a happy American
home can ever afford to Uceu to these
parasites of her sex
Fortunately the platform womans
influence is steadily on th wane She
was never a power She was never even
picturesque Her worst injury was
wrought upon certain weak women who
for the time she deluded But even
with them she was soon regarded with
wonder rather than with interest with
suspicion rather than with confidence
The disappearance of the platform wo
man is a case of a blot being blotted
out
Successive Steps In Success
The ambitious amateur went to see
the experienced theatrical manager
I want to be a star actress she
said What do you advise me to do
Hm have you ever had an affair
of the heart he asked
Well she simpered two or three
young fellows are breaking their hearts
about me
That wont quite do Go and get
your own heart broken he said and
then come again
She had heard something like thi
before and she went away with her
chin in the air
A year later however she returned
Well she said choking down a
sob I have come back to you heart
broken I married one of those youna
men He treated me shamefully ami
has deserted me I
Ah that is something like said
the manager rubbing his hands togeth
