Pullman Cars
As a railroad train was swinging
around a sharp curve a passenger in the
sleeping car was thrown against the in
side window of the stateroom so vio
lently that his elbow went through the
glass The Pullman conductor came
promptly to the rescue asking if he
was hurt
No Im not answered the passen
ger good naturedly but the Pullman
companys dividends will be cut down
this year by the price of one pane I
suppose the stockholders can stand it
though
She Pullman stockholders wont
have to said the conductor It comes
out of the X Y and Z Railroad com
pany to whose train we are attached
I shall make out n damage slip the
train conductor will certify it the re
pairs will be made at the end of the
route and the railroad company will
foot the bill Theres mighty little I
tell yon except ordinary wear and tear
that the railroad company doesnt pay
for If there Js a scratch on the side of
this car at the end of a run the X Y
and Z pays for it not the Pullman
company New York Tribune
Calmness In Emergency
Dr Weir Mitchell lecturing to a
school of nurses lately upon the neces
sity f self control in emergencies told
the following incident One of his pa
tients while in a low nervons condi
tion swallowed by mistake a dose from
the wrong bottle She shrieked out that
she was poisoned One of the nurses
screamed Aconite and began to cry
hysterically The other nurse seeing
that the patient was going into convul
sions from terror when relief would be
impossible said coolly Dont be fright
ened Look here taking a mouthful of
the dose herself She then went outside
to rid her mouth of it procured an
emetic and sent for a doctor and a stom
ach pump Her calmness saved the life
of the patient
Singing and Milking
In Switzerland a milkmaid or milk
man gets better wages if gifted with a
good voice because it has been
ered that a cow will yield one fifth more
milk if soothed during the milking by a
pleasing melody
The Missouri supreme court declared
that the law as inst opium smoking
and opium joints is uncontitutional be
cause it interf xeswith the right of
men to smoke v hatever they choose
Every seventh person in the United
KiTl 1 is a Londoner

WITH THREADS OF MEFAL
Tinsel Fabrics and the More CostraBro
cades of Gold and Silver
Tinsel fabrics are the lower priced of
the cloths into which gold or silver
threads have been woven In tinsel fab
rics the gold threads are of brass or cop
per gilded and the silver threads are
of white metal These threads of metal
originally fine wire are rolled flat and
burnished and they glisten in thefabric
wherever the pattern brings them to the
surface Tinsel fabrics are made about
three fourths of a yard in width and
they sell at 75 cents to 250 a yard
They come in various colors and many
of them are beautiful and artistic in de
sign Some are copies of old Venetian
tapestries Tinsel fabrics are used for
church and for theatrical purposes and
sometimes for gowns and for decorative
purposes
The costlier fabrics with interwoven
metal threads are called gold and sil
ver brocades In these the gold threads
are of silver gold plated and the silver
threads are of pure silver the body of
the fabric is of silk The brocades are all
beautiful and many of them are ex
ceedingly so These fabrics are made
about five eighths of a yard in width
and they sell at various prices up to 25
and sometimes as high as 50 a yard
The costliest of these fabrics are very
rarely imported into this country bro
cades at 10 and 12 a yard being about
the highest priced used here If more
elaborate fabrics are required they are
usually imported to order The finer
fabrics with metal threads are made
in France the commoner kinds in Ger
many
Gold and silver brocades are here
used almost exclusively for church pur
poses and chiefly for vestments They
are imported in red violet and green
and also in black with silver threads
the black and silver being for mourning
Gold and silver brocades are also used
to a limited extent for decorative pur
poses
Such fabrics and gold embroidery
often of the costliest description are far
more commonly used in Europe than
here both 1 1 church and formilitary
