William J Bryansopposition to the tariff This brought Senators Mantle Allen and Stewart to the defense of Mr Bryan Mr Teller was drawn intothe controversy and in a few incisive remarks warned his

incident of this kind It waswhile I was traveling across the plainswith a bull train outfit carrying supplies for Gen Albert Sidney Johnsonsarmy that was sent against the Mormons A train consisted of 25 wagonsall in charge of one man who wasknown as the wagon master The second man in command was the assistantwagon master There was an extrahand the night herder and the cayallarddriver whose duty it was to drive thelame and loose cattle The whole trainwas denominated a bull outfit Everything at that time was called an outfit and at the present time the paraphernalia of the hunter who goes outon a hunting excursion is called by thesame nameWhen the train struck the SouthPlatte river we found the country alivewith buffaloes Vast herds of thesemonarchs of the plains were roamingall around us and we lay over one dayfor a grand hunt The next day wepulled out of camp and the train wasstrung out a considerable length alongthe road which ran near the foot of thesand hills two miles from the riverBetween the road and the river we sawa large herd of buffaloes grazing quietly they had been down to the streamfor a drink At the same time we observed a party of returning Calif ornianscoming from the west They too noticed the buffalo herd and in anothermoment thej were dashing down uponthem with terrific speed The buffalohercl stampeded at once and broke downthe hills So hotly were they pursuedby the hunters that several hundreds ofhem ruslied through our train pell mellfrightening both men and oxen Someof the wagons Avere turned clear aroundand many of the terrified oxen attempted to run to the hills with the heavywagons attached to them Othersturned around so short that brokethe wagon tongues off Nearly all theteams got entangled in their gearingand became wild and unruly so that theperplexeddriverswereunabletomanagethem The buffaloes the wagons andthe drivers were soon running inevery direction and there was certainly no lack of excitement Many ofthe cattle broke their yokes and stampeded One big buffalo bull becameentangled in one of the heavy wagonchains In his desperate efforts to freehimself he not only snapped the strongchain in two but broke the ox yoke towhich it was attached and the last seenof him he was running toward the hillswith the yoke hanging from his hornsA dozen other equally remarkable incidents happened during the short timethat the frantic buffaloes were playinghavoc with our train When they gotthrough and left us our outfit was badly crippled and scattered Col WilliamF Cody in N Y IndependentCEREALS USELESS FOR INDIAA Letter Sliowinj the FutilityofSending Wheat and CornSenator Chandler has received a letter from George A Kittredge concerning the proposed relief expedition forIndia and says from his knowledge ofthe conditions the proposed expeditionof corn and wheat will be impracticableand saysthere is no organization in India for the distribution of food andthat the famine districts are scatteredfrom the Madras presidency at thesouth to the Punjaub in the northIt would be almost impossible hesaysto divide alargequantity otgrain among the needy The grainwould go to India in bulk but there areno elevators there or other means ofreceiving it in that form It must beput into bags the bags must be boughtand the grain filled in the bags on boardthe steamer Apart from the expenseof the bags I do not see how the bagscould be filled in that climate in theholds of steamersThere is the expense of sending thegrain to India and after its arrival ata port the expense of railway freightheavy in India of sending it up country A theory has been promulgatedin India that the plague arose fromwheat The result is that no wheat orflour will be received in other parts ofIndia from Bombay The authoritiesin Calcutta have forbidden the receiptof flour ground at flour mills at Bombay Under no circumstances therefore must the grain be sent to Bombay If before its arrival in India theplague should break out in Calcuttathis city would be put into the sameposition and the grain would have toremain there Very few of the peopleof India have ever seen Indian cornThey would have no means of grindingit nor would they know how to cookit Wheat too is used by comparatively few of the peopleHe suggests that if the contributionsare sent m the form of money it wouldbe distributed in p manner to be ofsome use

to Brooklyn Peopleof the Vanity of All Earthly HopesI have been told said the Brooklynman that Mr Martin the chief engineer of the bridge studied for the ministry once I dont suppose that this isreally true Most things you hearabout the bridge are not true For instance there is that story that something is going to be done sometime torelieve the crush of travel during therush hours Of course no sensible manwould believe such a story now and -anyonewho would pay attention to itdoesnt deserve any better fate thanto have to cross the bridge daily at sixp m Thats the way with about every-thing you hear about the bridge thereisnt a word of truth in itBut the reason I mention the storyabout the early religious training ofMr Martin is that it is characteristicof the true purpose of the bridge andof the religious flavor that clings aboutit People usedito think that the bridgewas built to take people home to Brook-lyn or to enable them to get away fromBrooklyn Since it was discovered thatthis idea was all wrong and that itwasnt meant for any such thing somepeople have never been able to understand it The truth is that the bridgeis intended as a great moral lessonand Mr Martins early religious education if he ever had any would makehim just r man for the place Doyou see how nicely the facts fit thistheory Thus a course in engineeringwould fit a man better than a theological education to run a big bridge thaiwas merely a bridge but on the otherhand you would expect frequent breakdowns on a big bridge managed by aformer theological student intent onthe spiritual regeneration of his fmenThe moral lesson of the bridge Ohtthat is plain enough Go down to Fulton ferry Brooklyn side and look upThere you get the best view- of thobridge It suggests the straight andnarrow path It also suggests that thobest way to use the bridge if you arenot seeking moral lessons is to takethe ferry The moral pointed out bythe bridge is the vanity of all earthlyhopes Did you see thatthe trusteestook out that elevator the other dayWell that was part of the morallessonThey left it there long enough foreverybody to see it and get an ideathat some day he wouldnt have to walkup all these steps to the cars and thenwhen hope was brightest they blasteciit by removing the elevator 27o I dontbelieve that it was done of malice andpure cussedness and desire to teasoBrooklyn people The intention waasimply to chasten and subdue the spirit -Itwas simply in line with the so calledimprovements on the bridge The workwas dragged along for two or threeyears and everybody kept telling hisneighbors in the scrimmage on thoplatform at night that the good timewas coming when there would be plentyof cars and no crowding Well the improvements are all finished and thecrowding is just as bad as ever I believe they pretend there is 15 secondsless headway between trains but thecars are the same old tsardine boxesIo it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the bridge is intended toteach Brooklyn people that hi thisworld disappointments are alone certain and that earthly hopes are vainand Mr Martin is apparently just theman for superintendent even if it isnot true that he once studied foe theministry X Y Suna woman toHprT Jsi-- vCompensationTraveler I understand that Vgales are never heard here in Scotland tjSative No but we have some of thefinest

Christmas a young fellowspends in the army is one he is apt toremember What he did in years before or of what nature werethe festivities in those that followed may ircourse of time become but vague andshadowy pictures before the mindseye After something like 20 years ofservice as a commissioned officer MrLambert was heard to say that nevereven wlien a homesick plebe at WestPoint had he passed so forlorn aChristmastide as that which immediately succeeded his graduationThe rain was beating down in sullenshower upon the bare and drippingwooas and sodden fields the roadswere deep in mud camp of which hewas once more commander was wetand cold and cheerless in the adjoiningtent lay his senior officer groaning ona bed of pain hands and face blisteredand bandaged hair and eyebrows gonewhile over across the way a pile oscorched and blackened timbers acouple of brick chimneys and the stonefoundations were all that were left ofWalton HallThe story brought in of the big rowit Vernon though exaggerated hadbeen sufficiently confirmed in thecourse of an hour or so that wintryevening of Lamberts last visit to thehomestead to warrant his being ordered thither with half the companyto support the civil authorities in restoring peace Close reported thesituation by telegraph to departmentheadquarters and the action taken byhim his dispatch reaching the generalcommanding the next day an hour orso after that official had been orderedfrom Washington to send full particulars of the disturbance in his bailiwickfor the federal officials in the south andthe partisans of both sides of the

horsemen convoyingan old carriage containing WaltonScroggs seriously wounded and a doc-tor With the escort Lambert heldbrief parley also with the woundedman who thougli weak was full ofpluck and spirits his sole anxietyseemed to be on the score of his wifeand the shock the news wpuld causeher Theyaccount giyen the young officer of the circumstances leading up tothe facts differed radically from thatwith which he and his commander hadthus far been favored This was to beexpected as up to this pointheir soleinformants were either negroes or acouple of whites of the Parmelee stampIn the north as a rule the affair appeared to have been a wanton and unprovoked attack by Walton Scroggs andhis friends upon some negroes who hadbeen instrumental in securing his arrest nothing short in fact of a redhanded act of vengeance as was evident from the fact that immediately onhis release he and his party armed tothe teeth had ridden over to Vernoninstead of going home and withoutwarning or apparent warrant had begun the indiscriminate shooting downof certain unpopular whites and theirluckless negro supportersIn the south except among certainjournals published in the interest ofthe radical republican party the other side of the story was promptly circulated Capt Scroggs and a friendendeavoring to reach home by a circuitous route so as to avoid trouble afterhis release from jail where he hadbeen incarcerated several weeks onbaseless trumped up charges were setupon in the streets of Vernon by ablackguardly pack of loafers insultedabused and assaulted and finally compelled in self defense to draw their revolvers not r however until they hadbeen fired upon One odd circumstanceconnected with these perennial shootingscrapes in those days was the fact thatin footing up the score it was alwaysfound that five negroes toone white wasabout the proportion of casualties Thismay have been due to the fact that theratio of black to white in every scrimmage was about five to one or else thatthe Caucasian being cooler and longskilled in the use of arms was moreeffective in close combat At all eventswhen impartially investigated it wasfound that this Vernon difficulty differed from its fellows in no particularexcept one that it had no politicalsignificance whatever Waltonsfriends rejoicing with him in his release from durance vile did so after thefashion of the day and more or less badwhiskj was consumed before the stagereached Vernon where more friendstwere met more treats exchanged andwhere as the devil of mischief wouldhave it he happened into the bar ofthe old tavern just at the moment whentwo or three others ajl -white were happening out One of these was an oldtime admirer of Esther Walton a manwith whomScroggs had been at outsfor years There was a jostle unintenrtional a sneer in the careless apologyand a rankling word or two Peacemakers drew the principals apart Indeed Walton was too happy to continuehis journey home and Esther wards tocare to quarrel But his rivals heartand brain were burning and moreliquor made matters worse The horseswere being brought around from thestable with the troop of vagrant negroes loafing after when despite theefforts of his friends the half drunkenman came lurching out of a neighboringsaloon and with savage oaths rushedat Walton demanding satisfactionWeapons were drawn and shots exchanged on the instant and one of thescattered mob of negroes fell dead witha bullet tlirough his heart while f o amoment Walton with smoking pistolstood alone looking down at his assailant writhing on the sidewalkFriends rushed in carried one man intothe drug store and crowded Walton into the tavern bar It was fair fiffhtJie nao drawn only in self defense Hisassailant was to blame and there wasno man to suggest arrest But he stoodthere pale and unnerved now coveredwith sorrow at the disaster to the manwho even though no friend was popular well and widely known and according to the somewhat accessiblestandard of the state and day a perfect gentleman It was characteristicof the time and place that nobodyhappened to think of the dead negroiAmong these poor people WaltonScroggs was perhaps deservedly unpopular The other man open handedgenerous easj going had won not alittle of their unreasoning yet enthusiastic regard It was while Scroggswith two advisers was seated sad andtrembling in a little room of the tavernawaiting the result of the doctors examination of his fainting foe that acitizencame rushinsr in Scrofnrsyoull have to get out of this quickThere was a meeting of that old Grantand Colfax club going on up the streetand the niggers have rushed in and toldcm you killed Pete Jackson Thewhole gang of em are comingComing They were already thereWith furious yells and vengeful threatsa surging crowd of negroes came tearing along the village street stoppingonly a moment to verify the death oftheir friend and too late now for explanation or denial they swarmedmadly into the office demanding Waltons body The battle was on in an instant a battle for life a GO seconds warof races white against black as it hadto be since none wrould listen to reasonand superior nerve and aim told Pistols and

and irretrievably ruinedLook said he mournfully Themwas my best pantsThen it was found that not only hadthe strange old fellow lost his hair andbeard and not a little of the cuticle ofhis face and

Closein the past The doctor stayed longerby the silent sufferers cot carefullystuclying his face as far as it could beceen Professional etiquette preventedhis saying anything that might be areflection on the treatment and practiceof the contract surgeon yet it wasplain to Lambert and to Potts toothat he was disturbed Close howeverseemed to think less of his own xlightthan of that of the Waltons who

allwas already out of danger Close beggedthe doctor for full particulars not onlyas to how they were but how they expected to git along through the winter and at last said he wished to speakto him alone whereat Potts and Lambert wondering left the tentIt was long before the doctor cameforth and when he did he called theyoung officer aside a quiver in his voiceand a queer moisture about his

the clav soil we rounded or turnpiked the road well up from each sidefrom two and one half to three feet onthe sand road not quite so much Onthe top we placed clay about a footthick in center so water would runoff into ditch on either side therebyleaving roadbed free from standingwater The first and principal point inpermanent roadmaking is to keep the-water off - Graveling is another important thing -unless done right the roadwill be made even worse than beforeAbout eight yards of gravel to the rodshould be used as free from stones aspossible Would throw out all largestones when drawn and have smallones raked off once or twice during diefirst two or three years filling the rutsby raking or scraping with roadscraperBegin yourv roadmaking at the farthest point away in your road

charming characteristics and makes a verypleasant companion For one thing heis not easily mislaid and he is veryobedient to the slightest hint given byhis mahoutIn speed he is scarcely a record breaker but he can get over the ground inhis shuffling way a the rate of 15miles an hour when he likesThere is one thing that he is not heis not a really cleverhnimal in spiteof all the tales in the story books to thecontrary otherwise he would not sufferhimself to be so easily captured in thekheddahs the huge forest inclosures into which the hunters drive the herds ofelephants for the purpose of captureAll the actions which are apparentlyspontaneous on the part of the workingelephant are really performed at thebidding of the mahout The driver onhis neck directs every movement bypressure of the knee and as thelnausknees are concealed under the elephantsears it is very easy to imagine that theelephant thinks for LimselfWhen the mahout elects for a changeto sifc on the saddle or pad he driveswith his feet and the dullest eye candetect how a rub of the heel on theright shoulder turns the elephant to theleft and vice versaAfter his tractability his gentleness iste elephants most marked characteristic The mahout takes cruel advantageof his disposition sometimes thrashinghim on the toe nail with a billet ofwood or if free from risk of discoveryby his European master pricking histrunk with a spear till blood flowsAn elephant has rarely been knownto retaliate save when it must Whenthat curious madness comes on him noone dares approach him in his picketsIf he be taken in must and the fact escape notice the consequences are likelytofce awkward at least vIn a suburb of Eanguu an elephantbelonging to a firm of rice merchantswas one afternoon taken down to theriver for his usual bath after work Hehadthe mahout said been dull allday and seemed out of sorts He was inmust He signified the fact by seizinghis mahout and tossing the astonishedman irto the water then he ran intothe go down close by andwith onesqueal dismissed some 200 coolies atwork thereThe go down was a huge palisadeshed covering over an acre and was fullof loose paddy unhusked rice andstacks of bags and grain For two nightsand two days that elephant enjoyedhimself among those stacks Spearmenposted round the palisade wall kepthim in and one might have supposed 40elephants bent on mischief had beenthere instead of one mad one At lasthe was made prisoner with the aid oftwo big tuskers and chained np untilsuch time as heshould recover himselfLondon SketchLIFE IN THE POLAR SEASPlenty of Bears Birds and VarwhalsMillions of Fiddlers and FleasIt is evident according to JSTansenthat the waters of the polar seas are farfrom being deserted by living creaturesWherever the sea is open or partially soseals narwhais and birds abound andon the heaps of ice near the edge of thewater the bears are numerous Underthe ice marine animals are not wantingThe explorers found in abundance littlecrustaceans whose discovery was theresult of an accidentOne day the cook sunk a piece ofmeat in a hole which he had cut in theice with a view of thawing it out Thatis a method often resorted to for thepurpose of sparing the fuel Forty eighthours afterward while taking out themeat the cook was astonished to findan immense number of little animalsthat dropped upon the surface of the iceand commenced to jump about likefleas Nansen who is a professor ofzoology had no trouble in recognizingthose little crustaceans which may beseen jumping in the sand and whichare called sand fleas He was delightedat the discovery because the creaturesare good to eat although they containbut little nourishmentA few months later on when in 78or 80 degrees north latitude in October that is to say at the beginning ofthe long winter night he fished up in alittle net with close meshes a quantityof little crustaceans This proves thatlife is by no means suspended under theice on the contrary it is very activeIn the mud of the bottom where Jhewater is shallow there are numerousstarfish mollusks worms sponges andseveral species of Crustacea Journades DebatsThe Roman FishermanA traveler in Rome tells of a citizenwho was evidently too lazy to sit onthe bank of the Tiber and fish after themanner of the ordinary fisherman butinstead arranged his apparatus in theform of automatic nets which are madeto revolve by the aid of weights andthe current of the stream so that it isnot necessary for him to visit the spotoftener than once a day With the aidof a pneumatic tube to shoot the fishfrom the bank to his house it
