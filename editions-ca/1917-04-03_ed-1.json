is greater than most .people eve

"makes me to wonder" is whether

effective than to adopt a resolution.

: according to plans which Confederal o
veterans are now trying; to bring to
completion.
A tract of twenty-two acres near
Fairview, which originally formed a
part of the farm upon which Jefferson
Davis was born was acquired several
years ago by Colonel A. S. Cunning
ham, of Nashville, Tenn., publisher of
the "Confederate Veteran," and Gen
eral Bennett H. Young, who was four
times elected commander-in-chief of
the United Confederate Veterans. They
raised about $20,000, converting th-i
tract into the Jefferson Davis Park,
and it is upon a summit of this park
that it is proposed to erect the monu
ment. General George W. Littlefield.
j of Austin, Texas, announced that he
de-!will guarantee an amount sufficient to
insure the completion of the project
if others would assume a fair share
and General Julian S. Carr, of Durham
N. C., has agreed to assume a further
large share of expense. In the mean
time, a campaign for further funds is
in progress, and designs for the monu
ment have been prepared with the in
the interior for the storing of relics
It is planned to have the shaft com
pleted some time early in the coming
autumn and to, dedicate it October 22,
1917.
The site of the monument is onlyafter the Deaver case had been dis
about 100 miles, as the crow flies, from
over the cabin in which Abraham Lin
coln was born.
BELGIAN RELIEF WORK.
nounces the receipt of a cable staling
.'that another relief steamer had arrived
hn Rotterdam, passing through the
I German blockade unmolested.
telegraphed as follows:
diplomatic officials and of workers of
the Belgian Relief Commission will not
hinder nor disturb the distribution or.
food supplies. The Dutch authorities
and Relief Committees who are taking
over the work of the Belgian Relief
Commission are competent and under
stand the situation and are certain to
carry on the work with efficiency."
Mr. Gibson, owing to his long resi
dence in' Brussels, both before and af
ter the declaration of war, and his
present position as First Secretary to
the American Embassy at London, is
particularly well qualified to give au
thoritive judgment on this matter.
GOOD ROADS AND
PERISHABLE PRODUCTS
Every man who has anything tp
take to market is interested in good
roads, but the man who has perishable
products has a special interest. Every
reader who will have strawberries o'1
peaches or tomatoes or any similar
product of short life and small ca
pacity to resist jolts knows that he
must get his product to market just
as soon as it is marketable, and also
that he must get it there in good
shape if he would get a good price for
it. If the roads are so muddy that he
cannot get to town his stuff spoils on
the farm. If thoy are so rough th2
produce is shaken up and bruised, it.
is spoiled on the road.
The fruit grower and the trucker
should be good roads enthusiasts of
the most enthusiastic type.
POSTMASTER PANE WILL
RECEIVE RECRUITS FOR NAVY
Every postmaster in the country n
a recruiting officer for the United

want to anhwer Secretarv Daniel's an-
peai for men by enlisting should cal'
nn Postmaster j. Waiter Pnvne at the
locai postoffice, who will see that they
reach a navy recruiting station prop-
erly. It is expected that there will he
