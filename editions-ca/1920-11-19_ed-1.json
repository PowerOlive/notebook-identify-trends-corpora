BLUM GRASS GASOLINE
Meets the test and becomes more popular as cold
weathor arrives, because it starts quicker and.
gives more general satisfactory results at a
time and under conditions when a good gasoline
is appreciated.
We are thoroughly convinced of the supe
rior quality of Blue Grass Gasoline and are anx
ious for our f siends to make a trial comparison
with it and any other gasoline they may be
using, feeling CDnfident that they will become a
regular user of Blue Grass Gasoline because it
