MILLERSBURG ITEMS.
The class in impression at M. M. I.,
assisted by Misses Julia Carpenter and
Martha Smith, save a two act comedy
Monday night at the diill hall entitled
"Higher Education." It was full of
humor from beginning: to finish ana
kept the audience convulsed with
laughter from the time the curtain
went up until it went down on the last
act. The characters were all well se
lected and everyone seemed to be at
home in his or her part. It was one of
the best pieces ever put on by Mrs.
Best and all of her work in the past
has been more than good. This, loo,
in view of the fact that the work was
put on with less than two weeks'
preparation. The musical program
was also good. Tne piano duet by
Capt. Freas and Miss Mary Bingham,
the latter a pupil of the Cincinnati
Conservatory of Music, the vocal solo
by Mrs. Hanger, of Richmond, and the
mandolin solo by Cadet Snow all de
serve mention. At the close of the
entertainment an informal reception
was held on the verandas and in the
library of the main building1, which
the vast audience attended.
Tuesday morning at 10 :30 the com
mencement exercises were held. The
audience was good and at the appoint
ed time the faculty and uclass of 1911
consisting of six cadets, wended their
way to the stage. The musical pro
gram was good, especially the piano
solo of Miss Mary Bingham and the
vocal solo of Capt. Howard Freas.
The orations were delivered by Cadet
Jacoby, of Hutchison, second honor
man, and Cadet Freas, of Baltimore,
Md.. first honor man. These orations
were far above the ordinary and hav
ing been coached by Mrs. Best they
were "tripped of much of the school
boy features which usually attend such
occasions. Cadet Freas proved him
self not only a speaker but an orator
and we see before him a bright fu
ture. The baccalaureate addressjwas de
livered by Prof. Melcher, of State
University, of Lexington. It was
plain and practical, full of thought and
addresses to the class and cadets.
Dealing along the line of man, his pos
sibilities, and his education, he exem
plified the remarks by keeping before
the audience two educators showing
that they had devoted thier whole life
to them and pointing out great men
that now occupy high places, who be
gan their education under their watch
cs?ei, At the close of his address Col.
Best in a few appropriate remarks de
livered the diplomas to the following
cadets: Freas, Baltimore, Md., first
honor man, Jacoby. Hutchison, Ky.,
second honor man, Snow.Tampa, Fla.,
Davis, Maysville, Curry, Myers and
Barton, Millersburg, after which the
honor roll was read. At 12:15 a fur
lough was taken until September. 13,
thus cloisng one of the most successful
years in the hitsory of the institution,
depsite disadvantages in sickness un-'
der which it was compelled to labor.
Cadet J. B. Maicum of Jackson, the
youngest boy in schooi, and who is but
nine years of agn, received an average
