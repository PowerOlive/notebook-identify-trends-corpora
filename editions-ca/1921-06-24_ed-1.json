The lure of jazz music was ex

The speaker outlined dangers to

"In treating some of the Boston
runaway girls who find themselves in
New York I always sympathize with
them," she said. "Many of them have
a dull, inactive life at their work
and have no recreation."

TIN'S FORT.
To-day will be a notable one in the
history of the local D. A. R. orga
niation, Jemima Johnson Cheptef,

sition and dedication of a granite
marker on the site of the historic
old Martin's Fort, near Ruddles

speaker, and who will on this occa
sion give much history of local inter
est. At the conclusion of the exer
cises, the weather permitting, the

The scene of this interesting event
is three miles from Paris by way of
the Cynthiana pike, at the east side

ed effort by the British to wipe out
the Kentucky frontier forts at that
time. Martin's Fort was one of the
largest fortified points in the State.
