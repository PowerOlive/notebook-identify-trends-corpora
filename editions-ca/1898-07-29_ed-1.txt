following official statement ismade4The French ambassador on behalfof the government of Spain and bydirection of the Spanish minister offoreign affairs presented to the president Tuesday afternoon at the whitet house a message from the Spanish-government looking to the termination of the war and settlement ofterms of peaceThe interview between the Frenchambassador and the president was arranged for between Secretary Day andSecretary Thiebaut of the Frenchembassy both of whom werecnt at the white house when theconference began at 330 oclock Itwas still in progress at 4 oclock Theconference it is believed refers topeace negotiations but no particularsare obtainableSpains communication presented byAmbassador Cambon is general interms and does not make any distinctproposition as to Cuba the Philippines or any other possession It is simply a request that peace negotiationsbe opened 2So armistice is proposedAfter Ambassador Cambon submittedthe proposal a general talk followedbetween him the president SecretaryDay and M Ehiebaut The presidentreserved his answer an under 1standing being reached that he wouldat once lay the subject before thecabinet and then invite M Cambon toanother conference at the whitehouse when the final answer will begiven as to the willingness of this government to open negotiationsThe manner in which peace negotiations shall be co ducted in case theUnited States accepts Spains tenderlias not been determined upon but itis understood that the method likelyto be adopted is to have Gen HoracePorter United States ambassadorat Paris and Senor Leon CastilloSpanish ambassador at Paris carryforward negotiations from the pointarrived at by the president and Ambassador CambonWashington July 27 During thelate afternoon and evening the presiident conferred with most of the members of the cabinet and the Spanishproposition for peace was thoroughlycanvassed Secretaries Day Alger andXiong were at the white house duringthe afternoon and in the evening thepresident was joined by SecretariesBliss and Wilson and Postmaster Gen-eral Smith There was no cabinetmeeting in the ordinary sense butthese talks with individual membersserved about the same purpose as aformal meeting It was understoodthe president would be prepared togive an answer within the next fewdays and certainly before the nextregular cabinet day on Friday No intimation came from any official sourceas to the probable character of theanswer There were strong intimations however that there would be noacceptance which would imply the stopping of the war wrhen the Americanarms were adding victories on victories and the embarking on a vague diplomatic negotiation It was felt thatthis government had everything to losein a subtle game of diplomacy inwhich the only certain elementwould be the inaction of our army andnavy For this reason there was adisposition in official quarters to knowwhat terms were in sight before entering upon general negotiations Aprominent administration official saidafter talking with cabinet officers thatin his opinion the situation was notmaterially changed by the Spanishproposition and that the war wouldToe pressed with unabated vigor untilsomething more tangible in the wayof peace terms was at handIn case the peace negotiations areopened the means by which they willbe carried on are not determined norhave they been

beingrepresented by Senor Leon Castillo theSpanish ambassador to Paris and theUnited States by Gen Horace Porterour ambassador to Paris Senor Castillois one of the foremost diplomats ofEurope and since the war began hischief mission has been to go from capital to capital and endeavor to awakenforeign intervention in behalf ofSpain Failing in this he has turnedhi3 attention to the peace movementas the last chance for saving his country Castillo is a linguist speakingEnglish so that the negotiationscould proceed with facility Whilenot a veteran in diplomacy GenPorter is regarded as able and tactfuland moreover he would be guided byvery explicit instructions from Washington This plan is quito tentativehowever and it is rather doubtfulwhether the United States governmentwould consent to have such importantnegotiations removed so far from Washington and conducted in a Europeancapital where the atmosphere mightnot be conductive to forwarding thedesires of this countrySpains peace proposal excited thedeepest interest throughout Washington and for the time being war newsgave way to animated discussion of theprospects for peace This was particularly true in diplomatic circles Themove of the French ambassador tookthe other members of the corps completely by surprise as they had wellknown among themselves that all peacetalk up to this time had been fancifuland they had no reason to expect thatmove would take definite shape soquickl3r Several of the foreign representatives made inquiries of the statedepartment as to the meaning of theFrench ambassadors call and learning that he had presented Spains proposal for peace full reports werecabled to the foreign offices Thematter was considered of such momentthat the cable report to one of the foreign offices cost several hundred dollarsSAMPSONS REPORTThe Navy Department Makes Public theAdmirals Account of the Destruction of Cerveras FleetWashington July 27 The navy department Tuesday made public the reports of Adm Sampson CommodoreSchley Capt Clark of the OregonCapt Evans of the Iowa on the battle of July 3 which resulted in the destruction of Cerveras squadron Thereports are quite lengthy and the details of the naval battle are aboutthe same as heretofore published bythe newspapersSampsons flagship the New York was fourm iles east of her blockading station and aboutseven miles from the harbor entrance Shehad started for Siboney where Sampson intended to land accompanied by several of hisstaff and go to the front to consult with GenShafter When the Spanish squadron appeared at the mouth of the harbor the remaining vessels were in or near their usual blockading positions distributed in a semi circleabout the harbor entranceThe men of our ships in front of the portwere at Sunday quarters for inspectionThe signal was made simultaneously from several vessels Enemys ships escaping andgeneral quarters was sounded The mencheered as they sprang to their guns and firewas opened probably within eight minutes bythe vessels whose guns commanded the entrance The New York turned about andsteamed for the escaping fleet flying the signal Close in toward harbor entrance and attack vessels and gradually increasing speeduntil toward the end of the chase she wasmaking 16 knots and was rapidly closing onthe Cristobal ColonShe was not at any time within the range ofthe heavy Spanish ships and her only part inthe firing was to receive the undivided firefrom the forts in passing the harbor entranceand to lire a few shots at one of the destroyersthought at the moment to be attempting to escape from the GloucesterThe skilful handling and gallant fighting ofthe Gloucester excited the admiration of everyone who witnessed it and merits the commendation of the navy department She is afast and entirely unprotected auxiliary vesselthe yacht a good batteryof light r f gunsThe rescuing of prisoners f including thewounded from the burning Spanish vesselssays Sampson was the occasion of some ofthe mo st daring and gallant conduct of theday The ships were burning fore and aftthei r guns and reserve ammunition were exploding and it was not known at what momentthe fi re would reach the main magazines Inaddition to this a heavy surf was running justinside of the Spanish ships But no risk deterred our officers and men until their work ofhumanity wis completeThe Cristobal Colon was not injured by ourfiring and probably is not much injured bybeaching though she ran ashore at high speedThe -beach was so steep that she came off bythe working of the sea But her sea valveswere opened and broken treacherously I amsure after her surrender and despite ail effortsshe sank When it became evident thatshe could not be kept afloat she was pushedby the New York bodily upon the beachthe New York stern being placed againsther for this purpose the ship being handledby Capt Chadwick with admiral judgmentand sank in shoal water and may be savedHad this not been done nhe would have gonedown in deep water and would have been to acertainty a total lossWhen all the work was done so well saysthe report it is difficult to discriminate inpraise The object of the blockade of Cerveras squadron

initiation of overtures for peace has had theeffect of suspending in a large measure for the time being at least interest in the military and naval situation Though it is known through theopen admission of the members of theadministration that the present peacephase would remain unchanged until after another cabinet meeting on Friday there was still evinceda disposition to discuss this matter inits every aspectNaturally the first point of inquirywas the exact shape taken by theSpanish presentation of TuesdayCuriosity on this point vemained Tingratified and must probably so continue for some days to come the president having decided that nothingmore definite than the statement issued from the white house Tuesdayshall be given to the public at thistime The motive is a prudential oneand the president has even goneso far as to suggest to the Madrid authorities the expediency ofkeeping the text of the Spanish overture from publication at this timeThe next point of interest was thecharacter and extent of the demandlikely to be made by the United Statesas the condition of peace It is feltthat the statement of terms of peaceboth from Spain and from the UnitedStates may be some days off as theredoubtless will be considerable diplomatic fencing at the outset before theactual point of stating terms isreached A good deal of thisfor instance may result from the attempt to define the methods of approach to the object sought whetherthrough a commission or through thedirect exchange of notes as initiatedTuesday There will be much discussion in all likelihood also regardingan armistice for it is the distinct purpose of the Spanish authorities to secure a suspension of hostilities pendingthe negotiations for peace It may bethat the application will be grantedbut if so it will be only under themost effective safeguards to preventloss of any advantage to the UnitedStates and upon binding pledges thatcertain well defined objects are to beconceded to usIt is virtually admitted hy leadingmembers of the administration thatupon only one point in peace negotiations is there likely to be serious friction and that relates to the future of thePhilippines As to Cuba and Porto Ricoour government feels that there is areasonable certainty of encounteringlittle opposition to our demandsThe Spanish government might insist upon the proposition thrown outby the Vatican Tuesday namely thatbhe United States shall xanhexGubathe ostensible purpose being to securefull protection for the Spanish elementleft in the island but while this wouldbe a vexatious point it would yield toadjustmentAs to the Philippines there is a fullexpectation of greater difficulties tobe surmounted There is reason tobelieve that these difficulties like theCuban settlement will be rather internal than international in theircharacter at least from the outsetThe president is firmly of the opinionthat the United States has no use forthe islands as a permanent possession The gravest problems ofgovernment would result werethe attempt to be madeto annex them owing to the heterogenuous and ill favored character ofthe large population of the islandswhile any effort to unite with otherpowers in a joint administrationmight be fairly expected to result asunsatisfactorily as the tripartite arrangement between the United Statestreat Britain and uermany for tnegovernment of the

Frog and His Various SuitsBy Dallas Love Sharp1iMSfniicommonest things should weTHEstop to study them would oftenprove very strange and interesting- Itis only because they are familiar thata e seldom think of extending- our acquaintance with the hope of discovering new and interesting characteristicsI need not ask our readers if thereib one of them who has never seen afrog You all have of course But didyou ever notice how he was dressedDressed Why you exclaim ifthere is one creature above anotherthat is not dressed it is the frog Atfirst sight this looks true enough forfrogs do seem to wear very little-clothing and indeed what need havethey for clothes They live continual3 along the water much of their timeis actually spent in it and so if theymust have clothing a bathing suitought at most to be sufficientBut frogs are really dressed in twosuits all the time and they wear out asauany as 15 -or 20 in a single summerAstonishing Yes and every suit ismade to order and is a perfect fitCatch five or six frogs Bub yourthumb over their backs till they arealmost dry Among the number yuwill find one or two from whose backsyou can peel off little films of clearcolorless skin If you continue youcan pull it off their legs like stockingsThis is the frogJs second best or everyday suit lie goes swimming in theseclothes They were made on purposefor bathing and gymnastics and heaises them altogether in his standingbroad jump and high diving contestsYou do not pain him in the least bytaking them off in this manner although they seem to be a -tight fitYou rather aid him in fact for itwould be impossible to start them offat all if they were not worn out andready to be cast aside Without yourassistance he would have to take themoff alone and it is no easy matter forn frog to undress kBeneath his first suit is anotherwhich he always keeps for best andinwhich he feels very much dressed tipHow proud and really swell a bigbullfrog feels when he first comes outin these brave clothes Did you eversee a gayer dress Look at his greencap his striped stockings his spottedvest aud his big expansive bosom MrProg in full dress He is up-to-date inthe very latest style except alas inthe length of his coat tails they arewoefully shortBut why does he need two suits Xotlo keep lii in warm surely No thefrogs have no winter clothing and thequestion of warmth never enters afrogs head when he is getting newclothes for though he feels the coldas every other creature does he resorts to other means of protection Assoon as the first chilly nights of auitumn come on he dives to the bottomof the pond and digs in the -mud a softwarm bed where he sleeps all winterwithout a fear of your waking him asyou skate or slide over the frozen surface It is not to keep the wearerwarm but for quite another purposetliat the gay suit was intended It isespecially made to protect him againstiiis many enemiesProgs you know have no sting nopoison fang no disagreeable odor withivhich to defend themselves the onlyway they can escape the hawkssnakes small bo3rs and the host ofother foes is by hiding from them andin doing this their gay dress aids themrmore than anything else couldIt is almost impossible to see a frogamong the grass and rushes of a pondeven while he is croaking I oncelooked at three small pond lily leavesfor nearly an hour to find a little-cricket frog who was all the timejpeeping awajr from one of them but3C die not see him until he dove off intowater He had been sitting uponJSWthe stem of the nearest leaf all thetime but his green and spotted backwas so like the color of the leaf that Icould not make him out until hemovedIt is so hard to see these little frogsthat most people believe that they arenot frogs at all who make this musicin the marshes uut some kind of atadpoleProgs and their relatives the toadsare never troubled about getting anew suit as to when or where but theydo however have to take care of theirold clothes and it is very curious howsome of their cast off garments aredisposed ofA few days ago I picked up a treetoad Hyla Versicolor stiff and nearlydead with cold I brought him to myroom and put him in a wide mouthedbottle to thaw out Toward eveninghe was quite alive and sat on the bottom of the bottle his toes turned inhis head cocked up looking very muchsurprised at the strange surroundingsHe made himself at home howeverso I fixed a cork to let in fresh air andleft him in his new abodeHe seems to enjoy living with me asmuch as he did in the hole of the oldapple tree in the garden He climbs upthe sides of the bottle hangs on thereand goes to sleep for a whole day at atime Instead of a web between thetoes as has the frog there is on eachtoe of the tree toad a little ball ordisc and it seems as easy for him tohold on the sides of the bottle- withthese as it is to sit on the bottom IfI turn him upside down he knows nothing about it till he wakes Then he deliberately turns round so that hishead is up shuts his eyes and gees tosleep againAt night he is wide awake and is nowlooking at me apparently listening tothe scratching of my pen but littledoes he dream that lam writing abouthimThe second night after his arrivalrav little toad sat very still He wasdoubled into a ball his eyes drawn inhis feet rolled up and 1 could hardlytell which end was his head After atime he began to kick and gasp as if ingreat pain I feared he was dying Hewould huddle all up in a bunch thensuddenly kick out and stand up withhis mouth wide open trying it seemedto swallow somethingI picked up the bottle and saw thaihe was really choking for there wassomething in his mouth that could notbe swallowed It was a kind of cordrunning out of each corner of hismouth over his front legs and thinning-out along the sides of his bodyWith the next swallow I saw the stringslip down his throat a little and as itdid so the skin along his sides began toroll up It was his old suit He wastaking it off for a new one and insteadof giving it to the poor he was tryingto economize by swallowing it Whata meal AVhat a way to undressWhat curious economyNaturalists for a long time have saidthat toads ate up their skins after thejhad shed them but I have never seenit recorded that a toad eats its skinwhile shedding it and actually usesthis means of pulling- it off Three90MMMam frogIX FULL DRESSgreat gulps more and the whole suitshoes stockings and all disappearedThat was some days ago Pour daysafter this curious performance he ateup another suit and I saw the wholeoperation He pulled it over his headand neck with his fore feet as if itwere a shirt then crammed it into hismouth kicked it off his back workedout his feet and legs then swallowedit off as before But it comes off prettyhard and how can he possibly swallow it and keep it swallowed while hekicksThe toads tongue unlike ours isfastened at the front end with thefree end forked and pointing backward It is so long that it can bepushed far down liis throat and getting the end of this strange fork fastened into the skin he readily forces itdown as far as it is necessary andholds it thereMy little toad has had nothing to eatbut his cast off clothes since I have hadhim How long these will last I cannottell but he now wears a new suit ofgray and black which doubtless willsoon serve him for another meal likethe lest of his queer clothes

Their Possession of RoostsFor many years naturalists likeAudubon and Wilson studied and wroteof this bird before it was known thatthere were robin roosts as well aspigeon roosts Only within the lastfew years was the fact brought outthat a bird more familiarly knownthan the passenger pigeon followed tfcismode of spending the night althoughit adopted spring instead of fall fnrmassing by hundreds in a high sheltered wood for a nights protectionfrom cold or because it is the periodbefore pairing time or for some otherreason at present beyond mans kenWith what stealth must this wellknown and much observed bird havefound its way in such numbers to thesame patch of timber night after nightin the early months of the year according to locality coming from alldirections so swiftly that a secretedobserver could not count keeping upa chatter that could be heard for along distance until the last bird somewhat belated perhaps found sheltesin the darkening grove when all became silent as thousands of wingswere folded to restAnother peculiar trait of the robinunnoted except by so keen an observerof bird waj s as Maurice Thompson isthat with all its friendly and confiding relations with the human familyduring the time of nesting and rearingits young in the fall of the year it becomes a wild bird betaking itselflargely to the woods and even the seeluded parts of the mountains at thisseason showing little disposition tobe on familiar terms writh man givinga note of alarm and flying high andswiftly when surprised at his approach At this time they range overextensive tracts of country but nearly always evince a tendency to seclusion The writer has seen them insmall flocks flying over a wide valley atsuch an elevation that only by thewell known sharp squeak rather thanby the eye could he surely determinethat they were robinsPven in its migratory habits thisbird is somewhat peculiar They seemto move southward in the fall withmore tardiness than most other birdsallowing the increasing severities ofhe cold season to push them off thewinters edge Or are these late goersthe birds inured to cold by a residencein states farther north which coming southward take the place ofothers that have gone earlier in theseason The question of identity always a difficult one almost precludesargument on this point LippincottsDIG DOWN DEEPPrairie Dogs Have Holes Tliat Uo totlxe Water Level WhereThey DrinkThe most interesting thing I haveseen in many a day said Mr HarveyGeer of Lamont Col at the Ebbitt afew nights ago was a prairie dog wellDid you ever see one It isnt oftenthat a chance occurs to explore thehomes and haunts of these expeditiouslittle inhabitants of the plains A fewmiles from my town a large force ofmen has been at work this summermaking a deep cut for a short railroadup into the mines A friend of mine isin charge of the job and I went out aweek ago to see him nd the work thathad been done The first thing that attracted my attention when I got therewas the fact that the cut was beingmade through an old alfalfa field andthe roots fringed the sides of the cutand hung down 15 or 18 feet Up atthe surface of the ground were thetubbed green plants and reachingdown deep into the earth were the fatbusinesslike roots getting their livingfar below where ordinary plants foragefor subsistenceBut the most remarkable thing wasthe prairie dog wells that had beendug into The cut went through a dogvillage and being a deep one somo40 feet it went below the town Therehas always been a discussion aboutwhere the prairie dog gets his drinkSome say he goes eternally dry anddoes not know what it is to have anelegant thirst on him Usually theirtowns are miles from any stream andin an arid country where there is nosurface water at any time sufficient forthe needs of an animal requiring drinkThe overland travelers back in the daysof pioneering used to find the dogtowns out on the prairie scores ofmiles from the streams There wasno dew the air was dry as a bone thebuffalo grass would be parched brownand there would be absolutely nothingto quench thirst I remember a discussion begun 30 years ago in the American Naturalist by Dr Sternberg nowsurgeon general on the subject nd heargued in favor of the well theoryBut there near Lemont is occular proofof the well theory The nest holes ofthe dogs were five or six feet deep butfour or five holes went straight downas deep as the excavation had beenmade and evidently on into thewateroarrying sand beneath These holesappeared to be used by the whole colony commonly

naturally lazy Infact most people are It is this inborndisposition to get through life with theleast possible effort that makes onewalk on the grass merely to save threeor four steps Incidentally this natural laziness upon the part of thehuman race is responsible for the factthat Ebenezer Peckham who lives outon Cedar avenue had been unable toget a good brand of sod upon the exposed corner of his neat little lotHalf a dozen extra stepare necessaryto take one around Mr Peckhams corner but five out of every six peoplewho have in the past had occasion toturn that way have felt it their duty tocut

atthe women who violated the sanctityof his corner but it all went fornaught They kept right on cuttingacross and wearing the path deeperand deeper day by dayAt last Ebenezer Peckham made avow It was

desires to usehis gig he sends word to the officer ofthe deck who in turn calls the boatswains mate on watch and saysCall away the gigThe boatswains mate blows a longshrill blast on his pipe and shoutsAway gigThis process is changed when thebugle is used Then the officer of theileck commands the bugler to call awaythe gig and that functionary playsthe Gig call The boatswains pipeis used when all hands are called tomoor or unmoor ship and when thework is completed the boatswainpipes down which means that heblows a pipe which permits those notactually at work to go below It is adismissal of all hands from the workfor which they weresumrnoned Whenhowever all hands are called to theirstations for a duty connected with thefighting business of the vessel thebugle is employed For instance

of the leg semicircularly across from one to the othei and onto the hoof The throat should neverbe cut crosswise and the horns andtail bones should always be removedThe operation of salting is equallyimportant To salt hides thoroughly awater bucket full of good salt shouldbe used to each 50 pound hide thequantity for larger and smaller hidesbeing in proportion After this theyshould be

attendantprivileges which no other place in theworld affords and itis right that itanould But it is not right that thisfreedom and those privileges should beabused to the disadvantage of the wifeToo many men seem to have the ideathat they can drop into constant disconsolate and churlish moods at homewith their wives which in any otheiplace and by any other person wouldnot be tolerated It is when a manis within the walls of his home thathe is himself Then it is that he shoildbe at his best When a man gives thebest that is within him to thoseclosest to him his home will be theideal place that he wishes it to beNo man has a right to expect from hiswife what he on his part does not giveher If he wants her sympathy hemust give her his consideration If aman lacks the element of consideration he should cultivate it and cultivate it not for the benefit of his friendsbut for those in and of his home Consideration should begin at home notin the homes of friends as it so oftendoes and ends there too The atmosphere which a man creates in his homeby example becomes the rule by whichhis children live The husband and father strikes the keynote for right orwrong living Edward W Bok inLadies

Conscience by William Maynadier Browne in ScribnersThe London Lancet Says It Is Not 1ous to SmokersReferring to the agitation started in jFrance hy a society hich acts on theprinciple that tobacco is always use-less often harmful and sometimes homicidal The Lancet says We agree inso far that we allow tobacco to be sometimes very harmful It is of course apoison but so is tea as also coffeetwo vegetable products which are consumed by nearly every inhabitant ofeither England or France All three canbe and very often are abused but thisdoes not do away with their reasonableuse In these days of rush and hurry tobacco has often a most soothing andrestful effect The tobacco sold inFrance is to put it mildly not goodand although in England it is possibleto buy fairly good toLacco it is nextdoor to impossible to get it pureThat is to say it is nearly alwaysscented or treated in some way so as togive it an artificial flavor Cigars arebeyond the purse of any but a rich manand as for cigarettes the filth sold assuch is beyond description A pure tobacco society would be an admirable institution and as for the traders sayingcustomers like scented tobacco the1 customer seldom gets the chance ofan ounce all f smoking anything else The truth isthat as in the case of highly scentedtea or soap it is cheaper to fake inferior qualities of stuff than to supply thereal thing To be unsophisticated anarticle must be of good quality but thecraze for cheapness is ruining everything and when people buy cigarettesat 36 cents a hundred it is not to bewondered at that they get well an inferior articleIn view of these dicta it is interestingto note that cigarettes are turned out inlarge quantities by firms of repute at aretail price nearly a third less than theprice mentioned by The Lancet London TimesRed Men So Love to DrinkI was down in the Indian Territorya few weeks ago said a St Louis manthe other day and business took me tothe capital of the Cherokee NationThere is no country in

this carmine fluid was a most popular beverage A good sized bottle of itcould be had for 50 cents and it waswarranted to make the drunk comeIt seemed to me that when the Indianswere willing to go to
