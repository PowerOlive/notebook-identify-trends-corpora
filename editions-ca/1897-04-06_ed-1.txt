the other dfryI lived in a highly respectable bluegrass toAvn with an old uncle and auntwho wiere seeing to the proper bringingup of their onlr and well belovednephew Among their possessionswere two horses and a negro boy whotook care of them and those horsesand that boy wre my especial delightAfter my first winter in town and whenthe weather began to soften in- thespring the boy and Twera -accustomedto ride the liorses to a pond to waterwhich was perhaps three quarters ofa mile from the stable half of whichdistance was through the town Itsoon became our custom when thehorses had finished drinking to leithem go full tilt for home and thespeed they attained was startling sofast in fact that we soon had to takethem to the alleys andxun them to thestable that way I suppose we hadbeen keeping this up for three monthsand Jjhe horses had got so that theywould scarcely wait to drink beforethey wanted to be off when one Sundaymy uncle and aunt concluded theywould go to meeting in the countrytny uncle wns a staid and severe deacon in the Presbyterian church andfor -a change they rode the horses instead of driving them As luck woulditvave it tfliey came back to town over aroad that led by the pond where Jimand I watered xo horses and as it wasabout watering time as they passedthey stopped to -let the horses drinkOf course uncle and aunt had perfectconfidence in their critters and werenot expecting any demonstrations butas soon as those horses had taken agood long pull at the water and liftedtheir heads to take a look around itseemed to occur to them all at oncethat it -was time to cut and run for thestableAnd they did My eye how thejdid Down the road for the -first quarter of a mile past the houses of threedeacons in opposite churches withtheir families sitting out on their galleries in the eool of the evening thenon past the ministers house they wentlike the wind my uncle doing- all hecould to hold the beasts and my auntfrightened out of her wits by the unexpectedness of it doing all she couldto hold herself oiu her horses backUncles hat flew off as he turned intothe first alley or rather as the horsesturned him into the alley and fourboys with three dogs got hold of it andcame howling after My aunts horsealways made bis spurt at this point andas her skirts flew at the mercy of thewind he gave a wild plunge anddashed ahead of mv uncle As theysped up the people on the streetswhere the alleys crossed hurried out ofthe way and gazed in awestruck wonderas the deacon and his good wife scurriedalong on clattering hoofs The usualSunday quiet had prevailed and thenoise of the racing- steeds seemed tofill all the town and people soon began to run out on the streets and inquire what was going on At last thehorses reached the stable and therewithout any trouble at all thevctopped and waited to be let in as usual I dont know what would havehappened to me when my part thoughwholly unintentional in the affair became known to my uncle had it notbeen for my aunt who had an eye to theludicrous and she got me off with onlyone application of the hickory whilethe negro boy got twice as much Myuncle was on unpleasant terms with mefor several months however becausehe was -jollied about his horse race fora long time and every fresh jar heAvould get on it Avould react upon meI may say in conclusion though thathay aunt did not stand by me when hesaid that Jim and I would suffer severepain and penalties if there were anyrnoire running of the horses Washington StarA MIND READERHJm Honor Ivnevr What His-Private-SecretaryTlioag htJob

STUDLEYA cool gray and sweet neatness within and a world of rampant glory withoutCordelia Brown had been brought upa Shakcress and this was her Californian home Everybodjr was thunderstruck when Joel Brown proposed toand was accepted by prim Sister Cordelia as she was willed by everyoneThough Sister Cordelia had years andyears ago f OEEaken the community lifestill the early training was much in evidence even to the quaint and spotlesskerchiefWhen the first froth of it had blownorT everyone agreed that after all itwas not an ill match Joel was steadySister Cordelia was the quintessence ofsteadiness Joel Brown was nearer-fifty than forty and assuredly SisterCordelia made no pretense to youthAgain their farms adjoined Therefore it was all as it should be -whenCordelia transferred her bits over toJoel Browns his residence being abouttwice the size turning her house into-a drying place- Joel himself had everbeen neat as wax but now the wholesurroundings shone with a purity thatwas immaculate Joel had a touch ofromance in him he stroked his silver vgray chin and saidWhat do you want most that I canbuyyou Something out of the ordinary you understandCordelia understood it was to bethe wedding present since before theynvere married she had persistently refused to accept any iiiemento whatsocver After much deliberation she repliedMister Brown I guess that as yevf eel ye must- be extravagant for once inyour life Ill take the finest sprinklertand fountain hose ye can findSo Joel bought a length of hose and anozzle that look her breathawa She had secretly sighed manyyears for half such a length and as shedirected the stream on the goldenfruit- until every orange shone like agolden ball in its setting of deep greenshe murmured My but 1 hope such alength of nozzle is not sinfulHowever Cordelia was Cordelia stilltmd two things she would not countenance viz the twirling whirling fountain attachment to the wonderful hose-and the other Joels coltJoel magnanimously changed thenfirst to a steady triumphant matter-of-factspray which played nightly on thetiny lawn that was a part of the trimglory of the place but the colt ahthere was the rub It was Joels weakness his one weakness he doted on abit of good horseflesh and this colt-was a colt of pedigree It had a famousracing sire Had it been branded on itssilken coat with the word Sin it couldnot have been more an object of silent-condemnation to Cordelia To her itwas the carnal representative of theipomps and vanities of ihis wickedworld Joel was not unmindful of itbut the colt was the coltTractable and gentle as a kit ten led byxt little halter it would run by the side ofJoel as he drove to market It evensought with soft whinny to woo Cordelia as she passed the paddock in herclean gray dress and white cap butCordelia never turned her head Joelsmiled softly to himself yet respectedCordelias notions all the sameThe colt grew apace The neighborsjnen and women also respected Cordelias notions insomuch that the very-few nien friends of Joel would wait until she had passed on to meeting beforethey strolled over to Joels to hev alook at that coltIt was whilst Cordelia was away that-the colt was first broke into harnessLittle breaking was required for bymethods Enid for such wasthe colts name seemed to understandit was a proud promotion and behavedaccordinglyWhen the evening came on after thetdays work was over Cordelia like apicture of placid rectitude sat on theporch the spray sprinkling the grassinnd then would Joel harness the littlecot and drive away for an hour returning to devote himself to Gcrdelia andhis reading By his suppressedlance Cordelia knew the horse was acting magnificently and realizing allJoels dreams oi a colt with such agreeLands sake Mis Brown said MissrField a neighbor
