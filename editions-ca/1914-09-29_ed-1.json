large per cent, of the winners being
either by him or by his sons. He was
pie eire of the four great aged horses,

THE WAR TAX.

THEATRICAL.
NOTICE.
The war tax, as agreed on by the
Democratic House caucus, approved
by the President and Mr. Underwood
and, in the material form in which it
will bev enacted, adds to the special
stamp taxes imposed during the
Spanish-American war tax on beer,
wine. and gasoline.
Aside from Republican opposition,
which sees in the imposition of any
tax the first opportunity for thermanu
facture of political capital which has
presented itself in long months of
weary waiting, the country is disposed
to look on the situation with a measure
of philosophy.
It is a debated question as to the
effect of a Democratic tariff in the
decrease in revenue. It is an incon
testable fact that the war, which 'is
the protectionist theory under most
favorable conditions, has reduced rev
enues i nsuch fashion and extent as
this country has never before known.
The war is a condition. The best the
Republicans can make out of the tariff
for their present purposes is a theory.
The debt is here and has to be paid,
though the great majority of Ameri
agree with Mr. Wilson that we did not
incur it.
Happily the provisions of the war
tax measure are likely to prove an
noying rather than burdensome. Red
tape will have to be submitted to and
inconsiderable expenditures made hy
