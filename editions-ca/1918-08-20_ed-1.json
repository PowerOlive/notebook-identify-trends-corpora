RED CROSS APPEALS FOR
-. TRENCH FOOT SLIPPERS
To the Women of Bourbon County :-
In our quota for September 1, in
Red Cross work, is a request for 500'
trench foot slippers (250 pairs.)
These slippers should be made of
velvet, velveteene, corduroy or heavy
cloth. They are then lined with out
ing flannel.'
It is irpossible for us to buy "the
necessary material and we are asking
the patriotic women of the county
to send us any garments or pieces
they have no use for, to be used in
this way. An old pair of cloth
trousersy of a coat, can be- cut into
several parts, as the slippers can 'be
pieced.
We published an appeal some days
ago, but the response was so small
we have less than 50 slippers madev
Are we to fail in this, as we have
done' in nothing else? We have been
proud of our Tecord up to this time.
May it always remain untarnished.
If any friend desires to buy a
remnant or piece of newmaterial to
send in, it requires two-thirds of a
yard of 27 incH goods to make one
pair.
Send all material to the Red Cross
rooms, at the Court House, in Paris.
If it is more convenient for. ladies
out in the country, materials maybe
sent to Mrs. Annabelle Wallace, or
Mrs. D. C. Lisle, at Leesburg; Miss
Florence Hopkins, at Little Rock;
Mrs. Letcher Weathers, at Clinton-ville,-
