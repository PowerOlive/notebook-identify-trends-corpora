Therewhen the plan was not in effect themarkets went to pieces at the opening. The prices received averagedonly ten cents for the better qulHyas against twenty-five cents for thesame quality at the sales last year.Some ..crops that averaged, twenty-livts iu iwuiiLy-sevtiii ueuis iat,v eaionly brought about seven cents thisyear.Do the tobacco growers and farmers of Bourbon county want to seethis condition obtain here this yearat the opening of the markets? Don'tthey remember the slump of lastyear? Then they ought to be inhearty accord with the Co-operativeBurley Tobacco Marketing Association's plan, and everyone of themought to sign the contract, if onlyfor their own protection.oFOR MAYOR.JOHN MERRINGERA VOTE FOR HIM WILL MEANA VOTE FOR YOUR INTERESTSAND THE CITY'S INTEREST.NOTICE TO TAXPAYERS LISTYOUR PROPERTY NOWWE ARE NOW READY TO TAXEYOUR TAZ LIST AT OUT OFFICEIN THE COURT HOUSE.

ED. BEDFORD FORSHERIFF.NEWSPAPER ADVERTISING PAYSNo more convincing illustration ofthe effiiciency of newspaper advertising has been presented than the experience of the Literary Digest. Fiveyears ago when the magazine had350,000 circulation the directors decided that a larger circulation wasdesirable and that the only way toget it was through advertising. Forfour years $1,000,000 was investedannually in 400 leading newspapersin the United States with the resultthat to-day the magazine has a circulation of 1,300,000, and its incomehas been increased more than 360per cent.Would it have been possible for theLiterary Digest to secure such returns from any other medium? Webelieve not. Newspaper advertisingpresents its messages when peopleare in a receptive mood. Appearingas it does in a medium that it welcomed and read in practically every?household it is bound to attract theattention of the mass of the people,and if the article advertised possessesreal merit, large sales are sure to follow.

Martin, 1710Owen Street, Louisville, Ky., foremanof the Arctic Ice Co., and CouncilCommander of Blue Grass Lodge No.95, W. O. W.:"My first experience with this medicine was 5 years ago when it restoredme to health, and ever since that timeI have had a bottle in the house andon different occasions my wife andfour children have taken it. I don'tbelieve there is a healthier familyin Louisville than mine and I giveTanlac the credit for keeping us insuch fine shape. When I began taking it I was in a badly run-down condition. My food seemed to do melittle or no good, my sleep was neversound and I was growing weakerand thinner every day."A friend persuaded me to tryTanlac and it did everything he saidit would do. It just put me in thepink of condition, and ever since thenwhen I feel a little out of sorts I takealdose of Tanlac and get right again.What I have spent for Tanlac hasbeen too small to mention and thegood my family have receivedfrom it has been worth more thanmoney can buy. Ir people knew asmuch about it as I do every familywould have it in the home."SIGNS FOR LAUGHTER"(Topics of The Day Films)Sign writers are alert individualswho ply their trade or shall we sayart, in routine manner usually withthe desired results.

The first isfresh burned lime or ordinary limestone. It requires .56 pounds of theburned lime or 74 pounds of thehydrated or "water-slacked lime, andthe third carbonated lime or ordinarylimestone. It requires 56 pounds ofthe burned lime or 74 pounds of theTiydifted lime to do as much, good asthe 100 pounds of the limestone, according to tKe specialists. Where itis necessary to haul long distance itmay pay to use the burned Ume. If1,120 pounds of this form can be de-hnely ground limestone, then itshould be used.There is no difference in the effectiveness of the three forms, accordingto the specialists. Fresh lime shouldnot be applied to green plants andfurthermore is unpleasant to handle.It costs more a ton than the groundlimestone which is uhualyy to bepreferred. A farmer who has limestone on his own farm can usuallyget it crushed for approximately$1.00 a ton. This makes it an economical form to use.Ashes sometimes may be obtainedfor the hauling and since they areone-third to one-half lime and contain a small amount of phosphorusand considerable potash, they arewbrth hauling as substitute for limestone. Enough wood ashes may beused to sweeten the soil withoutdanger.In general the kind of lime to 'useis that which is easiest to obtain andmost economical. Ordinarily this willbe the finely-ground limestone. Thepure limestone can be Used anywhere,in any amount, and at any time without danger to ordinary farm crops.oHall's Catarrh MedicineThogewho are in a "run down" condl-wfll aotice that Catarrh bothrawem much more than when they are Inpod health.

The acreage was idivided among 32 farms in 13counties and is expected to producefrom 8,000 to 10,000 bushels of grainwhich will be available for seed thisfall.The new strain of wheat which hasbeen the highest yielder at the Experiment Station farm for- the last sixyears was, developed from one headout of about 500 heads selected in1313. In 1915 enough wheat was secured to plant three one-tenth-acreplots and the strain gredually developed from that time. The first distribution of seed from the station wasmade in the fall of 1910 when 50bushels were sent out. In the fall of1920, 300 bushels were distributed,which resulted in the crop for thisyear.The Ashland is similar to allstrains of Fultz in appearance. However, the straw of Ashland is somewhat stiffer than that of Fultz andslightly lighter in color. It has proved to be a consistent yielder in Central Kentucky and gives excellent results wherever Fultz wheat has been,popular.During the years from 1915 to 1920inclusive the average yield an acre bfAshland at the Experiment Stationhas exceeded those of the three leading varieties ol wheat in the State,including Jersey Fultz, Fulcaster andGurrell's Prolific.
