made as the authorities had drifted far away from the original intention of the authors of the civil servicelaw Mr Allen Neb charged thatthe law was openly and daily violated andsaid it was a hiss and byword among the people Mr Cockrell Mo declared that it waspresumptuous in Secretary Sherman to makerecommendations to congress that certain positions in his department should be exceptedfrom the classified service when the presidenthad full authority to make the exceptions herecommended He thought an effort was beingmade to tie the presidents hands Mr Davischairman of the committee on foreign relations gave notice that he would next Mondayand daily thereafter move that the senate consider in executive session the Hawaiian annexation treaty until it was disposed of finallyHouse The civil service debate began inthe house Wednesday based on the item in thelegislative executive and judicial appropriation bill for the maintenance of the commission It promises to continue at least until theend of this week with a possibility that it mayrun longer But it is generally admitted onboth sides that the appropriation in the billwill stand as the anti civil service reformers do not seriously contemplate anattempt to strike it out The debatetherefore is only preliminary to any programme which the enemies of the lawmay agree upon The members of the houseare divided into three camps on this questionthose who stand by the law those who advocate its entire repeal and those who desire itsmodification These divisions were apparentin the debate Wednesday the nature of whichwas not as stirring

throughout the state notwithstandingthe passage of legislation especially intendedtoprevent their operationsIn Hancock county in open day and withoutmasks or evei pretense of secrecy a Negrowas forcibly taken from the jail and hung onthe public streets of Hawesville Rewards-were promptly offered but the coroners jurydoubtless composed of blind men before whomnone but blind witnesses testified returned averdict that deceased had lost his life at thehands of persons unknown to them Therecan be no excuse or palliation for the conductof the brute who was swung into eternity butnevertheless the mob in hanging him wereguilty of murderSuch swift punishment is not attended by theanguish and suffering endured by the condemned criminal and docs not inspire thedread or terror of a legal execution Doubtless had the guilty wretch been given hischoice of punishment he would have selectedthat meted out to him So that in his illegalexecution the law was robbed of its victimue punishment inflicted less severe than itould otherwise have been and the law violated and trampled under footAs said in my inaugural mob violencewhjse home is in the breast of cowardsshould be prevented at all hazard or if committed promptly and severely punished It isan open declaration of contempt for the lawsthe courts and the administration of justiceand instead of promoting destroys the welfare of the state The commission of crime topunish crime can find no apologist in ChristiancivilizationIn this connection allow me to call your attention to the insufficiency of the law concerning an attempt at assault In such cassiwhere the person assaulted receives injury thek for not less tffivn ten yearsjury as the extent of injury may demandYour attention is especially directed to thefrequent occurrence of what is called turnpike raids Persons engaged in this characterof crime have become more emboldened whilelaw abiding citizens seem to have becomeparalyzed The Martin law although well intended has failed to accomplish its purpose Ihave faithfully tried to enforce it by offeringrewards and employing detectives but do notknow of a single conviotion under its pro--visionsOn the contrary in many localitiespublic sentiment is reported as indorsing thecrime In nearly every instance wnere thesecrimes have been committed the vicious areloud mouthed in approval while peaceable citizens more or less are overawed andafraid to speak This appears strange ina state which boasts of the prowess ofher sons Nevertheless it is true Be itsaid however to the credit of Kentuckythat the citizens of the greater portionof the state condemn such high handed outrages I am satisfied in numerous instancesmany of those who pose as good citizens havewinked at outlawry because the result wouldbe the depreciation in value of turnpikes andthus enable the counties to purchase them atnominal prices thereby preventing in a largedegree the levying of taxes Advantage hasleen taken by some of the fiscal courts of thiscondition of affairs and counties have becomebeneficiaries of crime which would not havebeen committed but for the worthlessness andcowardice of officials and the corruption ofcitizens who openly countenanced the lawbreakers Frequently counties have voted forfree turnpikes by large majorities and at thesame time voted against the issuance of bondsto pay for them In other words they declarethey will have free roads without making compensationUnder such circumstances as might be expected turnpike stock owned by the statewhich was valued at 400000 three years agoand which produced nearly 24030 dividendsannually is comparatively worthlessIn many places turnpike officials fear to askfor guards lest their houses should be burnedor they should be assassinated In one casethe state inspector was sent to the scene oftrouble to make the application for guardsbut on his arrival was notified by the formergatekeepers that they would not collect toll because of fear that the guards would not protect them or that the guards would be soonwithdrawn when they would be killed It isvery clear in many places that peace officersare in sympathy - with the mob inothers that they prefer that the outrages should continue and the turnpikes be bought for a song rather than thecounty should be taxed to p ly for guards andin others that guards can not be found whohave the courage or desire to do their dutyAgain the friends and relations of the raidersand in some instances the raiders themselveshave been appointed as guards and promptlysurrendered to the outlaws Arbitrary pricesmerely nominal have been placed upon someof the roads and the owners notified that theymust accept them or be forced to cease the collection of toll But in all localities the counties have seen that pikes were assessed atgood values and taxes promptly collected Inone instance the raiders carried their workto its proper conclusion by robbing the gatekeepers of the tollsThis evil so long continued is seeking otherfields of operation It naturally occurs to theraiders that if tollgates can be taken with impunity all other property can be taken in like- - manner And so it is these- knights of thoroad have undertaken to regulate the quantityof tobacco thefarmer should cultivate destroying his plants if he dared to disobey have notified the miller that he should charge no morefor flour than the price fixed by them threatened with the shotgun and the torch farmerswho bad posted their lands if the boards werenot taken down and they allowed to hunt without hindrance and notwithstanding all thishigh handed conduct not one of the ruffianshas been punishedCandidates for office have been known toopenly champion these criminals in orderto be and have thereby been electee whilethose who have stood for good governdown to dement have almost universally gonell this spirit is not stamped out the day isfVBpvnot far distant when the atate will be com-pletely under the control or swash bucklersand highway robbers who will rob steal andmurder at will iThe stock in turnpikes owned bv the stateis bought from taxes assessed upon the wholepeople and was thereafter set apart as a portion of the sinking fund and under the provisions of the constitution can not be diminished by act of the legislature until the debt ofthe commonwealth is paid Thousands ofpublic spirited citizens and in many Instancesthe widow and the guardian of orphans haveuave juvesiBu in tnese stocics reiymg on tnelaws of the state and their enforcemet for protectionGranting for arguments sake that freeroads are desirable it by no means followstnat tneir owners should be robbed and plunderedYou are now boldly confronted with the question whether these crimes are to continue orwhether the state has the will and the powerto protect the lives and property of its citizensIn January 1896 1 recommended in a generalmessage and again at the called session thepassage of a law making the counties where mobviolence prevailed responsible in damages tothe widows children or heirs of persons killedand responsible to those Injured in person orproperty This law has proven salutary inevery state of the union where it has been enacted With it should be connected the absolute right of change of venue so that trialsmay be had by unprejudiced juries in unprejudiced communities I have been informed that among other contentions whichprevented the adoption of such a statute it wasasserted that corporations would burn theirproperty or prevent the collection of tolls inorder to sue the counties and that personswould have their relatives killed in order torecover damages from the county These objections are puerileNo one more deeply deplores the present condition of uflairs than myself and to no one isit more painful to make such a confession butwhen human life is cheap when millions ofdollars that would otherwise seek investmentin Kentucky are being turned into other channels when we are becoming a spectacle in theeyes of the people of other states and othercountries not only love for my native statebut official duty demands plain speech andprompt and severe actionIt is idle to talk economy in the public service as long as extravagance is suffered to continue It is better to curtail expenses than toincrease taxes Hitherto the attention of yourpredecessors has been called to this matterwithout success I hope however that different action will be had by youUseless offices should be abolished The bureau of agriculture has been fully tested and ifcommon experience and general opinion areworth anything has fallen far short of accomplishing any material good Yet thousands ofdollars are expended annually to carry out itspurposes This can be abolished only by constitutional amendment whiKh I recommendmay be doneRegister of the land office entails an expenseof thousands of dollars each year without corresponding benefitThe present salaries are in nearly every instance twice as much as they were at the conclusion of the war when the premium on goldwas greater than ever before There is no reason why such a condition of affairs shouldexistPerhaps the most exclusive drain on thetreasury is criminal expenditures In thisare comprised jury fees witness fees sheriffsmarshals jailers and constables fees costs ofexamining courts etcUnder the present laws a large number ofpersons are yearly sent to the penltentiarj whoshould be fined and compelled to work out thesame on the county roadsShortly after the present administration cameinto power the contract with the FrankfortChair Co was forfeited by the directors of thepenitentiary on account of the companysfailure and refusal to pay its indebtednessto the state and the Inability by reason ofthat fact of the directors to continue operations The large amount of floating debt thenowing and which could not be paid for lack offunds in the treasury rendered it imperativein carrying on work in the penitentiary to collect from the company all money due Therewas no other source from which the fundsneedful to pay operating expenses- could behad In this condition of affairs the companydemanded that the directors should not appoint a superintendent they had selectedThis demand was disregarded whereupon thecompany purchased at a discount a sufficientamount of warrants owing by the state tocover its indebtedness and offered the same tothe auditor in payment refusing to pay a single dollar in money By their own action theyterminated the contractIt then became necessary to advertise forbids for convict labor which was done promptly resulting in what is known as the Martincontract for the employment of 650 men Considerable complications have grown out of thiscontract and in order that the real merits ofthe transaction might be understood I orderedState Inspector Lester to make a careful examination of the working of the same and forthat purpose ordered him to employ an expertaccountant His report will be placed beforeyou and will doubtless have your close studyand attentionThe contract has not realized the moneywhich it was thought it would at the time itwas made and there is now a controversy between the state and Mr Martin in which theformer claims that the latter owes the additional sum of 23000Following closely upon the termination ofthe contract with the Frankfort Chair Cocame the destruction of the workshops at Eddyville by fire This threw outof employment a large numberof convicts and the Mason Ford Co declinedto engage further in business at that penitentiary except to work up a small quantity of material on hand but agreed to and did hire 400convicts at 35 cents each per day to be employed in the manufacture of shoes and broomsat the Frankfort penitentiary provided thatthe portion of the shops destroyed by fire priorto December 1895 should be rebuilt and an additional building erectedUnder great difficulties the shops were constructed and in addition to this an expenditure of nearly 10000 made in equipping theFrankfort penitentiary with machinery Thepenitentiary is now better equipped with machinery and better prepared to make convictlabor profitable than at any time in the pastI suggest that an appropriation be made topay for the workshop at Eddy ville aud thussave the payment of interest by the stateYour attention is called to the danger of firein these institutionsThe directors of the penitentiary at Frankfort are now paying for water the enormoussum of 5000 per yearI suggest that you investigate these mattersthrough committees and take such action asyou believe the interests of the state demandOur charitable institutions are in a mostthriving condition The total expenses for the1 asylums for six months of 1895 andsponding months of 1896 are 1895 103837931896 17522098 showing a decrease of 2361695i and an average decrease in per capita of 1135j I again urge upon your honorable body suchj legislation as will carry into effect the presentstatute concerning houses of reform It isommended that you so amend the statute as toprovide specifically for the issue ot a warr ntin order that this great work may be speedilycompletedI urge upon your honorabe body to take thenecessary steps immediately looking to theerection of new and suitable state buildingsi The common school system is the nursery ofi liberty and everything should be done that Iscalculated to improve and enlarge it Muchprogress has been made in this direction butv ere is room for greater advancementIt is claimed that Kentucky pays twice asmuch for school books as states north of usIf this be true such laws should be enacted aswill remedy it If uniformity in teit booksshould be required the prices wouldJy be reducedI And among other matters your attention iscalled to better school facilities for thegroes The old common school law whichleved a tax upon blacks and whites to be usedseparately for each r ce was held unconstitutional and after a vote by the people the fundwjvs divided equally per capitaIs the colored people are genenilly poor andui able tc pay large costs of transportation itIs suggested that another normal school shouldi established in western Kentuckykii - zegxtsxsrrrsiHjaiguyiThe corruption of the electi ve franchise andthe defeat of the will of the majority shouldnot be tolerated for a moment Appreciatingthe full force of this sentiment the makers ofour present constitution defining who shouldvote provided that -the first general assemblyheld after the adoption of this constitutionshall pass all necessary laws to enforce thisprovision and shall provide that persons illiterate blind or in any way disabled mayhave their ballots m irked as herein requiredIn conformity to the foregoing section and inorder that every man may be able to cast hisvote I again recommend that a circle or squareshould be placed below each party device inwhich the voter may make his mark Manymistakes are made under the present regulation as many in one political party as in theother and in this way persons deprived oftheir votes Every facility should be affordedthe humblest man in the commonwealth to intelligently cast his vote and have it countedMutations Sa politics in the end bring retribution to any party that denies or abridges therights of citizenshipWhere registration is necessary especiallyin large cities it is charged that regularlyregistered voters in some instancesare falsely impersonated and on thisaccount persons who are not entitled vote and in this way prevent legalvoters from exercising their privileges As towhether this charge be true I do not know butthe fact that such a thing might be done is sufficient to call for the enactment of such laws aswill in some measure identify the lawful voterPrimary elections should be prohibited frombeing held at the tame time or place whereregular elections are held They consumetime and create confusion and undue excitement The selection of candidates should notbe allowed in any way to conflict with or affectthe election of officersThere is a diversity of opinion as to whethercanvassing or examining boards have the rightto pass on rejected ballots This should bemade plain and the right of every citizen guaranteed to have his vote counted as castwhether there is or is not a contest The lawshould be made so explicit that no citizen shalllose his vote on account of the technical failure of any officer to discharge a plainly ministerial duty when the officers of the election aresatisfied that the ballot was in fact depositedAccording to the present law when anyparty has failed to nominate a candidate byconvention or primary election upon a petitionsigned by the requisite statutory number anyindividual however objectionable may havehis name placed under a party device Frequently this may prove distasteful to the partyand should not be allowedSection 1458 Kentucky Statutes prohibitsthe secretary of state from certifying and thecounty clerk from placing the name of a candidateproperly certified to have been nominatedon the ballot whenever notified by such candidate that he will not accept the nominationSection 1464 Kentucky statutes providesthat in case of death removal or resignation after the printing of the ballotcertain steps may be taken to meet thecontingency I suggest that in eitherstate of case referred to in the last named section or in the case mentioned in Section 1458it be made the duty of the secretary of state orclerk to at once give notice to the chairman orsecretary of the state central committee district or county committee and that pastersmay be provided and used in such case andproper steps taken by the party organizationsuch as will enable such party to supply theplace as provided in Section 1461Section 1557 Kentucky statutes prescribes afine of 50 and impris onment in the county jailagainst any officer upon whom a duty is imposed in Chapter 41 who shall wilfully neglectto perform his public duty or who shall wilfully perform it in such a way as to hinder theobject of the law a glance at the many important duties which this section governswill demonstrate that the punishment isentirely inadequate as to officers of registration anu officers of regular and primary elections Particularly is this trueas to the duties assigned to the secretary ofstate in certifying nominees the clerk in theproper preparation or distribution of stencilsand ballots the sheriff In delivering ballotboxes the county judge in the appointment ofofficers of election and giving the notice ofsame the admission of unauthorized personsinto the booth or within less than 50 feet of thepolls the counting of votes and the preservation of contested ballotsSection 1448 Kentucky statutes limits thoappointment of officers of election to housekeepers Many competent persons are excluded by this section and it should be alteredProud of the glorious achievements of thewhite race believing that it is the superior ofevery other that by reason of its advantagesin liberty education and advanced civilizationit can ill afford to place additional burdens upon others that are struggling for improvedmanhood and not fearing for a moment thatany race will become its equal I most earnestlyrecommend the repeal of what is known as theseparate coach lawThe use of intoxicating liquors and the carrying of concealed weapons are the fruitfulsource of nearly every murder that is committed Local option and prohibition laws are being evaded and rendered inoperative by reason of the jug trade Attempts have beenmade to punish those who deliver whisky inthe counties where such laws are in forcebut the court of appeals has decided thatthe place of delivery is that where the jugsare handed to the expressman or common carrier and in this way an avenue of escape hasbeen afforded and the platforms of depots inanti whisky localities are daily covered withjugs In order to remedy the evil it is suggested that a law be enacted fixing the legal delivery of intoxicating liquors at the place of destin tion instead of the jalace or shipment except as to original packages from points outside Kentucky and providing proper punishment for any person natural or artificial whodelivers the article at the place or destinationAgain attention is called to the sale of cigarettes and cigarette paper Their use is universally condemned by the medical profession andevery day experience I recommend that theirsale be prohibitedEvery year the docket of court of appeals i3enlarged One cause for it is that appeals areallowed where the amount in controversy exclusive of interest and cost is 100 There is noreason why this rule should be continuedHeretof re the thanks of the state have beentendered to the proper authorities for the exacted compliment of giving the name of ourstate to one of the most magnificent battleships that the inventive genius ol this greatcountry has ever conceivedThe honorable secretary of the navy hasgiven notice that it will be launched during thelatter part of January next I trust that yourhonorable body will take such action concerning this matter as your patriotism and statepride may suggest and that the occasion maybe made memorable and an inspiration to therising and future generations of our commonwealthIn conclusion allow me to indulge the hopethat during your session we may hearthy ooperate for the purpose of advancing the material interests of the state and that more

Thestate board of agriculture which isholding its annual session in this cityhas before it a proposition that thoproperty it owns be turned over to thestate and that it become a state organization Several 3rears ago the supremecourt held that the body was a privatecorporationGov Mount delivered an address before the board He saidA few evenings ago I heard a discussion among distinguished gentlemen of this city It was the consensusof opinion that the most discouragingoutlook for agriculture was found inthe fact that too many young men wereleaving the farm Statistics and observation strongly tend to show thatthe urban population is rapidly increasing while that of the rural districtSiis increasingat a far less rate Thecasual observer might conclude thatthis is to the advantage of the farmeras the tendency is to the decreasing ofproducers and increasing of consumersThe careful student of economics however wants to understand the reasonwhy there seems to be so little attraction in country lifeFarmers as a rule are inclined totalk farming down instead of exaltingits possibilities One of the gentlemenabove referred to said that some aggressive efforts are needed to attractattention and add interest to farmlifeThe superintendent of public instruction informs me that the total amountannually expended in the cause of education in Indiana would not fall shortof 10000000 I am in favor of thebroadest kind of education but I wantfarmers educated in the science of agriculture asAvell There is practicallyno instruction as to how crops growthe elements of plant

vaccinating i ounds he met the young womanwho demurred to being- vaccinated becausij she said she was going to get married The old gentleman says the doctor dissuaded her from getting married saying- that it would be better forher to get vaccinated than marriedThe girl finally consented to be vaccinated and when the aged lover returned to his promised bride he founda cool reception She flatly refused tomarry him giving as a reason that thedoctor had advised her that vaccinationwas better than marriage All he couldsay availed nothing She was obdurateand declined to marryI am the sufferer

mysalad days and a novice in the art ofdialogueI suppose said Gerard carelesslythat you have fallen in love withNancyThe question took me so completelyby surprise that my stupid face flushedscarlet I began to realize that thisman whose bodily presence was so contemptible was conversationally speaking dandling me in his armsI dont blame 3rou continued Gerard in his most matter-of-fact tonesShe is a pretty girl and very intelligent It would interest me to knoww h et he r e r sh eXo she doesntThank you I like to be posted Xono dont frown I dare swear thatshe will say yes and you may live towish it

upon the top wave ofsuccess Now that he had brought hisheavily freighted vessel into safe harborage he had leisure to read the logand estimate the wTear and tear Iwatched him as he leaned back wearilyagainst the well padded cushions ofthe buggy and made a small calculation Divide wealth as many millionsas 3 ou please by health subtract timeand what is left Answer the man beside me haggard

examination and with it his remarkable love for his son Mrs Gerardit appeared had been kind enough togive me more credit than I deservedand her husband expressed his appreciation of my efforts in a characteristicfashionYou are not giving me value received he said brusquely but youvedone all I asked and moreI wondered whether Mrs Gerard inher letters had mentioned my excursion into Cupids domain and answeredthe question in the negativeIm a generous man Gerard continued with that curious inflection inhis voice which I had remarked when hehad pressed upon me his rarest winesand my stepdaughter

These questions were adequately answered laterOur talk for the present was over Thelights of the house were in sight Thefamiliar roar of the surf became louderand louder and the dogs a brace

stickergrass on his coatI bade Mr Byers good night andwalked thoughtfully to the house Mydeductions in regard to this affair differed materially from those of honestJap I could not believe that Demetrius had willfully set rolling- theshock of hay If he had concealed himself in the barn for some specific purpose would he court detection for thesake of playing a prank or to gratifya personal spite Hardly The haybadly piled and undermined had ooeyedthe laws of gravitation Possibly in theardor of eavesdropping- the Greek haddisplaced the shock unwittingly Hehad studied the habits of Jap and hisbest girl and wishing to learn theexact condition of affairs in the househad turned his knowledge of sociologyto good account Very slimy as Jap observed An Anglo Saxon blessed withthe Greeks upbringing would havescouted such methods but the secretivgnature of Demetrius stimulated by terror of Burlington accounted satisfactorily for everything The fellow wasan out-and-out poltroonMark Gerard dined alone with Nancyand me He was in no mood to talkand g ulped down his dinner in gloomysilence Since we parted in the stableyard his manner had entirely changedFrom his gestures rather than from hiswords I inferred that he was intenselynervous I laid this to the charge of Demetrius and unduly irritable Nancytoo seemed depressed and abstractedShe replied in monosyllables to my fewquestionsNancy go to your mother said Gerard as the coffee was brought in Iwish to talk with Mr LivingstonWe imshed our chairs from the tableand lighted cigarsDemetrius said Gerard is not acoward1 merely bowed having resolved forthe future to curb my tongueHe proposes Gerard spoke slowlywatching me narrowly between halfclosed eyes he proposes to take entire charge of of this madman YouHe rolled

expresses the condition of ny feelingsHad Demetrius dared to make this suggestion in the teeth of what had occurred in the cave And if so in thename of the Sphinx to what purposeknowing as he must know that Ishould refuse to become a party to hisinfamous scheme Was master in collusion with man Xo I couldnt believe that What then The scoundrelwas a consummate judge of characterand he had had abundant opportunityto study the idiosyncrasies of HugoLivingston He probably counted uponmy promise of secrecy and by Jupiter the truth flashed upon me countedfurther upon my opposition and mysubsequent dismissal from the serviceof Gerard I would try and balk himIf Demet rius said I lightly isin the house I should like to talk thisover with himDemetrius returned at once toMarkHow far is it to the island I askedNot more than two milesI rose to my feetMr Gerard I must see Demetrius tonight Within two hours you shall haveyour answerHe nodded and puffed at his cigarAs you please he said indifferentlyThe immortal Lincoln said that youcould fool a part of the people all thetime and all the people part of thetime but that no man could fool allthe people all the timeIn considering the relations whichexisted between Mark Gerard and theGreek this piece of wisdom bubbled upout of my memory and lent an agreeable effervescence to my reflectionsGerard was a brilliant man in his waybut I had come to the conclusion thatDemetrius was the stronger mentallyof the two and exercised a potent influence upon his master I still clungto my theory in regard to the Greekscowardice otherwise I

a demonstration of unpopularitybut they failed signally and a raggedboy was arrested carrying about forgratuitous distribution a circular gotup by the Poles wherein the assassination of the emperor before he escapedfrom England was distinctly threatened and recommendedThe police commissioners showedone to me and every possible precaution was of course adopted by sprinkling a number of constables in plainclothes among the masses on thecourse but I confess that I felt somewhat uneasy know ing how easy it isfor any enthusiast or desperado whois content to sacrifice his own life totake that of anotherAbout this time there was also an attempt b3 a mad or hot brained Pole toenter the emperors room This object he purposed to effect b3r impersonating a tailor from whom a pair oftrousers had been ordered for his imperial majest3 ne offered Snip a largesum of mone3 if he would allow him todeliver these in his stead and the lattersuspecting something wrong handedhim over to the police who

COWSHow to Secure Satisfactory Resultsin Karan DairyingFrom an article written by GeorgeSampson of the Sharon Wis Beportsr we take the followingThe functions of the cow are -to takejrour coarse fodder and grain and manufacture them into milk Providingshe is so fed that she can sustain herbody and in addition produce milk at aprofit she is a good cow You knowthere are any number of cows that donot pay for their keeping but in thisage of progress we can ascertain beyond a shadow of doubt whether or note cow is a profitable dairv cowThere are three things you must consider 1 the quantity of milk given 2the quality by the Babcock test 3 thelength of the period of lactationAfter having succeeded in establishing a herd of good dairy cows comesthe important part of taking propercare of them Milch cows must have avariety -of feed as no one kind of feedcontains all the different- elementswhich both sustain the body and produce the milk We will see later whatmilk is composed of and you will understand why -she must have a varietyof feedDo not feed your cows before milking So many do this in order that thecow shall stand better during- the process of milking You will ask whyMost of the milk is secreted during theprocess of milking and the cow mustuse her blood in the udder If she iseating this blood rushes to her stomachan order to -carry the nutriment to thedifferent parts of the body and the consequence is that there is a lack of bloodin the udder to produce the best resultsExtreme care must be taken not to feedanything that will flavor milk just before milking as it will then pass intothe milk -but feed directly after milk-msrMARKETING BUTTERBest Time to Sell Is as Soon as tttProduct Is ReadyThe question often arises with dairyfarmers who make and market theirown butter shall I sell or hold for higher prices Butter depreciates from themoment it is made till it is consumedunder ordinary farm conditions and isalways liable to fluctuations in pricewhich are as often against the holderas in his favor and he is always losingthe interest on its value as long as heholds it Holding for a higher price4s one form of speculation a businessfarmers have no occasion to indulge inIt is true a rise in property may sometimes be foreseen making it pretty safeto hold for a time but when a dairymanwould not think it wise or safe to buybutter or cheese to hold for a betterjirice he had better not hold his ownThe fact that it turns out that he mighthave done better by holding than byselling when his goods are first readyfor market is not a sufficient reasonfor his holding at another time for thechances will as often be against himand whichever wav it is he must alvays endure tihe losses from injuryshrinkage depreciation waste and useof capital Therefore as a rule we sayit is most prudent to sell always whenproducts are read3 for market and mostespecially so with butter which is always suffering from depreciation inquality Rural WorldWoodpeckers Are HelpfulThere is no longer the prejudicewhich used to exist against the woodpecker as the destroyer of valuabletrees which it used to be believed hepecked so as to start the sap to flowing The work he does is almost alAvays on dead wood and he only pecksholes in that to find the insect that hasdeadened the wood and if allowed tolive would ultimately destroy the treeThere is aio more valuable insect destroyer than the woodpecker It isone of the few birds that stay with usall winter and its cheerful peckingcan be heard in almost any woodlandat this season The only complaint weever heard against the woodpecker isthat he destroys early cherries Buthe has earned his part of the cherriesby previously destroying the insect eneniies that would have killed the treeAmerican CultivatorMouumcrt to the

Potato GrowersAs the potato is so largely water itmight be supposed that it is not at allexhaustive But the potato crop is always sold from the land instead of being fed on it The only thing that thepotato takes from the soil is potashand this is largely found in its leavesand stems The tubers also containsome potash and it is this which blackens the knives and hands of those whopeel and cut potatoes A large cropof potatoes it is estimated will take100 pounds of potash an acre from thesoil The best potato growers practicea system of rotating grain and potatoes and in this way keep up the fertility without much difficultyField and ParTHE BOURBON NEWS FRIDAY JANUARY 7 1898mJLAST OF OLD CREMORNESite of tlie Famous London Garden toBe Built UponAbout an acre and a half of groundin Chelsea which has been used forthe past 20 years by W J Bull the orchid grower and nurseryman has beensold and is to be built upon The pieceof ground possesses a history and noordinary one for it is part of the siteof old Cremorne What recollectionsmust rise in the minds of those whoknew London and were acquaintedwith London 20 or 25 years ago at themere mention of the word CremorneIt is strange that there should be nobook dealing with this place in whichwas reflected for 30 years that whichwas universally known as Londonlife The doir gs at the gardens during these years must provide ample materialIt was in 1843 that Cremorne wasfirst opened as a place of entertainment The programme was always avaried one and the element of sensation was always in request Ballooning was the venture which never ceasedto attract for it was conducted in thosedays with more than the ordinaryamount of danger The number of hairbreadth escapes run by the aeronautswas fearful One would come to smashat Walthamstow one dajr anotherwould go for a little trip to Kent andalight with more celerity than graceon the green of some sleepy villageCremorne had many managers butthe one remembered best is BaumDuring his regime the place attained agreat reputation No money wasspared to provide attraction and it iscertain that the people who went thereenjojed themselves to their hearts desire Any evening Cremorne was wortha visit but the time to see it at its bestwas after some great event such as theboat race or the DerbyWhat a night might have beensaid with good reason then There wasa leaven of what is carnival esque aboutit there was an extra fastness in thefun an unusual spirit of gayety abroadLicense for extra time had been granted and fresh arrivals came pouring inuntil a very late hour The theatersand music halls all sent their audiencesdown Cremorne acted as a focus soto speak and centralized all the scattered rays of revelry of the metropolisClubites hired cabs and made their waydown to the gates with all possiblespeedThe end of Cremorne was in 1877First of all some one libeled Mr Baumabout the gardens and there was anaction Mr Baum got one fourth penceand had to pay his own costs A fewmonths later Mr Baum made an application for the renewal of his licensebut the number of people who gave notice of opposition was so great that MrBaum withdrew and the gardens peacefully expiredSuch was Cremorne and now the lastremnant reminding one of its formerglories is to be swept away- LondonMailWOMEN TOURING ALONEAmerican Wives a Source of Wonderment to Ioreigm SistersAmong

rlutfj Iftifo NifrV --The Charm of the PopplesVery anoient is the history of the poppy It was wreathed with the lotus inEgypt and twined with thyme and parsley in Greece It was also one of theflowers dedicated to Venus and thewitches who wrought their spells andmuttered their incantations on themountain tops cast into their brew thehorned leavosIt -was early recognized that the poppy in its simplest form is one of themost decorative of flowers Its simplestform is of course the wild flower offour petals It is treated decoratively ina number of ways either as a flat design of the lifted cup or as a conventional representation of the four petalsencircling the receptacle or as the stemupholding the domelike and sometimesstrongly ridged seed pod but after allthe most marvelous artistic suggestionsare found in the sharply outlined leaveswhich rise to slender Gothic pointsThese serve as models of leaf design andwere carved boldly and delicately in thestone of aacient cathedralsThere is always something artificialin the appearance of the cultivated poppies They lack tho stability or realityand ever suggest the gypsy masquerading as the princessPoppies with very few exceptionsare not in the least difficult to growSeed sown in the fall or spring willproduce plants that flower all summerThey do not demand an enriched soiland profuse watering but grow in anindependent careless

TableIiUthers BonesIt is generally supposed that thebones of tlie great reformer were tornfrom their last resting place in thechurch of the castle of Wittenberg during the Thirty Years war and scatteredto the winds like those of WyclifAt all events no trace of Luthers tombhas hitherto been discovered One ofthe biographers of Luther Herr Koesfelin of Halle has however raised nolittle sensation in religious circles inGermany by a recent article in a theological magazine which throwsover theaccepted explanation of the disappearance of the returners tomb as mere fiction He declares that two workmenengaged on the restoration oil the churchin Wittenbecg castle came across thecoffin and body of LutherfwithoutT letting any of their comrades know oftheir find It is alleged that they entered the chapel by night and dug out theremains secretly reinterring them infear of arrest There ought to be nodifficulty in discovering whether therois any truth in Herr Koestlins statement
