"Sever Hours in New York:""
The big laughing song play, "Sev
en Hours In New York," now in its
second year, is announced for The
Paris Grand,. January 16. From all
reports this attraction has "had" a
most remarkable , career. A theat
rical attraction may be ever so: mer
itorious, but unless it comes herald
ed with a "New York or Chicago run,
it fails to attract more than: passing
notice. Not so with "Seven Hours in.
New York."The" producers felt that
they had the goods, and, after en
gaging a fine company and chorus,
equipped them with the best scenery
and costumes that money couuld buy,
they boldly started" out, firm In the
belief that the public would re
spond. And the. publis did. "Seven

of the two. plays Ik New York "Tlie
Lure" and "The Fight" rightly
closed by municipal authority ob, the
grounds of immorality.
For sometime there-has been a lean
ing toward plays of this sort, at
least of questionable morality. The 3
climax was reached when the two
mentioned, were maib- to- close theirs
doors. Now comes this remarkable j
play with its vital lesson of truth and
charity, for its theme- iff based on St.
Paul's Epistle to the Corinthians,
thirteenth chapter and first verse,
"Though- I speak with the tongues of j
angels and have not charity I am be-
come as- sounding bra3s or a tinkling,
cymbal!" This is one or the most
familiar verses in the New Testa
mentr certainly it is St. Paul's most
famous writing and known and ae
ceptevT everywhere there is Christ-
ianity.
It must not be thought that Miss
Crossman is coming to preach, a ser
mon: with this bit of Scripture as her
text- Nothing of the. sort. It is true
that the theme of "The Tongues of
Men" is -wrought out of St. Paul's fa
mous writing, but it Is a play' just the
same as one that is intensely effect
ive in Its situations and dialogue and
equally scintllating in its wit and
humor, thus replacing them with
smiler. the mastery of which has no
equal. (13-2t);

"The Trail of the Lost Chord,"" an,
American feature picture in two
parts. Those who have read Ade
laide Proctor's poem, or heard Sir
Arthur Sullivan's famous song, writ
ten around it, may easily wonder how
it is possible to make a thrilling
drama, brim-full of action, out of
what is merely a beautiful touch of
sentiment, with no more substance
than a dream. But it has been ac
complished in this motion picture
play. "The Milk We Drink," an edu
cational film which shows proper

For months Paris citiseae have
jeen in these columns enthusiastic
praise of Doan's Kliney Pills by Par
is residents. Would these prominent
people recommend & remedy that
had not proven reliable? Would
they confirm their statemeats . after
years had elajsed if personal expe
rience had not showa the remedy to
be worthy of endorsement? Tie fol
lowing statement should carry convic
tion to the mind of every Paris citi
zen: Mrs. Ida Huffman, 115 Main street,
Paris, Ky., says: "We think Dean's
Kidney Pills are just fine. We will
ingly confirm the endorsement we
ave them some years ago. I suf
fered from pains across the small of
my back. Seeing Doan's Kidney
?ills advertised I got a supply at
Wilson's (now Chas. E. Butter & Co)
lrug store, and gave them a trial,
f was very much pleased with the
esult."
