For Cancer
Few people are born entirely free from
tlood taint This is often vry slight or
xemote and sometimes may not develop
s all in one generation bnt breaks out
fin a serious disease later x
Cancer the most dreadful of all
is often the result of some blood
taint inherited from generations back
lit often appears as a mere mole or in
significant pimple which later develops
an alarming condition No one
3aiows but that he may be subject to an
- -inherited impurity in the blood nor caa
3ie tell whether or not this may some
day crop out in the form of destructive
-cancer It is therefore important that
cany little sore or scratch which does
raiot readily heal be given prompt atten
tion or a serious condition may result
Mr Robert Smedley of Ocala Fla
-was the victim of a malignant cancer
-which first appeared in the ananner
bora described He writes
fit first I paid no attention to the
little blotches on my face thinking they
-would soon pass away Before long
liowever they became sore and soon
egan to enlarge I applied ordinary
local remedies but they had no effect
I then consulted a physician When
T3ie told me I had cancer I became
alarmed and hastened to obtain treat-
for I knew how dangerous cancer
357as
I received the best medical
3ion but the cancer continued to
rgrow worse until the physicians
-finally said that I would have to
2iave an operation performed as that
- -was the only hope for me This I re
irused to submit to as I knew cancer was
a blood diseaseand my common sense
iold me that it was folly to expect an
operation to cure a blood disease -
Knowing S S S to be a good blood
rjxemedy I decided to try it and the first
r3xttle produced an improvement I
continued the medicine and in four
anonths the last scab dropped off Ten
years have elapsed and not a sign oi
the disease has returned
The alarming increase in the number
of deaths which occur as the result of a
surgical operation is attracting general
attention and a strong sentiment against
such methods of treatment is fast de
veloping among the most intelligent
-classes It seems that in almost every
-case were the doctors treatment is
-unsuccessful the learned physicians de
cide at once that an operation must be
performed and the keen blade of the
surgeon is recklessly resorted to
The many caustic plasters which are
applied to remove cancers are more pain
ful than death and the danger of a
gical operation as great as the disease
itseif No or surgical
atio t cm cu cancer because it is
a biood disease the destructive cancer
cells are in the blood and cannot be
-cut out or removed by local treatment
As the disease must be forced from the
Tblood it is ouly reasonable to rely upon
- real blood remedy for a cire one
-which goes direct to the cause of the
itrouble and removes it

Iknown cure for cancer and other obsti
nate and deep seated blood dis ses such
as Scrofula Eczema Catarrh Rheuma
tism and Contagious Blood Poison It is

ureiy v egetaDie
-and is the only blood remedy guaran
teed to contain not a particle of mercury
potash or other mineral which means
-so much to all who know the disastrous
-effects of these drugs

Singing of Old Dog Tray
There is mack in a name or at least
t t i c caid Alhfirh Gerard Thiers
DINING AND FEEDING
mo ncpfl tr nstr if I was German As l
speak French and not German I con
cluded to change my name to Thiers
My wife is an American bnt she has
lived so long in Paris that she speaks
French like a native and has nothing
German in her appearance or manners
Did yon sing in French to King
Cetewayo
No I sang in English The old
Zulu was in captivity when I saw him
in Africa I was singing in Cape Colony
in my boyhood days with an English
opera company and after it stranded I
visited the dethroned African monarch
The English kept him guarded at a
farmhouse but allowed him privileges
I sang several operatic airs for him but
they did not please him and in despair
I tried4 Old Dog Tray He liked it
and when told the story he said a dog
was faithful and wished me to sing it
again Then he embarrassed me exceed
ingly by presenting me with two of his
wives Each was more than six feet in
height and black as the ace of spades I
declined his royal offer although he de
clared the wives would not be missed

American Table Manners Not So Open to
Criticism as Formerly
It has been conceded that the degree
of civilization a people has reached may
be accurately measured by its dietary
Now some one has said that the
American feeds the Englishman de
vours the Frenchman dines In view
of this statement one wonders what the
English have been doing through the
centuries to have advanced so little We
do not pretend to answer for them but
would say for ourselves we have been
hewing our way through forests pio
neering in every direction in every
sense ample apology for feeding in
stead of dining
But of course it was a Frenchman
who made the declaration and of
course he made it long ago when mor
tifying though it be honesty compels
us to acknowledge that we may have
been guilty Times however and con
ditions have changed and not even the
most bigoted Frenchman will refuse to
admit that when the American has
reached the dining point he will have
more to dine upon than any other man
in the world The culture of man in
America will demand all the art in his
cuisine that France by study has evolv
ed with the added merit of honesty in
his food the disguises incident to pov
erty of material not being a necessity
wo mo leurmug to use our materials as
rapidly as we have been obliged to
learn all other things Ella Morris

What Wrestlers Should Eat
The Japanese wrestlers are a race of
giants they often weigh from 14 to 2
stone At the Imperial hotel in Tokyo
once they brought their champion wres
tler to my room He was prodigious in
size and as fat and fair as a baby He
was a Hercules in strength but looked
like an overgrown cherub of Correggio
What do you eat I asked
Rice nothing but rice
Why not eat meat
Meat is weakening Beef is 70 per
cent water Rice is 80 per cent food 3
ate lean beefsteak once and my strength
left me The other man ate rice and
threw me down
My courier said This wrestler is
the champili of Japan No one can
throw him Pearsons Weekly

the specially cured hams of which there
is a growing demand in the state The
pigs are fattened on sterilized milk

a uniform weight The hams are cured

Some Plain Facts
Grave errors injustice wrongs of
greater or less degree arise from lack
of knowledge of the truth and more
frequently froni deception vgfV
The most infamous case oiftrecofd
of deception and injustice is the at
tempt to demonetize silver as a money
of final redemption in the United
States
There is no learned judge skilled
There is no department of supply in lawyer or court of justice that is
which we have not the advantage and I capable of reconciling the effort with
the constitutional laws that govern
the issue of money in this country
The people have been deceived
officials in power chosen to adminis
ter justice under the laws have
ignored their sworn duty and given
aid to the scheme that has paralyzed
industry reduced property values
one half and beggared millions
There is no authority of law either
specific or by inference by which
gold alone is made the only money
with which to discharge debts either
public or private The effort to
make it so is unconstitutional and a
national calamity
Plain and ample information facts
and truth concerning this almost suc
cessful scheme to corner the wealth
of the people is now being printed
in the Cincinnati Enquirer a news
paper which the combined power of
money has failed to muzzle or buy
