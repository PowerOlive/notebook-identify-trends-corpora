Renaissance a cornet was tmiver tmiversallysally supposed to be a vapor in the at atmospheremosphere presaging pestilence wars warsandand the death of kings The Danish as astronomertronomer Tycho Brake was the first to toshowshow that comets lay in the celestial celestialspacesspaces beyoud our atmosphere and andNewtonNewton proved that the heads of com cometsets Obeyed the law of gravitation like likeotherother celestial bodes bodesWeWe caii now siiy with considerable considerableassuranceassurance that a comets head consists consistsofof a swarm of meteors surrounded and andinterspersedinterspersed with a gaseous atmos atmospherephere which renders It T luminous and andthereforetherefore visible bj continuous inter internalnal discharges When the atmosphere atmospheredisappearsdisappears and the discharges cease ceasethethe head becomes invisible and the theII comet becomes a simple meteor swarm swarmTheThe most puzzling thing about a acometi comet has always been its tail and itis only within recent rears that we wehavehave begun to know enough about mat matterter in a finely divided state to be able ableII to offer any satisfactory y yfor explanationfor it Its most obvious peculiarity is isthatthat it does not obey the lbw of gravi gravitationtation tationThatThat the tail is gaseous is clearly clearlyrovetlrovetl bythe spectroscope
