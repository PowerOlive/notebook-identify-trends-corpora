That'stoc&use my two daughters and I talkmuch about Tanlac. We all wearthe Tanlac Smile, too," Mrs. S. C.Burnett, 1408 Walnut street, said."But why shouldn't we talk aboutit when we feel that it has done us awtrld of good. Everyone of us hasWen helped by Tanlac and 111 tell youire can't say too much for it.'First my older daughter, Mrs. JohnLtwe, tried it. She had lost 30 poundsawl was bo run down and nervous thatmreo. the rumbling of a wagon or thetanning of a door would upset herfr hours. We feared we would havete send her to a hospital."I honestly believe that Tanlacaayed her from complete breakdown.Utthing else seemed to help her. ButTfcnlac put her on her feet again rightmmlck. Today she is one of the hapyfest women in Cincinnati."Then Frances became run downrt of half-sick. She had dizzyspells. We were going to take hernt of school because she kept comptaining of spots and webs before herjes. Her complexion got pasty andie didn't look a bit well. Tanlackvwever, proved to be just the thingske needed and now she is back ingd health again.Mother Was Ha!f-S:ck."As for myself, I felt almost thesuae as Mrs. Lowe. My stomachtroubled me. My appetite was pooraad I suffered after eating with bloatimg and belching of gas. But withimm help of Tanlac I got rid of thesettttobles and now I feel simply splen-"But I started out at first to tellyou about Mrs. Lowe. She simplythought she was. going to die. Shefelt so bad I believe she almost wouldhave been glad to have it all endedIt was just pitiful to watch her. Herweight dropped from 140 to 110pounds. She couldn't eat without being sick. We had just about givenher up. Then we heard of Tanlac andshe tried it. All of a sudden sheseemed to take new interest in life.Within a week she began eating solidfood, just like she did before she hadtrouble with her stomach. The foodnourished her, too, and she began taking on weight. She slept sound andit seemed like 1.0 tvme before she wasfeeling well again.Helps Youngest Girl."One d&y Frances was up to seeher sister. She's the youngest, youknow. She was feeling bad and Mrs.Lowe gave her some Tanlac. It madeher feel better and she came home andsaid, 'Mama, I believe that new tonicthat helped sister will do me somegood. Please get me a bottle.' So Idid and do you know that in a weekshe began to feel better. Now sheeats all she wants, sleeps well anddoesn't have those dizzy spells orspots before her eyes when she issh"l ";-"."I was such a firm believer in Tanlac byhealthsome for myself. It certainly tonedup my system.

It wasthe original intention to hold the meeting in Lexingion, on account of It3central location, but after consultationthe meeting place was changed to Cincinnati. Representatives from all thetowns mentioned as candidates for theLeague .will attend this meeting.A brilliant prospect has been openedup to the promotors with the newsfrom Covington that Garry Hermann,owner of the Cincinnati Reds, has atilast given his consent to allow the'Blue Grass League to place a team inCovington. It vas the threatened invasion of the river town in 1913 thatcaused the expulsion of the Blue GrassLeague from the protection of the National Baseball Commission. Therewas a ruling tihat a minor leaguecould not place a team In the fivemile limit of a major league. Covington was within the limit and when themagnates were too strenuous in theirdemands on the commission they wenoutlawed. The Blue Grass League ha'lbeen a success financially, and nianjstar players were graduated from theteams then playing.I According to the information reaching here Wednesday it has been practically settled that the towns whichwill be represented in the League are:I Paris, Maysville, Lexington, WinchesIter. Covington, Newport, Frankfortand Richmond, with Georgetown, Lawrenceburg, Versailles, Shelbyville, MtSterling and Nicholasville all trying tohave tihe limit extended so as to takethem in.NEW SUBSRIBERSInstalled By The Paris HomeTelephone & Telegraph Co,PwMillions ofhousewives know this is thetruth they realize the cost of asingle bake-day failure.
