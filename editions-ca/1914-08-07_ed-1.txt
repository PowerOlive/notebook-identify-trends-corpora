Theprospect of a serious shortage in the'water supply for the city is becomingmore apparent each day, and it willsoon be imperative for all consumers Ito restrict themselves to actual needs. !The 'water in Stoner Creek is gettinglower each day the drouth continues;and there is no immediate relief insight in the way of much-neededrains.We have heard of a number ofhousekeepers who have been veryreckless, in fact, wasteful, in turningthe water on from theirstreet hoseto water flower beds and permittingthe water to waste. This should bestopped, for unless conditions improve, the situation here will soon beserious.It should be a matter of consideration for the needs of others, and selfish interests should not stand in theway. The actual needs of the manyshould take precedence over the selfishness of a few.Mr. Mitchell wishes to impressthese facts upon the patrons of theWater Company's service, as it is amatter of supreme importance and urgent necessity. Don't waste the water, and your conservation of the supply will be of lasting benefit to themany who wrill really need what youare now wasting.BIBLE SCHOOL MEETINGIThe Bourbon County Bible SchoolAssociation of the Christian Churchwill hold its annual convention at theMt.

War has been declared by the district authorities onthe blinding headlights of automobileswithin the city limits. The commis'sioners have instructed Major Sylvester, superintendent of police, to confer with the corporation counsel, andformulate some regulation of the present evil. The present traffic regulations do not contain any provision forthe restriction of the use of such headlight which would hold in a court oflaw.Much of the present danger arisesout of the carelessness of motoristsand pedestrians themselves. Motoristsspinning over the roads in the adjacent parks and thoroughfares leadinginto the city limits needlessly leavetheir headlights burn in the adequately lighted sections. Pedestriansthoughtlessly walk in the middle ofthe road instead of keeping to theright and to the side of the road.Much of the present danger. dfh beeliminated by a little care and thought,but the problem of the nonglare headlight is twofold. First, the dazzlingrays must be eliminated or the use ofsuch lights restricted in some way,and second, the original illuminatingqualities of the headlight must be conserved. Adequate light on the public highways is needed today more than everbefore. The heavy black oiled roadsmake it much more difficult to distinguish pedestrians on the highwaysthan it was in the early days of theautomobile, before the roads wereoiled.Still another factor in the problemis the quietness of the present-daymotor. It is now possible to creep upwithin a few feet of another car orpedestrian on the road -without thembeing aware of the approach of a car.Experiments are being conductedthroughout the country, and the localofficials are keeping in close touchwith every development. Until somedevice is invented relief will have tocome through regulation.From Los Angeles, Cal., comes theword of a simple solution of the problem. The means consists of a lensmolded hemispherically and sandblasted to give a frosted 'appearanceexcept for a small oval space slightlybelow the center, which is left transparent. When seen from the height ofthe driver's seat the frosted surface isbetween the eyes and the filament andone sees only the diffused circle oflight and the form of the approachingcar is visible.The beam of light coming throughthe clear oval is centralized on theroad directly and far ahead instead ofas with the old style flat glass over awidening arc. The road is madebrighter by the contrast and the diffused light coming through the frostedsurface enables the driver to clearlysee the front of his own car, even inthe face of an approaching blindingsearchlight.Civilization's Advance.How timid and puny seem the oldtime roar of the ocean, the crowing ofroosters and the creak of farm wagonswhen nowadays, as we linger in somedistant caravansary, we recruit ourwasted energies on hesitation, ragtime, phonographs, telephone bellsand siren horns.SUMMER COUGHS ARE DANGEROUS.

'London. Salvage experts heragree that there is a fair chance ofrecovering the million dollars' worthof silver said to be aboard the sunkenEmpress of Ireland. R. H. Davis,managing director of the salvagecompany, called attention to the following successful operations of thissort:Four thousand one hundred andtwenty-six bars of silver of the valueof $2,681,900, 46 boxes of gold' of thevalue of $1,000,000 and nine boxes ofsilver 'of the value of $5,850, a totalvalue of $3,687,750 recovered fromthe Oceana, which was wrecked Inabout thirteen fathoms of water offEastbourne.Four hundred and fifty thousandgold coin 25 peseta pieces recovered from the wreck of the AlphonsoXII, which was sunk in 27 fathomsof water a greater depth than thatat which the Empress of Ireland Islying off Point Gando, Grand Canary.Fifty thousand dollars' worth of-silver bars all but six that were onboard recovered from the Skyro,wrecked in 32 fathoms of water offCape Finisterre."In the case of the Alphonso XIIthe difficulties were very great," Mr.Davis said, "and our diver, Alexander Lambert, had to use dynamite toremove innumerable obstructions before he could get to, the magazine inwhich the treasure was stored."Dynamite had also to be used lnthe operations for salving the sliverbars of the Skyro and when the workwas finished the vessel was just aheap of scrap iron. The Empress ofIreland is said to be lying on herside in 17 fathoms 102 feet of water. "At this depth," Mr. Davis said, "aman cannot remain safely for a longertime than thirty or forty minutes.He would have to allow himself,moreover, about half an hour to geton the surface. The ascent from the.depth is a painfully slow business."When a man works at these submarine depths he is subject to an abnormal pressure which is increased4 pounds for every ten feet he goesdown. At work beneath fathoms ofwater his blood and tissues becomesaturated with nitrogen."For this reason he has to be mostcareful in ascending to the surface,for otherwise a sort of effervescencewould be set up in the blood vesselsand cause paralysis."There is no difliculty in gettingdivers for salvage operations. Mostof our men are ex-British navydivers, who are without doubt themost scientifically trained in theworld."For his work in salving the pesetasfrom the wreck of the Alphonso XII,Alexander Lambert received five percent of the treasure recovered $17,500 in addition to his pay of $250 amonth."LARGEST ZOO ELEPHANT DEADEmpress, Thirty-Eight Years In Zoo atPhiladelphia, Breaks Leg inRush for Bath.Philadelphia.

I have the deepestsympathy for all who suffer, and yetI must confess that the greater portion of the suffering of which mankind is called upon to endure, is theresult of indecision and delay uponthe part of the patient in takingtreatment. Why the suffering mortal should refuse to take hold of thehand which is outstretched to help, isa thing which I cannot understand.It seems to me that any suffererwould hail with gratitude a discovery like this one.

In the afternoon theBanda Romas gave half an hour prelude and were followed by JacobRandolph Perkins, of Iowa, in his famous lecture, "Wit and Hajf Wits,"which was good, dicerent in stylefrom any that had preceded.
