In 1867 Mr. Fisher 'wasteaching "s school -at Black's CrossRoads, Bourbon county, and wasboarding with M. Joe McClelland,who lived on the Jackstown pike, orat least near -that pike. Mr. Murphy was staying also at Mr. McCielland's' while doing r.ome work on theplace. He and Mr. Fisher were goodfriends.One day vwhile.Mr- Murphy wassitting on (he front porch- he sawMr ..Fisher come up to the porch,clean -his shoes on a rug, and gointo the house, apparently up stairsto his room. "I'll not speak to him,"thought Mr. Murphy, "unless hespeaks to me, for he is looking rightat me." At dinner a little while afterwards, Mr. Fisher did not .appearand some one wondered why he didnot come."I saw birfi go up to his room justawhile ago," said Mr. Murphy, "maybe you had better send up for him."But Mr. Fisher was not found inhis room, and afterwards it developed that he had not been on the placeat that time. NWhen he did appear and Mr.Murphy told him of having seen his"ghost" on the. porch, Mr. Fteherdeclared that it meant either hewMr. Murphy would die soon, or bothwiuld live to ripe old age.Mr. Murphy has reached an agethat perhaps may be called "ripej'and he would like to know what hasbecome of Mr. Fisher.

Parker Moon, who for afull half century has devoted hislif and talents to Sunday schooland organization work for the Society of Friends or Quakers."Uncle Parker," as he is more fapiiliarly known, came from fine oldrugged Quaker stock, and . there isnot a better known or more highlyrespected citizen in tfcat part of theState.. In referring tc his remarkable restoration to health by Tanlac, he said:"About five years ago I suffered ageneral breakdown. My principaltrouble was nervous indigestion."My appetite was very poor and myfood seldom agreed with me, and Ihad' to live on a very restricted, diet.I suffered a great deal from headaches and dizzy spells; I had severepains across the 'small of my backand was badly constipated most ofthe time. In fact, I was so weak andrundown. I was not able to attend tomy duties."This condition ,vnade uae verynervous and I could not sleep ' atnight. Frequently I would lie awakemost all night and was in that condition more or less for. five years.My physician said he could not doanything for me and suggested achange, of climate. I then moved toTexas and went back and forththree times but did not get the reliefI had hoped for. Finally, I got sobad off I was not able to get aroundwith any degree of comfort. I wasalso told I had heart trouble."I had read about Tanlac and, asIt had been very highly recommended to me, I decided to try it I gota bottle and had taken only a fewdoses until I could notice a markedimprovement in my condition. I noticed especially that I was nottroubled any more with sour stomach. "I kept on taking Tanlac until Ifully regained my health. My appetite is splendid; I enjoy my mealsand do not find it necessary now totske any laxative medicines of anykind. I can sleep much, "better andam not nearly so neivous."I take great pleasure in recommending Tanlac to anyone whoneeds a good system builder, or whoBuffers with stopnach trouble. Ihave recommended Tanlac to a greatmany of my friends and am pleasedto reach, others by giving this statement for publication."Tanlac is sold in Paris at the People's Pharmacy.
