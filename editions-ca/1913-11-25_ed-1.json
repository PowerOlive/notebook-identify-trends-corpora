Actress. ,
Against
Miss Lola May, an actress, Is be
ing sued in New York for $50,000
danviges by Mr. Marie Crandall,
who alleges that the actress alien
ated the aifections of her husband,
Derby Grarfdall, a stock broker.
Crandall, from whom his 'wife has
obtained a separation, was a member
of his firm.
Miss May, whose name -off the
stage is May Pu'rman, lives at 62
West Thirty-nintfc street.
According to-me complaint of Mrs.
Crandall, Crandall was attentive to
Miss May as far back as 1909, even
before his wife sued him -for a sepa
ration. Mrs. Crandall saidher first
intimation of the It riendship of Miss
May and her husband was when she
.found a bill in his pocket for a cost
ly hat, -which Ire had bough from 'a
Fifth avenue milliner and sent to me
actress, who was then living in
Washington, D. C.
. "My husband was devoted to me,"
said Mrs. Crandall, "and we were per
fectly happy until he met the actress
and she lurpd him away. ' After he,
began spending his time ;vvith her he
neglected me, and treated me so
cruelly that I had to sue him for a
Reparation. '
"I have had this actress put out of
three or four restauranjts and one re
spectable hotel through telling of
her friendship for my husband, and
yet she ,had the effrontery to come up
to my table in a restaurant the other
night and ask if I wnted to see her."

Last Friday.

Hetty Green was 78 -years old last
Friday, but she does not like to be
reminded otit. She celebrated by
getting on the joTa . an hour earlier,
than usual, just to make herself for
get how old she was. Being the rich
est woman, in America apparently
has agreed with her. ,for she looks
ten 'years younger than she really is.
Mrs. Green entered her office on
the parlor floor of her home and soon
pfter was ready to go down town to
discuss business with a few banks
and other cbrnorations. She wsts met
on the steps by a -large ssortmeant of
reoorters and photographers.
"Congratulations," said a 'lady sob
artist.
"I thank you for the congratula
tions," replied Mrs Green, "but you
must not remind me, that this is my
birthday. I do' not like to be told
that I am. getting oldr indeed I try to
make myself believe just the oppo
site, that I am growing younger.
And that is the way I really feel."
"I am never without s my onion."
Mrs. Green confided. "The strength
of the onion kills the germs one

eaten onions constantly for years
apd they have kept me healthy."
Mrs. Green expressed disapproval
of the tango and the new styles 'for

TWO POINTS OF VIEW.
No WQrk under Jieaven is more
imperative than the rescue of young
and innocent girls; n'o crime is more
dastardly tjian the sale of their youth
and innocence; no charity is greater
than that which lifts the sinner from
her sin. But the fact that we habit
ually apply the term "white slave" to
the wilful prostitute as wpll as to the
entrapped child snows mat a power
ful and popular sentime'nt is absolved
from the shackles of accuracy. Also
that this absolution ccmfuses the mind
of men. The sentimentalist pities the
prostitute as a victim, the sociologist
abhors her as a menace. The senti
mentalist conceives that men prey,
and -vyomen are preyed upon; tne so
ciologist, aware that evil men and
women prey upon one another cease
lesly and ravenously, has no measure
of tenderness for either The senti
mentalist cling tenaciously to the
assopiation of youth with innocerice.
The sociologist knows that even age
limit which the law fixes as a bound
ry line pt innQcence has no corre
sponding restriction in fact. It is in
conceivable that so many books and
pamphlets dealing with this subject
books and pamphlets to be found in
every library shell, and in the hands

nore th'e balance of depravity, sway

Judge Cochran in the Federal Court
that railroad property should be
