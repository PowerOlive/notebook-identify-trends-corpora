Sydney Smiths Joke
Sydney Smith was very happy in his
country life and his children caught
jis spirit of delight over common
hiugs They loved animals and spent
long hours in truining them One little
beast a baby donkey became under
their tuition perhaps the most accom
plishes of his species and unconscious
ly gave rise to a quatrain which now
belongs to the fame of Sydaey Smith
The donkey was a well educated chap
He would walk up stairs follow the
family in their rambles like a dog and
when they entered his meadow run to
meet them with ears down and tail
erect braying joyously
O day when Billys head was
crowue with flowers and he was being
trained with a handkerchief for a bridle
Mr Jeffrey unexpectedly arrived He
joined in the sport and to the childrens
infinite delight mounted Billy
Thus he was proceeding in triumph
when Sydney Smith and his wife with
three friends returned from a walk and
took in the festal scene The great man
advanced with extended hands and
greeted his old friend in an impromptu
which ha8 become familiar to the read
ing world
Witty as Horatius Flaccus
Ah jjreat a Jacobin as Gracchus
Short though not as Cat as Bacchus
Seated on a little jackass

The Death of Concliinjc
The coaching system died a lingering
a lamentable death I can remember
something of a few coaches in remote
districts which longest escaped strangu
lation and memory of those distant
days has been sweeter without them
They resemble what Nimrod describes
as the obsolete old fashioned coach of
his boyhood drawn by dispirited ill
fed jades over long stages One of his
paragraphs well describes vhit used to
rrake my blood boil with impotent
fury imbittering the joy of returning
hme for the holidays and deepening
the depression of the schoolward jour
ney
The four horse whip and the Not
tingham whipcord were of no avail over
the latter part of the ground and some
thing like a was pro
duced out of the boot which was jocu
larly called the appientice and a
shrewd apprentice it was to the art of
torturing which was inflicted on the
wheelers without stint or measure but
without which the coach might have
been often left on the road
No the last of the road coaches
corruptio optimi disappeared and left
none to mourn them Blackwoods

Bribing Spnrgeon
The autobiography of the late Rev
Charles H Spnrgeon contains an ac
count of what may be termed an early
business venture and its influence on
his character
Spurgeon was brought up on Watts
hymns but not altogether willingly
His grandmother coaxed him with
money to learn them At first she gave
him a penny but when she saw how
easily it was earned the old lady re
duced the prize to a halfpenny and then
to a farthing There is no telling how
low the amount per hymn might have
fallen but just at this time his grand
father made a discovery which seemed
more desirable to Spurgeon
He discovered that his house was
overrun with rats and offered his
grandson a shilling a dozen for all he
could kill
The occupation of rat killing gave
him more money than learning hymns
But Mr Spnrgeon characteristically
eays I know which employment has
been the more permanently profitable
to me
All BaRlneos
Im afraid our new son-in-law isnt
much of a business man she said
Dont you worry about that re
plied the old gentleman If he doesnt
know how to make the best of a bargain
I dont know who does The day before
the wedding he discovered that Minnie
had a freckle under hei left ear and he
made rue add 1000 to her dowry on
the ground that the goods werent en
tirely in accordance with the invoice I
was almost tempted to believe that he
wasnt a nobleman at all but a New
England Yankee in disguise Chicago

Practical Classics
Mrs Timkins was taking her son to
school for the first time and after im
pressing the schoolmaster with the ne
cessity of his having a thoroughly good
education finished up by saying And
be sure he learns Latin
But my dear madam said the
schoolmaster Latin is a dead lan
guage
All right said Mrs Timkins
Hell want it Hes going to be an un
dertaker London Tit Bits
An Awful Sentence
A celebrated Irish judge once passed
sentence in the following manner The
prisoner was a butler who had been
convicted of stealing his masters wine
Dead to every claim of natural affec
tion blind to your own real interests
you have burst through all the restraints
of religion and morality and have for
many years been feathering your own
nest with your masters bottles Lon

A Monster Flower
The largest flower in the world it is
said is the bolo which grows on the
island of Mindanao one of the Philip

nearly a yard in width and a single
flower has been known to weigh 22
pounds It grows on the highest pinna
cle of the land or about 2500 feet
above the level of the sea
