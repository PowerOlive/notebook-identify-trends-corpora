A. Bowmar, in its issue of lastweek declares for Claude M. Thomasfor the Democratic nomination forCongress in an editorial signed by Mr.A. A. Bowmar. Mr. Bowmar says:"The Sun takes pleasure in declaring for Hon. Claude M. Thomas forCongress in this district. We supported Mr. Thomas in his Congressionalrace several years ago and we areglad, to do it again." "Furthermore, we are not only forMr. Thomas, but we are against Mr.Cantrill, not only . by reason of ouradvocacy of Mr. Thomas, but outsideof that."Yet I will say again, what has beensaid in these columns before, there isabsolutely nothing personal in ourfight on Mr. Cantrill. The personalieeling of both the Sun's editors toward Mr. Cantrill is entirely kind andthere is no reason why it should beotherwise. I will go further and saythat some of the attacks on Mr. Cantrill Jn the past have gone beyondthe bounds of what 1 could approve."I am opposed to Mr. Cantrill beacuse he stands for that in publiclife against which I am enlisted tofight as long as I have tongue or pen.Mr. Cantrill is the friend and representative of the whisky interests. Mr.Cantrill, in his political methods andhis political affiiliations, is for everything that I am against."I believe in throwing the saloonpower bodily out of politics and keeping it out. I believe in temperancelegislation. I believe in abosolutenuritv in elections. I believe in referring everything to the people and notto the politicians. How could I possibly support Mr. Cantrill, the friendof the liquor interests, the enemy oftemperance legislation, the 'framerup' of the proposed 'snap primary' of1913 the plainest, most undeniabletrampling on the people's rightswhich I have ever seen. I can notand will not."I have no personal attack to makeon Mr. Cantrill at all, for personal attacks generally require personal prejudice. I am against Mr. Cantrill ongrounds which require no proof themere statement of which carries confirmantion with it. I do not care- totake up other old charges which,whether true or false, would no doubthnvp slumbered forever had Mr. Cantrill not displeased those who dugthem up. And I hope that in this campaign there will be no personal mudslinging and that Mr. Cantrill will bejudged by his political attitude andaffiiliations."Nobody in the district can doubtthat Claude Thomas has all the equipment to make a good and useful Congressman. He is a good lawyer, aman of affairs, a man of long legislative experience a man who commands respect. There can be nothought that Mr. Cantrill would makea better Congressman. The issue isnarrowed down to a question ofwhisky domination over the people ofthis State or clean politics. Are youfor clean politics and the destructionof the political power of the saloons?If so, ou can't stand with Cantrillwithout stulifying yourself. Are youfor the kind of politics that framed upthe snap primary, do you believe inthe whisky power in politics, do youstand with the politicians, rather thanwith the people? If so, you have nobusiness in the Thomas camp."The result of the coming primarywill show where the people of theSeventh District stand. If Mr. Cantrill wins, it means either that this isa whiskv district or that the temperance people have a yarn string for a"backbone."If the people of Woodford, whostand against the whisky power, whostand for clean elections and straightpolitics, expect anybody to believe ourprofessions, it is up to us to roll up abig majority for Thomas. The manwho has convictions and will stand bythem and with them, is1 a poor citizenif not a bad citizen and a mighty weakman, if not a bad man."A. A. B.VThe Kentucky statute making it legal for farmers to pool their tobaccowas annulled as unconstitutional bythe United States Supreme Court atWashington yesterday.The sourt held that the convictionof Patrick Collins, a farmer of MasonCounty, Kentucky, for selling his tobacco to an outsider after agreeing topool with the Burley Tobacco Society,a tobacco growers organization, wasinvalid. Collins had been fined $150.The conviction of Thomas Malone,another Kentucky tobacco grower,also was set aside.In substance, the court found thatas a result of the passage of the tobacco pooling act the Kentucky Statecourt held that the trust law of theState was that any combination waslegal that did not enhance or depressprices above or below real value.The court that it was beyond humaningenuity to determine what was"real value" of an article " under imaginary conditions.Paris Taken Into Camp "ByLexington Same TeamsPlay To-day.STREET CONTRACTORS WAITARRIVAL OF MATERIAL.The contractors who have in handthe work of resurfacing Main Streetwith the Warren patent Bitulic surfaceare ready to proceed withthe work assoon as the material arrives.

He told mewhat he stood for when lie was herea few weeks ago and they agreedwith my views exactly.

J. A. SHARON RESIGNSAS HEAD OF NEWPORT SCHOOLSProf. J. A. Sharon, formerly Superintendent of the Paris City Schools,tendered his resignation Wednesdayas Superintendent of the NewportPublic Schools,, following the announcement by the Newport schoolcommissioners that they had passeda resolution reducing his salary.In speaking of his resignationProf. Sharron said: "Under the present condition of the public schools ofNewport, due to retrenchment inmoney matters, the superintendentwill meet many obstacles. The question of a cut in salary, together withadded burdens and responsibilities,made my action absolutely necessary.The position of second-class citiesduring the last three years has become much harder to fill from everystandpoint. The additional responsibilities added to regular labors makesit out of the question for me to remainat a reduced salary."Prof. Sharon held the position ofinstructor of mathematics at the Kentucky State University before goingto Newport. He made an excellentrecord as head of the public schoolsbringing them up to a high standardof efficiency.There ws not the slightest disagreement between members of theboard and Prof. Sharon, as the latter's work was entirely, satisfactory.In the line of retrenchment the Superintendent's salary was reduced$250.

Miss' Stearns is a member ofthe Wisconsin State Library Boardand acted as chairman of a conference at Chicago on literary extension.It is proposed, as one blow to booksdealing frankly with plots involvingsex problems, fo boycott them at allbranches, and as another that members of women's clubs pledge themselves not to buy, read or permittheir sons or daughters to read suchbooks."A wise librarian," said MissStearns, "never puts a book on hisshelves unless it answers affirmatively on these questions will it inform,will it inspire, will it refresh?"The provence of the novel is torefresh and sometimes to inspire.The greatest problem which librarians have to meet is the'enormous output of books. With some publishersit has sturck 'Six O'clock,' and librarians have a hard time, knowing thetitles and authors only, to discriminate concerning that sort of thing."ONLY ONEENTIRELYTORY.SATISFAC-"I have tried various colic and diarrhoea remedies but the only one thathas given me entire satisfaction andcured me when I was afflicted isChamberlain's Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy.

At the time of thewas carried into effect the adhesiveopstage stamp. At the the time ofpassing ot the uniform penny postageact in 1839 all postage charges werepaid in cash (usually on delivery)' involving an enormous amount of bookkeeping on the part of the postoffice,which would have been increased ahundred-fold when the reduced ratesof postage came into force, but thesuggestion of the great postal reformer for "a bit of paper, just largeenough to bear the stamp, and coated on the back with a glutinouswash," being subsequently embodiedin the famous one penny black postage label and its consort, the twopence blue, which made their debut inMay, 1840, and were the progenitorsof all adhesive postage stamps.For three short years Great Britainenjoyed a monopoly of the novel andhandy method of collecting postages,until, in July, 1843, the enlightenedEmpire of Brazil followed suit with aseries of unprepossessing adhesive labels of native manufacture, adornedwith large numerals of value in placeof a design. In 1847 the United Statesentered the field with two beautifullyengraved portraits of Franklin andWashington, while the head of Ceres,the Goddess of Agriculture, foundplace on the first stamps of theFrench Republic, engraved by theelder Barre, which made their debuton January 1, 1849.

Often a dress ofcheaper material will be of greatersatisfaction because of its well-launderedcrispness than a more expensive frock. Lawn, swiss, linen andratine are charming made up in asimple, stylish mannee, and, if wornwhen fresh and crisp from the ironing table, will give the wearer asdainty an appearance as milady in expensive silks and chiffons, who maywear a gown but once and lay it asideforever.It is a foregone conclusion thatwomen are dainty, and if daintiness islacking so is feminine charm.Sloie,kf-H fL. 4?

So Mother's tunics have .become double skirts for 'the littledaughter and the waiscoats have given a wiastcoat effect to pointed vestsin children's dresses.For the small boy the Dutch andiOliver Twist suits are having a greatvogue. Trousers of blue, green orbrown, and buttoned to waists ofwhite, liaving collars and cuffs tomatch the trousers, are distinctly boyish and quite a change from the irompers, which have been the accepted every-day suit for the small boy solong. A Florence Dbmbey dress forthe little, girl corresponds to thisboy's suit. The short, circular skirtis buttoned with large pearl buttonsto a blouse of white. It is very cunning, but more becoming to the girlof eight than to her younger sister;while the boy's suits are more becoming to the real small boy.The small. boy's suit for wear onstate occasions should be of . , white,pique or linen. If he is sinall "tirecollars and cuffs may be embroidered,but as he grows older the plainerand more tailored must the suit appear. For the boys and girls alike theBalmacaan coat is smartest for everyday wear and should be in everyward robe made of some rainproofmaterial to take the place of the rubber coat in rainy weather. Capes forthe girl are coming in upon the highwave just in the wake of mother'scape, and moret han likely the smartest winter coats will be those havinga cape of the same material attached.Now is the time for a timely talkon feet. Gone is the old prejudiceagainst large feet. Athletics helpedto lessen it.and dancing has reachedthe pople that athletics didn't touch.In order to dance .the new dancesgracefully the feet must be comfortable. Many have tried to launch thedancing slipper without heels, on theballet variety, but except among avery few this has not been successful..But heels are lower and toes arebroader throughout the whole shoerealm.Colored uppers to shoes, or coloredstockings with low shoes, are quitethe expected mode. The low shoesalso have colored uppers and backsin cafe au lait (the color of coffee andmilk), or biscuit. These are mountedwell down into the vamp and run tothe sole at the sides, and make thefeet look as small as possible.w-vk i-t-f Iielephoneand Telegraph CompanyINCORPORATED.0mOLLTCODDLE" LAXATIVESCmIWiUDi Nit ThcI tkc UverThmr'BMkr lr out tie intestinal tract,fevt 4osot relieve the dammed-up bile.Yrs Kay Apple Boot (called PoAopfcyllia) was a last-resort bile starter.It griped fearfully, but brought out theMe.

The simple waist has thebody and sleeves in one, with a large,rounding collar of the same lawn. Achemisette of white organdy, withflaring ocllar,. completes the waist.The skirt is plain, except that it iscaught up to simulate a bustle, givesa quaint and old-time effect to theI dress. -Behold! from inexpensive materials and simple embellishment wehave a charming costume which iseasily made and easily kept fresh.The long tunic skirt has taken thecountry by storm. So sudden and unexpected has been its popularity thatthe shops have been unprepared for Iit. The manager of a well-knownshop, where only ready-made suitsand costumes are sold, said that if thefurore had come any earlier than itdid it would put them out of business. The suit of my second illustrationhas the long tunic skirt, and simplejacket of cadet-blue ratine. It is madeof the one material throughout, whichmakes it stand alone in the crowd ofsuits and dresses where combinationsof colors and fabrics are the keynotesA variety of fabrics are being usedfor children's frocks. Among thtemis crepe, which makes charming little dresses that have an added attraction in that ironing is required tomake them presentable. After theyare washed, Jf they are wrung andpulled and smoothed into shape, theyare ready to, put o as soon as theyare dry.For play dresses and rompers, select the heavy, firm quality. It iscalled English or Japanese crepe, andcomes in a number of alluring colors,such as Dutch blue, buff, odd pink andgreens. These will be found serviceable and are usually made into littlefrocks which hang from the shouldersandv are belted with a wide belt, orsash, of the same or contrastingcolor.For every-day afternoon dressesplisse crepe may be used. Thiscomes in quaint and old-time designs,especially cunning when made upwith long waists and short, fluffyskirts. A two-inch strip of the material may be corded on either edge,and used for the connecting belt ofskirt and waist. iVoile and net take first place forthe little girl's best dress this summer. These are usually worn overslips of pink or blue wash silk. Evenfor the tiny girl net is used, slightlycoraed. and braided, tucked and embroidered.

KfiNTliCK JUNE 23 1914PARCEL POST QUESTIONArgument Against Increasing WeightLimit Beyond Fifty Pounds.The Evansville, Ind,. Courier, May7, 1914.To the Editor of the Courier:Your editorial in Saturday's issue,April IS, under the heading of "Parcels Post and Express Companies,"lias- my attention.The undertaking by the postofficedepartment of the general government to transport parcels withoutweight limit, or, if limited to fiftypounds, is a great economic problemnot easy of solution .The question is asked, "would it bea calamity to have a wasteful and expensive agency driven out of businessby a more economical one?" "Wouldit be disastrous for business to haveproducts moved more cheaply?" Thisdisposes of the matter in a very summary way. But where the logic ?Thestatement is an implication that postoffice department can do this parcelspost business more cheaply than theexpress companies. But no argumentis adduced to prove it. That the government produces anything or performs any service for the publiccheaper than individuals or privatecorporations is open to grave doubts.The express companies are now under the supervision of the interstatecommerce commission.This is a department of the generalgovernment created by law to reguTate transportation. Is it fair to theexpress companies for another department of the government to enter intothe same kind of transportation business at a lesser rate than that approved by the interstate commercecommission for these companies?To my mind this is a sane question.These companies have vested interests and the government should undertake to protect these interests,rather than to destroy them. If it beargued that these express companieshave full right to enter jnto competition with the government's rate, itmay easily be assumed that thesecompanies will gladly undertake to do.this, if the postoffice department shallmake a rate that will cover all coststor service, including such interest onthe cost of the vast equipment devoted to this service, as the InterstateCommerce Commission shall decide-these companies are entitled to onheir invested capital.These companies have been taxedfor these government owned postoffices and equipment used in this transportation service, and it does notseem fair to them that the power ofthe government through the postofficedepartment should be used for theiroverthrow.Furthermore, the people otherthan, those who make use of thistransportation service have a rightto a voice in this matter and to demurto taxation to make up for losses incurred on this scheme of transportation. Moreover the patrons of the serviceliave no right to, nor are they demanding a rate that shall not be commensurate with the service renderedand that shall fully compensate thegovernment.When it is understood that the novernment does not operate the postoffice department for profit, andassuming that the department canperform this service as eheaply as theexpress companies can, then it isclearly evident that the express companies cannot maintain themselves inthis unequal contest; for they musthave a profit if they are to remainin business.The only hope open to the companies now is that their patrons will inconsideration of better service thanoffered by the government and .theindemnity feature of the service, bewilling to pay such rate as the Interstate Commerce Commission shall decide they are entitled to.I am informed by one of the localcompanies that scarcely more thantwenty-five per cent, of incoming andoutgoing freight weights over fiftypounds. Much of this weight of fiftypounds or less could be as well transported bv the parcels post, and if atan arbitrary price fixed by law, lessthan the express companies can affordto carrv, then we may logicany conclude tiiat it will go that way; thenif later on the weight limit is extended to one hundred pounds, there willbe little left for the express companies to do; so little in fact that thebusiness would not be remunerative.If it is the settled policy of thegovernment to extend the parcels postfacilities, then it will need the samefacilities that the express companiesnow have in service.Whv not then take over these facilities rather than to duplicate themand thus save the great los that mustnecessarily follow if forced out oflousinessIt occurs to me that it would- beinst p. unfair to these companies tofnroo tiipm out of businesspower of general government and atthe expense of the people, as it wouldto the railroads to build parallel linesthroughout the country by taxing thepeople, and then by law make ratesthat would put the railroads out ofbusinecs.Means for the speedy and cheaptransportation of small parcels to every part of the country is a publicnecessity. Where such means do notnow exist or are insufficient the government may properly supply them.But where the government can giveneither better nor cheaper servicethan the agencies now provide, ruinous competition is unjustifiable.Bv cheaper service is meant ser-vice at no more wsi - "- ---BUCKWHITETANc:EZ3at a lesser cost than theagencies.There is another feature of thisparcels post service that may wellhave the- thoughtful consideration ofall of our people; for it threatens apartial if not complete revolution ofexisting commercial relations.The year 1913 saw an extension ofthe mail order business of the country of not less than twenty milliondollars. Probably much more. Andthe parcels post contributed largelyto this enormous business. As thesemail order houses are located in thelargest cities of the country, it transfers this immense traffic from morethan two thousand country stores doing business in excess of ten thousanddollars. Furthermore it diverts thesame business from the ordinarychannels of distribution through thejobber, to these same retail storesnow located in every jobbing centerthroughout the country.If the government is fully compensated for the cost of this service andin addition a margin of profit sufficient to suitably reward private capitalengaged in a like carrying business,and it is then found to be an economicfactor in distribution, it would seemthat the revolution or evolutionshould go on.If, however, the government performs this service as a whole or evnin part, at the expense of the people,then" what? Is anybody wronged ifby the extension of this service thepresent channels of distribution aredisrupted and jobbers and retailersalike are driven out of business as arethe express companies being drivenout now?This is an economic question ofsuch import, that it should demandthe serious consideration of everystudent of economics in the country.And for the present I believe thePostmaster General should wait anyfurther extension of the weight limit,until he can be sure that the department can demonstrate its ability toproperly and economically care forthe business that will come to it under his recent orders.BRYON PARSONS.existing t"THE GOOD OLD DAYS"HAD THEIR DRAWBACKS.LITTLE NONSENSE NOWAND THEN GOOD FORUS."Into each life some rain must fall,"but don't get it into your head thatevery little shower is a cloud burst.There is nothing made by turningcorners too sharply.Pay your taxes, but see to it thatthe money is wisely and economicallyexpended.

Mr. Ballis a young man with brilliant prospects, and most excellent habits, andhis bride is said to be an accomplished and attractive young lady.Mrs. Belle Vimont Armstrong,aged about 60, died early Saturdaymorning at St. Vincents Hospital, Indianapolis, as the result of a secondoperation. Mrs. Armstrong has beenin failing health for several months.Early in April she underwent a serious operation from which she receivedno good results. About a week agoit was decided by her physicians thatanother operation was necessary.This was performed, and conditionswere found to be more serious than inthe first operation. She did not rallyfrom the shock of the second, andcontinued to grow worse until the endcame. Mrs. Armstrong was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Lewis Vimont, ofthis place, and the greater part of herlife has been spent here. She wasone of nine children, and is survivedby two brothers T. A. Vimont, ofParis, and Banks Vimont, of Lexington; four sisters, Mesdames Brady, ofCarlisle, Harrison, of Lexington,Myers, of Bowling Green, and Bean,of Nashvillle, Tenn. She was unitedwhen a young woman in marriage toMr. Robert Armstrong, and their marriage was blessed with one daughter,Miss Mary Armstrong, who survivesher mother, Mr. Armstrong havingdied several years ago. Mrs. Armstrong was one of our most popularf ladies, and was loved by all who knewher. She was a member of the Methodist Church, and a devoted mother.Some years ago Miss Mary Armstrong"secured a position as instructor in music at Hamilton College, Lexington,her mother going with her at thetime. Mrs. Armstrong and daughterhave passed since then considerabletime at Lexington. Where the daughter secured a position the mother wasalways with her. The devotion between mother and daughter was indeed remarkable, and has been commented upon by friends. About twoyears ago Miss Armstrong secured aposition in Indianapolis, Ind., wherethey have since resided. The remains,accompanied by Miss Armstrong, andother relatives, arrived here Sundayat noon, and were taken to the vault,where they were laid until 10:30 a. m.Monday. After a short funeral service at the grave by Rev. J. D. Reddand Dr. C. C. Fisher, they were laidto rest in the Millersburg cemetery.One of the prettiest, as well asthe most elaborate, receptions of theseason was that given by Mrs. W.
