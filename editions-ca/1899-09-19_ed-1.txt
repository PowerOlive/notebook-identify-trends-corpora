andAdheres to FranchiseLondon Sept 18 The reply of thTransvaal government to Mr Chamberlains latest note is said to covernine pages It is eminently of thenegative and inconclusive characterwhich Mr Chamberlain declaredwould compel the imperial governmentto consider the situation afresh Itpractically repudiates suzerainty reverts to the seven years franchise anddeelines to give equality to the Dutchand English languages in the volksraad In short it is politely negativeand defiant The full text may not beavailable for a day or two but it willnot change the aspect of affairs Thecabinet will probably meet on Wednesday or Thursday to consider the nextstepThe Morning Post saysThe Boers mean to fight That isthe plain English of itThe Standard saysThe Transvaal note is unsatisfactory and indeed a dangerous composition It might be going too far to saythat the last hope of peace has vanished or that diplomacy has said itsfinal word but it is idle to deny thatthe rulers of the Transvaal havebrought their country very close tothe brink of disaster which the Britishgovernment done its best to avertThe Daily Chronicle says We regret that the Boers by rejecting a fairoffer made in fair language havetaken a line giving fresh points to theargument of their enemies that President Krugeris a shifty and impracticable politician fit only to be spoken toacross a line of bayonetsThe

and so directedthe light that its glare passed downwardsand up to the entrance of the stables leaving the sides of the stables in darkness although my own room was bright enoughThs was a precautionary measure as itwould discover anyone attempting to comein by the stable entrance which Lad nodoor and would enable me at any time tosee to rush down quickly to the aid oJaropo should he need it I debated a shortwhile as to whether I should undress for thenight but so little did 1 like the looks of theplace which was more like a house oi callfor bravos than anything I had seen that 1did nothing beyond removing my boots andflinging myself as 1 was on the viletruekle bed in the room I placed undrawn word at my side and soughtto sieep struggling resolutely to getthis desipte the legions of inhabitantsthe bed contained who with one accord sallied forth to least upon me But sleep I wasdetermined to have as J had work tor tomorrow and knowing Jacopo to own sharpeyes and quick ears felt no scruple aboutgetting my rest determining however tomake it np the next day to my knave for hisvigil which I was sure would be faithfullykept Finally despite the attacks of myenemies I dropped oil into a light slumberwhich lasted for two or three hours when1 was startled by hearing a shrill whistle theclash of swords the kicking and plunging ofihe horses and Jacopos voice shouting outmy name 1 woke up at once with all mywits about me and on the instant ran downthe ladder sword in hand parrying more byaccident than design a cut that was made atme by some one as 1 descendedAs I touched the ground two men dartedout of the door and ran across the hallruined yard in front of the stables A thirdwhom 1 recognized as Jacopo was about tofollow but 1 held him back by the shoulder having no mind to run risks arounddark corners whilst I had my letter to deliver Jacopo yielded to me very unwillingly and in an answer to my hurried inquirygave me an account of the affair which hadbeen as brief as it was noisvWhen your worship retired said heleaving the lanthorn to so convenientlylight up the stable entrance I had anotherJook at the horses and then settled myselfdown on that heap of straw yonder my backto the wall and my sword in my right handSo an boor or may be two passed and thenI heard voees outside and some one swearing at the light Oh ho says I to myselftheres a night hawk about and 1 remainedon the alert not thinking it worth while togive tongue then After awhile the voicesdropped away and excellency I am sorrybut I must have slipped off into a doze andbeshrew me if 1 did not dream 1 wasaboard that cursed ship again and beingmade to play pea-in-the-drum once more Itherefore made haste to awaken and as Iopened my eyes heard a crackling noise outtide I rose slowly and crept towards theentrance and just as I reached within threefeet of it a handful of pebbles was thrownin and one of the horses started a bit Thestones were clearly flung from outside to seeif anyone was awake but of course I madeno sipn and the next minute two men appeared at the open entrance 1 rave a whistle to roue your honor and went at them atonce and your excellency knows the restIn the morning my henchman was anxiousto know if I meant to take any steps withregard to the attempt at robbery last nightI was well enough inclined but determinedto let the matter rest until my business wasdone and for the present said I would remain content with the satisfaction that wehad saved our steeds and throats By thetime I linished breakfast Jacopo who hadalready taken a meal had saddled the horsesand was holding them ready for our departure 1 summoned mine host but at firstcould obtain no view of him Finally on mythreat to depart without settling my snorehe appeared with his arm bound up in asling As he was unwounded the eveningbeloie I made no doubt but that he wasone of the two who had visited us last nightiut said nothing nvjrely remarking as 1paid my account that the love of horse Itafafrequently brought people inlo trouble Hedid not seem to appreciate the rem irk andscowled at me at which 1 bade him begoneand to thank his stars that his house wasnot pulled about his ear lie did ntt attempt any reply but slunk off and inwardly resohing to dear out this neat of scorpions from Rome at the first chance 1 rodeout of ths gate followed by Jacopo and wedirected oar way towards the Pont S Anueio 1 had not the least idea where hiseminence of IUuut was stymg but madecertain it would be somewhere in the BorgOami that one 1 bad tea hd the papal quarter I should find no difficulty in my searchfor DAmboisc and in delivering to himMachiavellis letterAs I went on I began to feel nervous intpite of mv4f M to what the results of myinterview with the cardinal would be anoV hether h would end in the further employwhich the secretary had distmctlymentid t weald 1 had reason to doubtTHE BOURBON NEWS PARIS KY TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 19 1899however and it was with a hopeful mindthat 1 trotted up the Lungo TavereNear the statues of Peter nd Paul on thebridge was a guardhouse occupied at thetime by a detachment of Spanish infantryand to these men I addressed myself inquiring where the cardinal of Rouen was stayingI was told at once that hife eminence waslodging in the new palace of Cardinal Cortieto opposite the Scorsa Cavalli and thatmy best way was to turn to the left on crossing the bridge and then to the right at thejunction of the Borgo San Spirito and theBorgo San MicheleBestowing my thanks and a largesse onthe men for their kindness I went on at agallop congratulating myself on the easewith which the difficulty was solved and ina few minutes had crossed the Piazza ScorsaCavalli and was before the residence of thecardinal At the time 1 speak of it was notquite finished but still habitable and hadbeen rented by Monsignore dAmboise asbeing conveniently near the VaticanOn entering the courtyard 1 dismountedand giving my horse to Jacopo to hold ascended the steps and boldly announced myself as an urgent messenger who had business with his eminence I was ushered by apage into 0 reception room and early as thehour was there were a considerable numberof people already in attendance awaitingthe morning levee Here I was left to coolmy heels for a little time the spruce pageinforming me that the cardinal was engagedat breakfast but that he would tell him ofmy coming and asked my name I hesitatedior a moment but decided to keep the nameof Donati which 1 had assumed and gavethat adding that I was the bearer of anurgent dispatch to the cardinal which Imust deliver with my own hands Theyoung man then left me as I have said andtaking a good position near the entrancedoor to the adjoining room I leaned backagainst the wall and awaited my summonsThe reception room was of noble proportions oblong in shape the ceiling being supported by two pillars of veined marblewhich although they diminished 1he sizeof the chamber had a good effect The marble flooring arranged in a patchwork ofblack and white was bare of all furnitureand as the room gradually filled the constant moving of feet the sound of whichrang sharply on the stone made it appearas if a lot of masons hammers were at workI let my eyes wander over the groups asthey stood or moved about wondering if bychance I should see anyone I knew butthey were all strangers to me mostly Frenchmen with a lair sprinkling of priestsamongst them They were one and all trying to jostle past each other so as to gainas close a position as possible to the entrancedoor near to which 1 stood and as Iwatched tiiis with some little amusementI heard a whisper in my ear and glancinground beheld a man standing near me in adoctors robe holding a heavily bound missal in his hand 1 saw in a moment it wasCorte and he whispered in a low voiceDo not look round at present but nearthe pillar to your right are two men onedressed half in cloth of gold and they aremore interested in you than you think 1overheard a snatch of conversation theyare moving this way By your leave signore raising his voic he attempted topush by me and catching the hint his lastwords had thrown out I answered loudlyFirst come first served learned doctorand you must bide your turnI am a man of peace and thereforeyield Corte moved off and I was free tolook w round me I saw that Cortes littlepiece of acting to which 1 had risen wasdue to the fa t that the man in the clothof gold and his companion were edging nearer to us and at the time were barely six feetoil Besting my hand lightly on the hilt ofmy sword I looked the two full in the facebut could make nothing of them The onewho wore a jerkin of gold cloth met my lookfor an instant and then dropped his eyes afaint flush rising to his cheek 1 saw that hewas a young man of a singularly handsomecountenance A short neatly curled mustache fell over his upper lip and mouth butthere was no sign of a beard on the smalland rounded chin which was cleanly sha enOn his right cheek he wore a black patchplaced as if to hide the scar of a wound although his complexion was as delicate as ifthe sun had never touched it In his earshe wore earrings an affectation of femaleadornment hateful to me and the fingers ofhis small right hand which he held ungloved were covered with rings The hiltof his rapier too peeping from under thefolds of his gay cloak was crested with jewels and altogether it seemed as if I couldhave nothing to fear from this painted lilywho looKed more fitted to thrum a lute in aladys bower than have aught to do with thestir of the times 1 therefore loosed myglance from him with some contempt andturned to his companion who was robed asan abbe and evidently in a sour middle ageHis features were bolder than those of hiscompanion but distinctly those of thecanaille and there was nothing in them inany way remarkableNevertheless I thought it well to be onthe watch knowing that a dagger thrust iseasily sent home and there was the certainty too that the fact of my coining toHome with a letter was known to the Mediciplotters in Florence and evidently it wastheir object to frustrate its delivery Whatpuzzled me however was that the look theyoung man directed to me was not unfriendly and it struck me that if I could only hearhis voice it might give me some clew to a recognition The two had come a little betweenma and the door and I was just about tocontest the place with a view of forcing theirhands if possible when the door was flungopen and the same page who had taken myname appeared and called outSignor Donati his eminence awaits youAs the door opened there was a generalmovement towards it But the cry of thepage in a moment arrested the crowd turning the look of anticipation on the faces ofall to one of disappointment and a loudmurmuring arose against my beimt so favored I lost not a second in stepping forward and in doing so purposely brushedagainst the young man near to me turninground as I did so with a somewhat brusqueBy your leave sir 1 full expected thathe would resent my rudeness and makesome speech but he merely bowed his headwith inclinn t inn slinwincr 11 sptv w m m - ww wcof small and even teeth as he smiled underi his blond mustache I was a little put outby the failure of my plan but the next in-stant the door closed behind me and at anylate the letter to the cardinal was safe andmy task was as good as accomplished1 followed the page tfcereiore with anequal mind and lifting a curtain which fellin heavy folds at the end of the passagewhere a couple of gorgeous lackeys stood hecalled out Messer Donati an J thenstepped aside to let me pass I entered theroom with a firm step and saw before me alarge but plainly furnished apartment Ina lounge chair near a small table on whichwas set out a light repast was a man whom1 at once guessed to be the cardinal Hewore a purple robe and the barettina orsmall skull cap which covered the tonsureon his head allowed his short gray hairwhich curled naturally to be seen around itUnder the cap I saw a square resolute facewith keen black eyes and a full but kindlymouth He was just putting down a glassof vernaccia a9 I came in and I caught thepurple glitter of the Bapphire ring he worein token of his rank as he set down the glassHe was not alone for leaning against thewindow and caressing the head of an enormous wolf hound was a splendidly dressedcavalier who looked up as I came in and Isaw at once it was Bayard 1 kept my eyesaway from him however and advancingstraight towards the cardinal placed the letter before him without a wordDAmboise looked at the seals carefullyand then taking a small jade hilted knifefrom the table ripped open the envelope andran his eye quickly over the letter As hedid so not a muscle of his face moved to showhow the contents stirred him and when hehad finished he held it out at arms lengthsayingMv dear Bayard what do you think ofthisBayard made a step forward to take theletter and in doing this our eTes met andhe frankly held out his hand I could hardly believe it when I saw it extended towardsme My breath came thick and fast and thewhole room swam around The man was thesoul of honor the noblest knight in Christendom he had seen my trial nay he had beenone of my judges and he offered me hishand He must hold me guiltless 1 feltMy lord I rather gasped than spoke as1 took his grasp but seeing my emotion heput inSit down cavaliere His eminence willforgive me for disposing of a seat in his housewe are more than old friends He placedhis hand on my shoulder and forced me to aseat whilst DAmboise still holding theletter in his hand looked at us with a puzzled airSt Dennis he exclaimed What doesthis mean BayardIt means your eminence that this is agallant gentleman who has been most baselyused but pardon me the letterHe took the letter from the cardinalshands and read it quickly whilst I sat stillwith emotions in my heart I cannot describeand DAmboise glanced from one to anotherwith a half amused half curious look on hiskeen face Bayard finished his perusal in afew seconds and laying the letter on thetable said Nothing could be better Weshould be prepared for action althoughthere is yet plenty of time I wonder how inthe world the Florentine got wind of thisOh he has long ears We shall howeverwant a good sword and if all that the secretary writes is true we have got it in yourfriend the Cavaliere Donati In fact Machiavelli suggests him for the taskMy n une jour eminence is not DonatiI here put in but Savelli When misfortune overtook me I changed my name butI see no reason for hiding the truth fromyouQuite right said DAmboise but Savelli Is this the Savelli of the Arezzo affair BayardBayard nodded assent and the cardinalcontinued turning to me Then sir I haveheard jour storj and you have more friendsthan you think But of this later on Wereyou not at FornovoYes i replied wondering what the cardinals speech meantCiel I made out jour patent of St Lazare mvself What could have madeSklJ 1I placed the letter beiore him without a wordmouille act as he did I do not know and heis as obscinate as a mule Bayard I know allabout this gentleman and your testimonyto his worth convinces me that what I haveheard is correct I could never believe thestory myselfMy lords you may doubt but theworldWill yet come round to you cavalieresaid Bayard and added Your eminencecould not have a better sword for your purpose than that of M di Savelli here provided he will accept the taskI will accept anything from you mylords I saidGood said DAmboise now let metell you how you stand Acting doubtlesson the advice of friends Mine dEntrangueswrote to me a full account of the affairwhich ended so badly for you and explainedfully her husbands treachery This shebegged me to forward to Tremouillo with aview of getting your sentence altered Asyou have just been made aware I have someknowledge of you and it was a thousandpities to see a sword which had servedFrance well turned away I laid the matterbefore the duke but he replied to say hecould take no action The duchess who ismy cousin has also used her influence butto no purpose for Tremouille stirs his porridge with his own hand and does not careif it burn or not as long as he Stirs it himself We could get the kings pardon foryou and as a last resource that might bedone for I like as littla to be thwarted asHis Grace of Tremouille but that will raiseyou up a strong enemy in the duke and itwill not kill the you seeT do j our eminence How can I thankyouI do not want jour thanks cavaliere butFrance wants vour sword our only wayis to do a signal service for France and afterthis the matter is easy Tremouille is generous and it would want but a little pressureto make him rescind his sentence apparentljof his own accord provided you could dowhat 1 have said Strange how fate works1 remamed silent and DAmboise wenton Sku h a service it is possible for you todo and I will put it in your way I cannotat present give you details as they have tobe discushed with the secretary who willshortly be in Borne This much however Ican tell you get together a lew good menyou doubtless can lay your hands on themand be ready You will no doubt want fundsbut they will be arranged for In the meantime you may consider yourself as attachedto my suite a moment he continued as1 was about to pour out my thanks you hadbetter for the present call yourself Donati1 know something of the history of Romanfamilies and your name would not smeliwell to the Chigi and Colonna and remember the Tiber is very deepHe touched a small handbell as he concluded and the page appeared Defaurehe said send the Abbe Le Gere dgentlemen to me after that you will pleaseinform the steward that apartments are tobe prepared at once for M Donati who ishere The page bowed and vanished andas I rose to await the coming of the suite thecardinal went on with a smile Messieursin the anteroom are doubtless getting impatient we must make haste to receivethem As he said these words a grayhaired priest entered bearing on a cushionthe scarlet hat of a prince of the church andfollowing him half a dozen gentlemen andgrooms of the chamber The cardinal roseand leaning on the arm of Bayard walkedslowly towards the door Le Clerc bore thehat immediately before him and the rest ofus formed a queue behind As we came tothe door it was flung open by two lackeys ina blue and silver livery who shouted outMy Lord Cardinal waj wayWe passed into the room where the people were arranged in two rows and DAruboise walked down the line bowing to oneexchanging a word or two with another until he came opposite Corte The doctordropped to his knee and presenting hisbook solicited the cardinals influence toobtain from him an audience with the popeto whom he desired to dedicate his workPerte said the cardinal Why not goto his eminence of Strigonia books aremore in his line than well we shall seewo shall seeHe passed on and the next group thatcaught his eye was that of the young strange1in the cloth of gold and his companionAs the cardinal approached the joungman drew a letter from his vest and presented it with a low bowDAmboise tore it open and glanced overthe contents Diable he exclaimedfrom Mine de la Tremouille herself Seehere Bayard the duchess writes introducing her iriend the Chevaliere St ArmandeI know not the houseWe are of Picardy your eminenceThe voice was singularly sweet and softand a strange and undefinable resemblancein its tones to some other voice I had heardstruck me but J could not fix upon anjthingThe duchess says you are anxious toserve would it not have been easier to sendyou to the dukeSt Armande looked round with a heightened color and then replied speaking in thesame low soft tonesIf your eminence will kindly read theletter you will perceive that my desire wasto see something of the court of Bome beforejoining the dukeDAmboise glanced at tiie letter againand an odd smile passed over his faceI see he added the postscript Mydear chevalier Mine de la Tremoilles requests are commands to me If you will dorne the honor of joining my suite I shall bedelighted Permit me to introduce you tothe Cavaliere Donati who is also a newfriendI bowed and extended my hand and StArmande placed his within mine It wassmall and delicate as a

mere watch of a dogEnglish PaperFAIR FACESfor a soldier and his mother was ather early home in Indiana but Grandpa and Grandma Hogan were at theirsod house on the North Fork 11 milesdistant The children had come fromthere that morningWhen first seen at about sevenoclock they were sitting in front ofthe treasurers home on a rude sledharnessed to a very subdued piebaldcaynse or Indian pony Ilow long theyhad been there wns not clear they appeared to be waiting to be seen notheard It was a cold morning whileyet six inches of frozen snow lay on theground and their clothing was farfrom warm or abundant They hadwrapped themselves in three worn oldblankets and had a large rickety goodsbox at their backs Rose was sittingstraight as a stick her black eyes fixedon the house windows she scarcelyspoke at all and declined to go into thehouse after the treasurer had invitedthem to enter but watched his faceclosely It was the boy who did thetalking He said that they had cometo get the bounty so that they couldgo to the store and buy grub stuffBounty on what the treasurerasked themWolf ses said the boy Five wolf sesand a lion and a kiyoteBut have you the proofs the hidesor scalps with the tails the treasureraskedYep replied the boy in a businesstone Jumping nimbly over the goodsbox he hauled out from it five wolfpelts a coyote hide and a small mountain lion skin all freshThe wolf skins were those of thelarge gray timber wolf a formidableand destructive brute which inflicts deplorable losses on the stockmen of thecounties west of the Missouri bordering the Black hills The new bountylaw provides that three dollars shall bepaid by county treasurers for each graywolf scalp or hide a like sum for amountain ion and one dollar for acoyoteBut satisfactory evidence must bepresented that the animals were killedwithin the county or state and it is thetreasurers duty on payment to puncha hole cot less than half an inch indiameter in each ear of every skin toprevent repeating The skin thusmarked is returned to the person presenting it who can sell it if he wishesIt is expected also that the owners ofcattle and cheep ranches will pay abounty to those who destroy wolves andpanthers in addition to that paid bythe stateTo prevent fraud the county officersare obliged to use vigilance and in thisinstance the treasurers suspicion wasthat the children had been sent to himby some one who had brought the skinsinto the state from Nebraska or WyomingWhere did you get these hides heaskedOffn wolfses replied the ladYes but who killed themThe bovs eves searched the treasurerV Grandpa Hogan made pilisfer em he replied as if concedingsomething unwillingly but her andme ketched em he added stoutly indicating his companion with a nodHow old a man is your grandfather the treasurer asked incredulouslyHes most 80 grandpa is and it tookhim mo t all the forenoon every timeto get to skin emLook here you must tell me thetruth about this said the treasurerseverelyIm telling you the truth repliedthe boy with clear eyed honestyHer and me ketched em and grandparnade pills fer em fer usBut tail me how you caught thesewolves I exclaimed the treasurer stillunoeniincdWe kstched em in the shackWhat shack WhereGrandpas old shack where h usedto live on tother side of the crickYes but how did j ou catch wolvesin this shack questioned the treasurer How came the wolves in theshackThey went in to get the hoss headand the steer bonesBones that you put there for baitBut what kept the wolves from comingoutThe boy explained that her meaning Rose whose black eyes blinkedrapidly when the treasurer looked ather had made a kind of spring catchfrom ash wood and a leather stringattached to which was a stone for aweight The door of the shack or smalllog shanty was left ajar about teninches so that a wolf lion or anyother creature approaching the emptystructure could put its head in and lookabout the interiorTo all appearance the door was unfastened swinging free and the wolfor other wild beast was not alarmedby anything that it saw either within orwithout To get the bones it had butto walk in yet when it did so the larger part of its body pushed the door backa little farther and the ashen springat the top bending slightly releasedthe weight attached to the springThen as the creatures body passed inthe door was pulled to with jusst sufficient force to latch it The animal wasthus entrapped and all so quietly thatit scarcely felt any alarm at firstIlow the girl had learned so cunninga stratagem was not explained perhapsfrom her Indian mother There wasvery little to it of gear or mechanismand nothing whatever in the way ofmetal otherwise it would have failedsince it is now almost impossible to takethese wolves in steel traps or in logtraps such as white hunters sometimesconstructYet to this primitive device contrivedby the hand of an 11-year-old child fivelarge gray wolves had one after another fallen victims Two indeed hadbeen entrapped at once the second having apparently pushed into the shackwith the firstThe shack itself was simply a littlelow log house without windows andhaving a sod roof When once the doorhad swung to and latched behind thewolf it was a prisonerBy the time the boy had explained itand told how the spring and weightwere adjusted the treasurer becameconvinced of his truthfulness Hebrought out his punch and hammerand proceeded to make holes in the eavaof the skins as by law directed wild little Rose eyin his every movement withattention to detailsHow did you know when you hadcaught a wolf the treasurer askedHer went up to look every morningtaid the boyWhat did you do when you fomdyou had a wolf the treasurer askedthe girl but she only blinked half adozen times in a second and it was stillthe boy who replied for her that sheran home to get Grandpa Hogan tomake a pill for itThe old man had been a wolf hunterin his day and knew that to shoot awolf inside the shack would spoil allchance of trapping another there Heinclosed enough strychnine to kill awolf in a bit of tallow the size of ahens egg This the children carried tothe shack and poked In through a chinkbetween the logs and after they hadgone the wolfs hunger soon did therestToward evening the two small hunters were wont to return and in no casehad failed to find the wolf dead Theythen opened the door and attaching abit of rope to the animals hind legshauled it home in triumphAlthough too infirm to go abroad inthe snow the old man was able to skinthe wolves when brought to himThe treasurer paid the children thebounty money 19 in all and with anamused smile watched them drive tothe store to buy grub stuff of whichthe forlorn family was no doubt in needIt was likely that they would be able tosell the skins for as much more however and ile treasurer concluded thatthere was lo immediate cause for alarmconcerning the Foulkrods as long asthey had little Rose to trap for themand Custer to do the talking YouthsCompanionJnilRc
