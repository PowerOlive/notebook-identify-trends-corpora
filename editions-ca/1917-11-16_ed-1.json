Keep Your Kodak Busy!
"The Army lives on letters" is the way the boys at
front put it. And when those longed-for envelopes with
the home town postmark contain pictures of the home
folks and home doings they go far toward making lighter
hearts and happier faces.
Keep your Kodak busy for the sake of the lads in the
trenches, the boys in camp and on shipboard. Help keep
tight the bonds between the home and those who are
fighting for that home.
