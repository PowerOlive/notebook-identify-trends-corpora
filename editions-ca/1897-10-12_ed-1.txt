there were still no tidings ofthe missing inan and Donald Bartelsnever more icily calm began his unequal contest in the spirit of Travis atthe battle of the Alamo Of words hemust build his only bulwark talkingagainst time He began his address tothe jury with careful description of thelocations of the two mines describingwith minute particularity the Mascotlode its dip and trend the width between foot and hanging wall and thecharacter of its ore He waxed eloquent in the stor of Harvey Neilslong time of toil on the bleak hillsidethrough storm and sunshine summerand winter handicapped by povertyand even more by his boyish inexperience bravely keeping on even when attimes scarce so much as 1 slice of baconremained between him and starvationSo pathetic was his word picture of thisweary time of working and waitingthat a couple of mining men on the jurywho had perhaps suffered similar experiences in that same gambling gamewith nature were visibly affected theirfaces brightening sympathetically whe nthe speaker went on to tell of the richstrike which at last had promised metereward for all that had gone beforeSkillfully the clever speaker skimmedthe surface of the troublous times withthe miners afterward paying shrewdtribute to the avowed aims of the unionwhile at the same time delicately upholding the man who would not discharge a faithful and efficient workman at the behest of any man preferring to run the gauntlet of recrimination and enmity rather than be recreantto his conception of an employers dutysummarizing the whole matter as merely an unfortunate misunderstanding-which in retrospect should beSSggsSSSlJy creditable to both sidesrom this he went on to show how theMascot vein had developed an richnesswith depth until envy had castits evil eye upon a neighbors prosperity showing how the Grubstake mine had been relocated thetrend of its side lines so changedthat a larger section of the Mascotsrich territory miight be covered by theintersection of the two lodes if itcould be said that there were two lodesFor he would undertake to prove thespeaker went on to declare that neverhad any mineral been discovered in thisso called Grubstake lode until after thisrelocation tihey would show that thepresent management of the Grubstakemine mining men of acknowledgedskill and experience had sunk a shaftupon ground revealing no smallest veinof mineral ground utterly barren andexperiment of which the merest tyroin mining could scarcely be guiltjwithout tihe set purpose which becameapparent when from that unpromisingshaft a drift went creeping out to thewestward a drift which to the uninitiated must have seemed no less destitute of rational design than the workai the outset since it followed no leadthe method in which madness only becoming clear when that drift cut intoa tiny fault or fissure which had previously been uncovered in the Mascotlianging wall Then it was that theGrubstake claimed a true fissure veinjraking a turn at this point into theMascots rich ore body although eventhen they had not ventured to revealtheir purpose by cutting into theMascot workings preferring rather todelve in the wealth they had opened upbeyond where they might work undetected for the time They could showihat a man employed as foreman onthe Mascot at the time this small faultin the hanging wall was uncovered hadhad full direction of the Grubstakeworkings which led to the latter discovery so called a man influenced noless by personal enmity toward his lateemployer than through zeal for the manwho now paid him wage to do suchdirty work From this he went on toquote the decision of the supreme courtof the United States in the Amy-Silver--smithcase as determining the extralateral rights of the mine owner arguing that even if through ignoranceor willful blindness to the truth thisfault in the rock which constituted theGrubstakes only real claim to discovery could be considered a true vein itsdirection running as it did across theside lines of the Mascot effectuallybarred the Grubstake owner of anyextra lateral rights whatever in thatso called discovery In relocating theclaim plainly the intent had been tobring the richest portion of the Mascotterritory within the Grubstake sidelines but nature had been so inconsiderate as to put that little slip in thehanging wall just a few feet too fartoward the east and thus the Grubstake drift for obvious reason plannedto enter the Mascot territory at such a-workings had first come into groundso unexpectedly lean that the enterprising manager had been forced to go beyond -his side lines for the rich pickings he was after The speaker quotedfurther from the case of the Iron Silverversus the Elgin Mining company inwhich tihe supreme court had explicitlydeclared that if the locator does notmake the explorations necessary toascertain the true course of his veinand draws hU end lines ignorantly hemust bear the consequences Theowner of the Grubstake the speakerdeclared his voice vibrant with sarcasm had perhaps made the mistake ofhis life when he had failed to jump theMascot out and out but it was an instance of short sightedness almost unparalleled in the history of a gentlemanwhose peculiar methods had contribufted so much of the spice of variety tothe mining annals of Colorado Andfrom this he passed on to the mininghistory of the state to the first discoveries of the precious metals with aneloquent tribute to the hardy enduranceand courage of the pioneers citing several of the first rich strikes and slippingin a story in which everybody overlooked the irrevelance for the fun thatwas in it The mining conditions nextoccupied his attention in his zeal tomake all clear to the now somewhatrestless jury going back quite to thepalezotic age He quoted voluminouslyfrom Haydens survey he carefully explained the difference between thewater worn sedimentary rocks and thecrystalline structure of the igneousgoing on to describe the differing characteristics of the metamorphosed sedimentary rocks of the Cambrian Silurianand carboniferous series until the gaping jury first amazed at such show oerudition were presently yawning forsheer weariness Bight manfully heheld his ground until it appeared clearthat another word would make his caseforever abhorred in the minds of thasunhappy six resuming his seat at lastin complacent consciousness that itlacked but 12 minutes of four oclockWith the four witnesses at hand he feltsure of using up the remaining time before court adjourned while before nineoclock the next morning he felt thatsomething must be discovered of HarveyNeilThe first witness for the plaintiff wasthe surveyor who had made the originallocation for the Grubstake as well asthe Mascot lode He produced a notebook from which he read entries madein regard to the properties some tenyears before He thought the boundarylines of the Mascot as there enteredwere the same as appeared in the UnitedStates patent of a later date but it wTassome time before he appeared to beperfectly sure He mumbled in hisspeech and appeared to be on the vergeof mental wreck whenever a new question was put to him than which nothing could have been more satisfactory toDonald Bartels at the present junctureThe unhappy gentleman was encouraged to take his time and although MrCriley courteously waived the privilegeof cross examination fully 25 minuteshad been used up before a hatchet-faced man in mining -garb took1 hisplace upon the stand He had beenone of the original locators of theGrubstake claim and he ruefully explained how he and his partner hadconducted their unprofitable experiment under spiritual direction He related with sly appreciation of the entertainment he was affording that theyhad persevered in their work untilthey had not so much to live upon asthe smell of an oiled rag when hemade his partner a present of his sharein the old tunnel and pulled out Kbthey had never discovered any mineral to speak of he disgustedly declared they had struck a horse ofblack granite that was almost as hardas flint the first thing and in his opinion it went straight through the mountain at all events they had never seenthe end of it He had never minedunder spirit direction before or sinceit had been his partner who had gothim into that scrape and he grimlyaverred that he didnt want no moreof it in his to the great delight of theappreciative idlers in the back of theroom Mr Criley had a few questionsto ask of this witness but could elicitnothing tending to show that the Grubstake as originally located had developed anything even remotely suggesting the mineral of its present shipmentBut half an hour remained to be disposed of when the next witness took thechair a mining engineer and expertwhose reputation stood second to nonein the state He had carefully examined the Mascot mine its surface groundand workings and he would state thatit was unquestionably a true fissurevein with foot and hanging walls mostclearly defined He described the character of the country rock the widthbetween walls direction and dip of thevein demonstrating the character ofits ore by certain sxjeciniens whichafter objections on the part of MrCriley were given to the jury for examination He described the faultwhich occurred in the hanging wall ofthe mine explaining by what naturalagency it had been occasioned declaring very positively that he had beenable to discover no evidences whateverof any true vein intersecting the Mascot at this point Further under anorder from the court he had somemonths before made an examination ofthe Grubstake property finding thereno true lead except a small knife bladeseam which had been opened up inthe 130 foot level which was not in evidence in the present case The richore body claimed by the mine all laywithin the territory of the Mascot access thereto having been gained by following as a true lead the slip or faultin the Mascots hanging wall as aforesaid But although he had much tosay this gentleman spoke with a swiftdirectness that consumed little timeMr Criley proposed a few questions1o some of which Bartels interposedtechnical objectionsrthereby using upa few minutes in wordy controversy asto tbe lawiithecase while he furtherkeptf lie witness inhVfehftir tfor redirect examination until the judge leanedoyer his desk with a frown to protestagainst such useless repetition It nowlacked but 13 minutes of being fiveoclock however and it was with anair of buoja nt cheerfulness that Bartels called his last witness to the standSo far he felt the day was hisBut before three words liad beenspoken it was clear that this last witness an assayer from the local smelterfor some reason would rather have beenexcused He reluctantly admitted thathe had made assays from both the Mascot and the Grubstake ores He couldnot deny that they were similar incharacter but he did not rememberthat he had ever said that in his opinionthey came from the same vein He didnot know why he should have said anything like that it was understood atthe smelter that business was not tobe talked outside moreover he couldnot say now that he did think they hadcome from the same vein Ore from adjacent mines was eommonly quite similar As to whether the Grubstake hadbeen shipping high grade ore of late hecould not say only the superintendentof the smelter could tell that he keptrun of the lots that came in The witness had made most of the assays oflate but quite commonly the sampleshad been simply numbered so that hehad no means of knowing from whichmine they came Again Mr Crileysmilingly waived the privilege oE crossexamination and Bartels saw the witness leave the chair with a feeling thathis cause had gained nothing by this testimony beyond the consumption oftime But it was now six minutes beyond the regular hour of adjournmentand he felt measurably content as he addressed the court making a motion thatthe jury be taken through the workingsof both mines the next dajr a motionpromptty denied Each side in controversy his honor declared was at liberty to bring into court such mapsdrawings or other documentary evidence as might be thought necessaryto make clear- to the jury the points indispute but he saw no reason for wasting the time of the court in what wouldbe simply a day of junketing in themountainsAs Bartels had ceased to look for anyfavor from the court he was not surprised nor in any wise cast down aswith a reassuring glance at the clockhe resumed his seat But a surprise wTasIn the name ol heaven where have you boonphe criedin store for him as now the judge leanedover his desk again imperturbably gazing over the heads of the companywhile he deliberately announced thatowing to the pressure of other businessand the desirability of hastening thecase before the courtthey would not adjourn that evening until six oclockGentlemen you may go on with thecase he courteously added with anunseeing glance at BartelsThere was a murmur of exclamationin the back of the room and the clerkv ooden f aced and indifferent mechanically beat his gavel upon the table crying Silence in the court And thenhis face grown rather jrnle the attorneyfor the plaintiff arose and said If thecourt please on account of the absenceoi material witnesses I find myself unable to maintain the issues of this caseand am therefore compelled to submitto a voluntary non suit I will therefore move the court to dismiss this suitwithout prejudiceMr Criley was at once upon his feetdemanding that the court overrule thismotion and instruct the jury to find averdict for the defendant in view of thefact that no evidence had been producedin support of the allegations uponwhich that suit was brought but hishonor after examining the statuteswith evident reluctance stated that under the law the plaintiff was entitled toa non suit if he saw fit to take it Thecase was therefore dismissed at the costof the plaintiff but without prejudiceYou got out of that pretty well Bartels laughed Criley with an air ofbland condescension when five minuteslater they were going down the courthouse stairs Bather an awkward fixfor you too and a strange thing allaround having a client leave you in thelurch like that but perhaps you havesome theory to account for itNo returned Bartels curtly ostentatiously

blunt prow facingsouth and the captain reckoned he wassomewhere off the Queen Charlotteislands The Bear was an iron ship of- old fashioned build and as slow as theymake em any old thing on the ocean- could pass her yet pro tem she was apassenger boat and was bringing downjtfMhe last of the season s crop of I- y dike miners She was reputed to haveover 5000000 worth of gold dust andnuggets on board and her coming waswatched for with some anxietyOn the morning of the 7th the eaptain noticed on the western horizonwhat appeared to be a steamer comingtowards him As craft are scarce onthese waters except in the sealing season the captain watched the strangersapproach with interest not unmixedwith anxiety because of the valuablecargo he had aboard The sea wascalm for the time of year and thesteamer seemed to be making for acrossthe bows of the Bear The captain ordered the flag hoisted but the oncomershowed no answering colors which didnot tend to make the captain feel lessuneasy She was a trim craft lookinglike a private yacht painted black withtwo slim tapering masts set at a rakishslope in line with her one funnel Shecame swiftly through the water andturned her broadside toward the Russian Bear when the man at the wheelcalculated that she was as near as wassafe and her engines slowed down sothat the strangers speed more nearlyaccorded with the slow progress the- laT ger ship was making A man on thebridge came to the edge nearest theslower vessel and placing his hands tohis mouth shoutedShip ahoy Is that the RussianBearWho are you roared the captainand what do you want1 want an answer to my questionthen Ill tell you1 what more I wantAfter speaking however the newcomer did not wait for an answer butgave a command to the man at thewheel who promptly signaled for theengines to stop whereupon the yachtdropped to the rear notwithstandingthe slowness of the old Bear The namewas plainly painted on the stern andthe captain of the yacht having seenthat this was the ship he was aftermoved quickly alongside again thistime with only a couple of hundred feetof water between the two ships During the slight interval the crew of theyacht had been busr and now a forbidding looking cannon pointed itsominous inuzzle iowards the BearIm after the gold captain said thefirst speaker nonchalantly as nodoubt you are aware Im going to haveit quietly or Im going to sink -ourship Which is it to beWhatever gold we have on board ifwe1 haveauy isnt mine I dont seet what good the sinking of the ship willdo yoo and it would be very inconvenient to me Better sheer off and wellsay no more about it I can take a-joke hs well as the next manFor a time it looked as if the strangerheeded the good advice given him Thecaptain of the yacht rang full speedahead and the sharp prow cut the waterlike a knife The yacht described alarge circle and seemed to be showingvoir its paces but this as the captain ofhe Bear remarked was unnecessary-- Jfcr be -already kaew that any scow onthe Pacific could pass him However itwas soon evident thatthis was not theintention pf the enemy Banging alongside once more but this time furtheraway there was a cloud of smoke fromthe cannon a sharp report and thecrash of rending plates A jagged holebad been torn in the ships side near thebulwarks which while it did no harmscarcely improved the appearance of theBearOnce more the yacht swung aroundthe circle and again ranged alongsidewithin a distance of 100 yardsHaul down the flag said the captain of the big steamerWell captain began the young manon the bridge when at speaking distance a practical lesson is worth anyamount of talk I merely wished to convince you that we know how to handleour guns and that our guns can penetrate your rotton plates Besides youwill have something to show for yourmoney when you get to port I take itwe will have no further trouble butIll give you five minutes more if youwish to consult togetherThe miners had no desire to bedrowned neither did they wish to giveup their goldGet him aboard captain said theirleader and well have a fight for itWe are all heeled and once we get thatvillain and part of his crew on deckIhere you keep out of the way if youlike and well handle himYou couldnt run down thatpirate Isuppose suggested another more cautious than the restNo more than I could run downQueen Charlotte islands with thiscraft replied the captain dolefullyTime shouted the man on thebridgeWell give you the gold said thecaptain returning to his placeAll right And so that there will beno temptation to pla3r us any tricks forthe amount I understand is demoralizingly large I will stay here and receiveyour packages Two of my men will goaboard you and two others will workthe ferry between your craft and mineThose four men I can easily spare andif you kill or capture them you are welcome to do so but in that case I shallundoubtedly sink the ship If you willthink over the crisis for a moment youwill see that nothing else is left for meto do It is the only safe plan therefore I trust there will be no troubleThere wasnt The miners saw atonce that there was little use in makinga row and in a short time the preciouscargo was transferred from the ship tothe yacht It came in boxes and bags inlarge quantities and in small and theman on the bridge opened every package so that there was no chance of fooling him When the transfer was complete the young man sang outI wish you good captain and asafe voyage It may strike you asstrange that I do not sink the ship nowand so destroy all evidence against meI assure you that I gave the plan thedeepest consideration and if unfortunately one life had been lost youwould all have gone to the bottom butas it is this is only robbery or piracyft ijEtjCi vStfiar tiff fw svIF

showed that all hope ofkeeping her in sight for long was hopeless With sad hearts the plundered passengers watched her grow smaller andsmaller to the south of them while theBear churned her leisurely coursethrough the waveless seaAt last the lookout shoutedThe yachts coming back sirThe captain put his glasses to hiseyes and gazed for a long time at thehorizon to the southBy jingo she is he said turning atrifle less ruddy Then he said to themate What do you think of itHes xrobably changed his mind andis going to sink us I thought he didntseem to be more than half convincedwhen he talked of not doing it Whatare we to doI dont know anything to do saidthe captain hopelessly swearing inwardly that if he escaped lie would havea faster steamer next voyage or quit thehigh seasEveryone aboard was now watchingthe northern bound yacht and thesame disquieting thought seemed toTunthrough every mind even before one ofthe passengers gave voice to his fearsSuddenly the captain cried out with

has therefore changed its statusrfour times in a century and a half asa national heirloomr In the bishops garden at Peterborough one died in 1821 which was saidIto have exceeded 220 vears Thebetfh

Golville governor ofiuaunnus sent to the Zoological gardens a tortoise weighing 285 poundsIt was four feet four inches lonur andjhad been in Mauritius for 67 years Theexact period was known for thisHoise was brought to that island fromthe Seychelles in 1766 by ChevalierMarion du Fresne At that time it wasfull grown so that its real age was probably much greater In the Museum ofNatural History at South Kensingtonjare remains ot Aldabra tortoise of thespecies now presented to the Zoologicalsociety by Mr Walter Rothschild whichthough only known to be 80 years- oldgveighed 870 pounds and was still growing at the time of its deathThe structure of the tortoise contributes a large share of their preeminence in length of life Their bodiesare spared the whole of that exhausting process of collapse and expansionswhich we call breathing The cruelwear and tear of this incessant motioninvolving work of lungs muscles ribsand air passages unnoticed in healthbut one of the most distressing factsfrevealed by illness does not fall on thehappy tortoise His shell packpiecetand breastplate alike is as rigid as aipiece of concrete He sucksi in air bymaking a vacuum with his tongue andswallows it like water the reservoir instead of a stomach being his capacious-lungs In addition to this enormoussaving of energy the tortoise enjoystwo other structural advantages Hehas no teeth to break decay get outof order and ultimately starve him to-death like those of an old horse orfbroken toothed rabbit Instead he hasfsharp horny edges to his mouth whichdo not break or get out of order Andlastly there is his impenetrable shellA very curious fact in relation to thegiant tortoises is their isolation onsmall remote ocean surrounded islandsat vast distances from land and fromeach other Aldabra for example isaysmall uninhabited island in the Inrcuan ocean nortnwest ot MadagascarOthers are found in ocean archipelagoes like the Sejchelles or recent volcanic islets like the Galapagos off thePacific coast of South America Onerather attractive theory for this isolation of the big tortoises traces theirplantation on these desolate islandsto the old buccaneers It has been contended that the Galapagos islands werethe original home of the giant tortoisesand that the rovers who stocked themon board ship and kept them alive forlong periods may have left them atplaces of call even in remote oceansiduring the long periods in which buccaneering flourished London SpectatorUSES FOR RATTLESNAKE SKINSA Pennsylvania Factory Workingon an Inexlianntible SupplyDown at West Pike on Pine

CONSTANTINOPLEThe Tnrlcs Think Them Unclean ButStill Treat Them KindlyThe reason why there are so fewdogs who have homes and masters isnot hard to find It is because the Turkshave a queer idea it is part of theirqueer religion that dogs are such unclean animals that they must neverbe allowed to enter a house On thestreet however they feed them andeven pet them and when a man knowsthat he has done something wrong hewill Gften try to make up for it yfeeding all the dogs he can find Sometimes when rich Turks die they leavesums of money to be spent in feedingthe street dogs jutet as in America

the quantityand yield of the corn to such an extentthat it will be an item next spring1 tosecure good seed corn The safest andbest plan is to lay in the needed supplyIhis fall and store it away w7here it willlceep in good conditionThe best time to select the seed cornjs in the fall as soon as the grain iswell hardened In addition to makingsure of a good supply selecting m theiield in the fall affords a better opportunity for making the best selection asthe stalk as well as rthe ear can beconsidered which af course cannotbe done after the corn is oribbedWhen the conditions of growth willadmit the best seed coifn is that whichis selected from what is grown on thefarm provided of course that propercare is taken in the selectionWhen the first selection is made atis always best to select irathera largerquantity than will be -needed Thisgives an opportunity of making a second selection One itemin selectinglheears is to choose those -that are wellfilled both at the tip and at the buttThe grain should be sound and deepWhile it is difficult to secure a very3arge ear without a fairly good sizedcob yet getting ears with -deep grainswill make a considerable difference inthe size of the cob So far as can bedone the ears should be uniform incolor shape of grain and time ofAfter a sufficient quantity is -securedat should be thoroughly dried and thenstoned where it will keep dry and besafe from vermin One of the mostserious objections to taking seed jornfrom a crib in the spring is the riskthart its vitality may have been injuredby its being damp when thrown intothe crib or while standing in the fieldand then being frozen Exposure tocold does not injure the vitality whenthe grain is thorough dry but if dampit is often seriously injured by frostGood seed is so essential to a goodgrowth and yield that it will be goodeconomy to use all reasonable care tosecure a full supply St Louis RepublicSurface Water in WellsWells are often dug- in depressions theIdea being that in such

bloodremedies fail to effect a cure Thoughit is naturally disheartening to the sufferer who faithfully takes the prescribedtreatment of the physicians often at theexpense of hundreds of dollars to findhimself no better as time goesby still a cure will result from the rightremedy SSS no matter what othertreatment has failedThe reason that SSS Swifts Specific has so successfully cured even theworst cases after other treatment hadbeen tried In vain is that it is the onlyremedy which forces the poison fromthe blood and permanently eliminatesit from the system which is the onlycorrect principle of curing the diseaseMercurial remedies bottle up the poisonand tear down the system while SSSforces out the poison and builds up andadds- strength and vigor to the entiresystem It is natures remedy and contains no harmful ingredientMr Charles Glenn of 1563 Dudley StCincinnati is one of the many whoconstantly praise S for giving himback his health He saysFrom childhood I was afflicted witha terrible blood disease and havetaken almost every blood remedy on themarket but my case was deepseatedand one by one they failed The largered blotches increased in size and number and soon covered my entire bodyMy parents had me treated by a number of physicians but the disease wastoo much for them and after their temporary relief was over I found myselfgrowing steadily worse Thus

called tome and led the way to the bade yardThere is the last of ourstock ofpoultry said she pointing to a littlebantam cock that was strutting- aboutthe yard I havent the heart to killhim because he is a net If vou wanthim you can take him and dbas youlike wirh himDuring the campaign of 1863 he often sat on my shoulder through thelong weary marches and hurried retreats and I shared my rations withhim One night we had reached theflank of the enemys camp by a forcedmarch and lay down to sleep on ourarms expecting to be rousedat thebreak of day for a sudden charge- J hadstarted off with General perched uponmy musket barrel and a sudden changein the order of march had separated usfrom the wagons so I placed the rooster on the limb of a sapling above myhead while I lay down to snatch a fewminutes sleepGeneral did not utter a single cluckin protest although he must have beenvery hungry from long fasting butquietly squatted on the branch while Iflung myself on the grass and leavesand was soon fast asleep I was soweary that I slept profoundly until Iwas suddenly aroused by an unearthlyscreech in my ear Eaising my head Itook in the whole situation at a glanceGeneral had dropped down from hisperch and uttered a shrill crow right inmy ear which had awakened me and asI opened my eyes I saw the flash of gunsas our pickets fired and in anihstantfell back upon us where we lay TheYankees had turned thetables oh usand discovering our presence the surprising force became the surprised andin ten minutes there was an unearthlyracket going on in that pine thicketEight and left of my position theboys came out of cover and advancedwith yells and cheers moving cautiously and firing as they moved It had become sufficiently light for me to findmy few belongings and I soon recovered my hat and haversack which Xhadforgotten to pick up in the hurry of thefirst surprise and juAfc at that- time Iwas saluted with a loud crow just abovemy head and looking up I savGeneralperched upon his limb he having flownback there when the firing began andwith his head held on one side he wassidling along the swaying branch crowing and cluckingIn spite of the banging of the gunsand whistling of bullets General stuckbravely to his perch and never flutteredduring the entire engagement WhenI told the story in camp that nightGeiieral was the toast of the eveningand he was treated to all sorts of tidbits in recognition of his gallantryon the field of actionOne morning however GeneralI played the camp detective in a mostalarming manner which came nearproving disastrous 1 j a fellow soldier ofanother mess All foraging had beenstrictly forbidden and no man was allowed to leave the ranks under theheaviest penalty of military disciplineThere was a fellow by the name of JimNessmith who occupied a tent not farfrom that of the captain of our company About 4 oclock the order was passed along the lines fpr us to -prepare tomarchGeneral was perched on the limb ofa bush near me while I sat munchingmy hard tack and all of a sudden heraised himself on his perch and crowedlustily Of course no cock in hearingcould resist replying to such a challengeand from within the tent occupied byJim Nessmith came the muffled crow ofan old rooster Jim made a grab at thebag and succeeded in choking him offbut the noise had reached the ears ofsome of the others and the captain became apprised of the fact that Jim hadbeen f onaging A hasty examination ofhis tent disclosed the body of the bigrooster choked to death by Jim in hisanxiety to put a stop to his untimelycrowingJim was ordered under arrest pending an investigation but just about thattime the order came to advance and wemoved forward and by sunrise we werefighting and the unfortunate officerwho had ordered Jim to be placed under arrest was borne from the field acorpse after the fight was over The affair was forgotten amid the stirringscenes that followedSeeing that the end was near Ifound an opportunity to send Generalto the rear and placing him in a cagestarted him on the long journey to thehome of a nephew ii Georgia He hadnot been long on the farm before he began to pine and droop and the familythought that he was disconsolate on account of being separated from his comrades This might have been all fancybut he lived only a short time andwhen he died my nephew and the boysof the neighborhood gave him a regularmilitary funeral 7I suppose that his is the only graveof a rooster in Georgia The tiny stonesthat mark his last resting place can beseen on the old homestead -near
