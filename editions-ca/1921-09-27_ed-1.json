A PARAMOUNT PICTURE. A scream in the night!-and all was still. Sherlock Wells, the great detective, awoke from
his vigil yawned and a secret panel closed behind a retreating figure. Next morningholy mackerel enough had happened
to keep the whole blamed town in gossip for a year. Enough to show 'em what a real detective can do for a beautiful maiden
when he dons trusty disguise and gets his clever clues a-workin' ! A picuture with all charm and heart appeal that made Chas.
Rey the best loved actor on the screen. And more laughs than the "hick" sleuth's pup had fleas.
