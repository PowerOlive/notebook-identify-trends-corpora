COLD WAVE WARNINGS ARE
Egg farming is in a class by itsettV
Other farm crops are liable to meet
with fluctuating prices, but this does
not come to the egg farmer. The
price of eggs is about the same,
month by month, one year with an
other, and it is continually raising.
Most other crops require expensive
lands and costly fertilization. The
egg crop5can be raised on very cheap
land, and hen3 themselves make a.
salable fertilizer.
