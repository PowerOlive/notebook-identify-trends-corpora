the Hawaiian Japanese controversy Yoshibuni Muerota Japaneseminister to Mexico made the followingstatement There are many Japanesein Hawaii and they have rights whichmight be interfered with in the eventof annexation What if the UnitedStates respected these rights in sucha case there might be no objection onthe part of my government HoweverHawaii is now an independent countryin the Pacific and Japan would preferto have it kept independentEven if the United States shouldcarry out their policy of non interference in European or eastern affairsin case the island should become apart of the American union some contingency might arise forcing them tochange that policy of neutrality Forinstance Hong Kong is an iinportautBritish settlement and if Americahad any question with Great Uritaiuthe possession of these islands in thePacific might lead as an accident incolonial politics to an expansion of theAmerican domain far beyond theirpresent intentions This is the reasonwe prefer to have Hawaii wholly independentThe minister said that all the talkabout an alliance between Japan andSpaiu against the United States is erroneousNo such thing is contemplated hewent on to say Japan owes its modern renaissance to the United Statesthrough whose efforts the country wasthrown open to the world We consider the Uuited States in that senseour mother countryEven if the United States

himself in his -room to finish theletter begun the previous evening1 Hewent about it leisurely placing thetable in front of an open window andsitting where the sweet afternoonbreeze might blow jn his face as hewrote Between the sentences hestopped of tenweigliing and turning thewords until they fitted his purposewhich was to make this latest letter tohis mother as one with those precedingit This preserving of the unities provedto be less difficult than he had thoughtit would be The new determinationwas but a suckling as yet and the turning of a fresh leaf in the book of resolutions is in any event only a beginning Besides ones mother is alwaysthe first to accept a show of franknessas a substitute for the real qualityand Mrs Thorndyke would have foundreasons for refusing to believe Philipif he had told her the plain truthThe window in the attic bedroomlooked out upon the stretch of yellowroad leading to Allacoochee and inone of the inter sentence pauses Philipsaw two horsemen ride over the crestof the spur which shut off the view ofthe lower valley They halted amongthe trees on the hillside and one ofthem pointed to the farmhouse whilethe other took something from hispocket and went through the motionsof a man- drinking from a bottle Philipwatched them listlessly until at theend of a full minute his curiosityawoke to comment upon the phenomenal thirst of the man who still sat likean equestrian statue with arm bent andhead thrown back There was a fieldglass hanging in its case on the walland when Philip took it down and focused it upon the statuesque horsemanthe mystery speedily took another formThe man was not drinking he was examining the house and the adjacentmountain through a glass not unlikethe one in whose field Philip was observing himThorndykes first thought was of Kilgrow and his persecutors but before hecould form a plan for warning the oldmountaineer the two horsemen rodedown to the house and he heard one ofthem ask Airs Duncan if the road ledto Alta Springs a village on the westernslope of Johns mountain Since thequestion appeared to explain the reconnaissance Philip let his suspicionslapse and straightway forgot the incident when the travelers had ridden onHe had finished his letter and was beginning to wonder if Duncan wouldsucceed in finding Kilgrow when heheard voices below followed by stumbling footsteps on the stairs andDuncan entered with the old mountaineerThis is auld Johnnie lveelgrowMaster Thorndyke he said presentinghis companion with a perpendiculargesture which seemed to call attentionto

enough to be careful MrDuncan were not likely to spoil ourchances of success by being over-prudentThats gude seasonable Scotchsense d ye ken that Johnnie mansaid Duncan forgetting for the momentthat

warmed toward the old man whenhe was at leisure toread the story ofprivation and distress written so jlainly on the thin face and in the restlesseyes It was some sense of the needfor encouragement that prompted himto speak first in terms of assuranceDuncan has told me all about jrourcase Mr Kilgrow and I want you tobelieve me when I say that youre inno danger whatever of prosecution onthe oftd

your figure at what you think youought to have when I tell you thattheyre selling your land at five hundred dollars for a strip a foot wide anda hundred feet longThe problem was too abstruse for

it has appeared that the onty experiments performed without anaesthetics are of the nature of inoculationsor hypodermic injections These saysthe medical inspector for the home office Dr G V Poore are now in orderto lessen any chance of misapprehension placed in a class by themselvesAccording to the report the process ofinoculation is inadequately providedfor in the act of parliamentIt would be cruel rather than otherwise to anaesthetize an animal beforesubjecting it to the trivial operation ofa prick with a needle and yet the wording of the act is such that the administration of anaethetics can in no case bedispensed with except by a certificateA stating that insensibility cannotbe produced without necessarily frustrating the objects of such experiments Notwithstanding that thewording of certificate A is not whollyapplicable to the circumstances it isnevertheless allowed for inoculationsThe large increase of inoculations andallied -experiments which has been noticeable for the last few years is saysthe report likely to continue The discovery of antitoxins has necessitated alarge number of inoculation experiments as these remedies cannot safely and eff ectually be used upon humanbeings without being previously testedon rodents In one class Table A thetotal number of experiments was 1516and in the other Table B 5984 Nearly all the latter were inoculationsmade under anaesthetics upon rodents with the object of diagnosingrabies The licensees have beealoyal tothe spirit of the act and there wereonly two cases in which the letter of thelaw was quoted as showing the difficulties of interpreting the act in relationto inoculationThe first case was that of a licenseewho holds a certificate A dispensingwith anaesthetics for the inoculationof guinea pigs with tuberculous matter In his annual return he f eportedfour inoculations as performed underA for which an anaesthetic was administered It was necessary to takenotice of this because certificate A isnever allowed except for proceedingsso slight as to cause no -appreciablepain This gentleman has explained tome that anaesthetics were used becauseit was necessary to insure perfect tranquility while a minute incision wasmade in the skin but that after the recovery from the anaesthetic the animals never afforded any evidence of discomfort This being the case it is possible that the experiment might havebeen performed under the license alonebut it clearly could not be allowed under certificate A as used in relation toinoculations The second case was thatof a gentleman who holds a license onlyand who returned four experimentswhich consisted in the attempt whichfailed to give ringworm to four miceby applying the fungus which is thecause of the disease to the backs of theanimals by a few bloodless scratcheswithout anaesthetics It would becruel rather than otherwise to administer an anaesthetic for such a proceeding No experiment under the license alone however can be performedwithout an anaesthetic and the licenseeheld no certificate enabling him to dispense with anaesthetics It might possibly be contended that such a proceeding is not an experiment calculated to give pain within the meaningof the act This however is a questionwhich has to be decided by the licenseeand those who sign his application fora license N Y TimesAn Abiding PerfumeNearly six years ago a farmerwho was bringing five or six carboysof essence of peppermint in town had arunaway on West Franklin street nearthe Christian church and fiveof thecarboys were broken Owing to thevalue of the essence his loss amountedto something like 1500 a total losswith no insurance The point in reviving the incident is that the pungent odor of the liquid which heavily burdened the atmosphere in thatvicinity for months still clings to theearth where the liquid was spilled andthe neighborhood small boy delightsin mystifying the uninformed by picking up clods of the earth and calling attention to the odor Occasional-

suicide than woman This istrue of man in regard to epilepsy crimeand other marked signs of degeneration But it has been observed that aswoman approaches man in her mode oflife she also becomes more familiarwith those abnormal conditions whichhave previously been peculiar to menThe comparative immunity of womanfrom self destruction in the past hasdepended greatly upon the relativelyless harassing part she has taken in thestruggle for life ToJday it is differentNow woman occupies the fields of artliterature finance and even politicsand as she goes deeper into these vocations she must expect to suffer theconsequences Already it is noticeablethat feminine suicide is not now entirely due to the sentimental causes of disappointed love desertion and jealousy r -but to those trials of a more materialorder such as have led men to the actof self destructionImitation far exceeds any other ofwhat are called trivial causes of suicide and asserts itself more in womanthan in man It is muchmore common thajn is supposed When self-destructionbecomes epidemic as it sometimes does its prevalence very largelydepends upon imitation It is said thatmany years ago the wail of ThomasHood over The One More Unfortunatebrought anany a sentimental person toa grave in the Thames Andin our own day the vivid representationof suicide upon the stage under conditions appealing forcibly to the imagination has been known to be followed bythe self imposed death of persons whoseconditions resembled closed those ofthe suicide in the dramaAttempts have been made to provethat climate has an effect upon the rateof suicide but these attempts havenever done morel Than show that thetemperate regions have the highest ratio This of course is not due tc theclimate but to the more complicatedcivilization the greater physical andmental wear and the more extensiveinterference with natural laws metwith in the temperate regions Whileit is true that climate exerts but littleinfluence over the rate of -suicide theseasons on the contrary do stronglyaffect it The popular belief is thatsuicide is more frequent during themonths of winter and spring Thishowever is incorrect Cold wet dampweather does not as so many peoplesuppose promote despondency and suicide Strange as it may seem ut thatperiod of the year -when the sufferingsof the poor and the sick are least wlhenemplojment is more readily obtainedwhen the pleasure of living should beat its highest suicide is most frequentMay June and July themonths of aong -andsunshine in all countries give thegreatest number of selfHmurders Forthis there is no satisfactory explanation unJess we accept that of the medical fraternity which is that duringthe period of early summer the organism is working at a higher tensionevery function of mind and body ismore active than at any othjer periodof the year and consequently there isgreater liability to sudden physical andmental collapse Popular ScienceMonthlyA Renl CalamityGuy Pity Cliolly is so awfully

Lord is thereBoston WatchmanammmJ owboy Uirtuoso fpersistence of MrEimeJenksatlength received its due reward liewas asked to fiddle for a danceYon may remember that this gentleman who was second to none when itcame -to close quarters in the branding-penor following a wild calfthrough the sage brush had not oneounce of musical capacity in the 160 oddpounds of his make up yet had a particular ambition and an unflagging zealto become a fiddler The object of thiswriting is to show that he receivedample returns upon the zeal investedebufe never attained to the ambitionFor so many years that the memoryof man runneth not to the contraryJie had packed a violin in his bed rollon the annual round up and at everyopportunity when the days work wasdone he Tosined his bow Throughoutthe winter months when work waslight and evenings long he had practiced faithfully if not intelligently iniJie bunk house until banished by aplebiscite to a near by dug out wherelie found sacks of onions and bins of potatoes more patient sufferers than thegeneral sitting room afforded In someformer year the outfit had boasted ainan who could play any instrumentand Jenks seeing how easy it was decided to become equally accomplishedThe violin was not his first choice buthis first opportunity and having accepted vit his code of ethics bound himto ibreak the critter or break the cinchOn the 29th of February there was aleap year dance at Itichmonds Thisplace was on a hill in the border landbetween the open range and the settlements and however much cowboysmight despise farmers and farmers detest cowboys the social amenities wererarely disturbed and the country dancewas a popular institution My friendBice voiced the general sentiment thusI like em because everybody isa lcping and a skipping and if anybody falls down he gits up again Theplain inference from Mr Rices statement is that at any other than a country dance if one falls down he staysdown which might embarrass and endanger his betters When I calledRices attention to this he explainedthat he meant in your mind Its likegetting on to a bucking horse anymorning after breakfast and beingdumped he said You dont mind itmuch but just tighten your cinch another hole and climb on again Butsuppose you are doing some fancy riding or roping at the county fair andyour saddle gets emptied why youfeel so low down you dont get over itfor a weekOur boys all went over to the danceat Richmonds and some one evidentlytold the committee that Mr Jenks was acompetent fiddler for soon after his arrival he was apjroached by a brighteyed young woman who asked if hehad brought his violinNo I did not replied the startledJenks liervouslv fingering a large pieceof rosin which he produced from apocket but if you want to use it Illbe very glad to go back to the ranchand fetch it It is only about 20 miles1 was told said the girl just slightly showing several white teeth thatyou carry your violin with you whereveryou go and Im sorry to find that itsnot true Our music has disappointedlis the house is full of people and nobody here to play for them but a celloand a mouth organ But I think we canget a violin within less than 20 milesand here she showed him the fullset will you kindly play for us untilMr Smith arrivesMiss I should be delighted saidJenksOh thank you so much interposed the girlIf 1 knew how he continued but JI dont You sec Im only learning Ican just start a fewOh I am sure you will do it wellshe replied and I will go right outand send for an instrument and sheliurried awayMr Jenks was astonished and perplexed Of course he had hoped to playiii public at some time but this was sosudden lie was not in a hurry Someother leap year would be soon enoughShould he bolt or face his ownKiev n at a very

some pretty bad breaksand the first one of you that snickerswill eat his instrument right here Areyou readyJenks is not afraid of any individualmanperhaps notvery much afraid of anywoman but when lie stood up on thatplatform with the fiddle in his neckand faced the crowd he was badly rattledPlay a waltz first said the floormanager and play slowly With asigh of relief and a thought of WhatllI do when they demand fast musicMr Jenks began that classical strain1which fits the words Where oh whereis my little dog gone the cello andmouth organ struck in the girls chosethe best waltzers the floor filled upfeet shufflled boards creaked and theball was openedAccomplished speakers have recorded the difficulty experienced in learning to think upon their feet but Jenksfacing an audience for the first timeand sawing away desperately at th6first bars and repeat of a slow waltzhad no such trouble He told me after4wards that his thoughts thunk themselves and came a running and thathe was conscious of three distincttrains of thought running on paralleltracks The first concerned Mr Smiththe delinquent musician the secondsubject was what a very pretty girlwhen she laughs and the third accented to waltz time ran Oh I nevercan play them that second strain Jknow Ill break down if I tryTo anticipate difficulty is to insureit After repeating the first strain some20 times Jenkins made a desperate effort to strike the second movementfailed and collapsed The cello andmouth organ hammered along uncertainly for a time and ceased Thestranded waltzers dotted the floor likeboats becalmed on a miniature lakeThe waltzers had been so engrossedin their own efforts and the rest of usin looking on that the quality of themusic had apparently received little attention When the player broke downthere was only a general movement ofimpatience at the interruption and Ilooked to see the persistent Jenks startup again on the same eight measuresBut he had entirely recovered his selfpossession Laying the fiddle aside headvanced to meet the girl at whose request he had made the effortDont you think he asked thatI have proved that I cannot playWell it does come pretty close to ademonstration she answered but ITHE BALL WAS OPENEDthank you very much for helping usout Mr Smith has come and will relieve you-So Mr Smith took the fiddle andJenks took the girl hand for the firstdance and perhaps for others and theevening was a successMany hours afterward as we rode-sleepily homeward in the gray light ofmorning Jenks said to me What avery pretty girl when she laughsWhat did she say about your playing I askedSaid I must play at the next leapyeur dance 1900 is not a leap year youknow would give me eight years topracticeDid you promiseI promised not to told her I hadsomething better to work for nowRime Jenks is a rather taciturn fellow and I am not in his confidence butI know that he goes pretty often toRichmond Hill and he has traded hisfiddle for a cow I have also noticed himstudying a

slay the mastodon restrJing beneath the shade of the tropicverdure- that lined its banks Every-thing regarding the era or nature of thestream flowing there is mere conjeelure but some things regarding it arewell known One is that it was astream of no mean proportions For aquarter of a mile in width the bedrockis covered with the rounded gravelwashed smooth by its waters during theages that it existed and even after thecountless years since its springs dried tup at their source or some convulsionwof nature turned it into other channelhave been washimr the easily roiledStones down the mountain sides theyarestilia25feet in depth perhaps morein places Another thing certain aboutthe old river is that its source was faraway beyond the Coeur cPAleneor the Bitter Roots that hedgethem on the east for ingreat quantitiesamong the gravel now choking isoldbed are huge bowlders of a rock that is-entirely foreign to this region Resembling a mixture of sandstone andquartz if such -a mixture can ibe imagined it is a rock that is unmistakable and nowhere within more than100 miles around is it found in anyplace except the -channels of present orprehistoric streamsAnother thing known regarding theold river more patent than all else except perhaps to the student is thefact that it traversed a country interspersed with gold bearing ledges partsof which are picked up and broughtdown with its gravel Everywhere thatthe old channel Jhdsbeemcut it has beenfound Tich iiijgold Many of the smallergulches about Murray were rich up tothe point where they had been cutthrough the old channel and above ittheir gravel nvas barren of the yellowmetalThe most economical way to handlethis old wash was by hydraulic mining but water was too scarce for morethan the few to do this and manyothers have taken the slower way ofdrifting With gravel spreading from50 to 500 yards in width and varyingfrom five to tone hundred and fifty feetin dearth probably pne half of the goldwould lie in a -strip arodwide and within five feet of bed rock So while thehydraulic miners would proceed tomove the whole mass wash it down thehill and sifting out every particle ofgold the dxift miner has

anearly incident that may have had agood deal to do with the course ofrnysubsequent life V4I enlisted as a private at the outbreakof the war being then a boy of17rather mature looking however forthose years Like all boys of ftiatageI was of a romantic turn but exceed-ingly bashful in the presence of womenNo parting in all that time of part- tlOn Ot the DUDllCmg was more airecnng man was ourswhen my regiment started for the frontWhen a year later I wassent back toChicago to recover from a wound in thejaw I found myself as dear to her asever and she as dear to me it goeswithout saying I was in the hospitalat Camp Douglas My wound healedrapidly I was allowed to go about thecity very much as I chose and prayermeetings with their escort privilegesclaimed a great part of my attention -Aboutthat time the Y M C Aiwas organizing a regiment to be composed exclusively of men who professedreligion The scheme naturally attracted a great deal of attention The paperswere full of it I was selectedone of the new regiments companies Protest against the selection wasmade on account of my age then just18 The matter was carried up to theadjutant general of tho state who finally decided in my favor My age thesingular character of the case and thepopularity of the regiment caused suchan amount of newspaper gossip that itseemed as though everybody must haveheard of the matter at least All thistime I never wore my uniform outsideof camp The dear girl therefore never saw me except in citizens clothesIts an outrage she said just afterwe met a very youthful looking man incaptains uniform on one of our walksthat such young men are trusted withthe responsibilities of command I dontknow what the country is coming toFor a moment I was overcome bythe shock When I recovered my breathI told her that youth did not necessarilydebar a man from possession of thequalities of a commander She declinedto be convinced and the conversationbecame decidedly chilly Instead ofmaking my cuctomary call wrieli wereached her house I stopped at the frontgateLaura I said I must tell yougoodby My regiment has orders toleave for the front tomorrow It maybe that we never shall see each otheragainBut we did All fashionable Chicagocame to Camp Douglas the next day tosee the final dress parade of the muchtalked of Y M C A regiment and Icould see the dear girl among the crowdMy new captains uniform gave me agood deal of satisfaction just at thattime I can tell you The colonel of theregirnent had asked me on account ofthe power of my voice to act as adjutant for the occasion That furnishedadditional gratification The parade hadthe magnificent splendor that only adress parade can have and the solemnityof this occasion was vastly increased bythe reflection not to be dismissed thatmany of those among regiment and spectators were seeing each other for thelast time on earth The band played asthough speaking our last farewell toour friends Every one I am sure wasdeeply impressed It was at t3
