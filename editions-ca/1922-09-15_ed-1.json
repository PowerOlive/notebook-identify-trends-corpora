PRESS J?AIR TO HIM
(Washington Post)
Men prominent in public life occa
sionally complain of the manner in
which their utterances and actions
are handled in the newspapers
Sometimes one of them will resort to
the expedient of refusing to receive
newspaper men, but- such attempts
are rarely of long duration, because
sooner or" later the official has some
thing he wishes to convey to the
public and press is the most logical
and effective channel of distribu
tion. Among those, on the .other
hand, who have no complaint to
make regarding their treatment by
writers, former Vice-President
Marshall is a prominent figure.
While receiving a group of newspa
per, men at the Willard during his
recent visit to Washington, he de
clared that in all his political career
he had never had occasion to com
plain because of the way in which
the papers had treated him.
"I'm rather at a loss to under
stand that," he said. '"Nearly
every one I know has had a little
trouble along that line, now and
then at least, with papers that were
opposing his policies. But I have
always been treated very fairly,
Neibuu, ui. m. m. x., ,nd Qf cours6f that nas been a
Welcome Address f f iAam,. "
Mr Marshall then took the
writers into his confidence by admit
ting that he sometimes thought he
had made a mistake by not taking
up newspaper work as a profession.
"I can't think of anything that
would be niQre pleasant than to be
able to write about any subject in
which I was interested and to have
thousands of readers of my views,"
he declared.

Favoring weather gives the farm
er a splendid opportunity to cut and
house his tobacco. When one makes
a little mental calculation he finds
that a successful tobacco crop
touches more of our papulation than
any tther crop in the county, with
the possible exception of corn.
This year's corn crop has been
greatly damaged by the recent storm
and therefore tobacco becomes for
this reason a bigger mainstay for
our people.
A greater diversification with im
proved farm methods would be pro
ductive of better crop results. After
all the farmer and his man, John,
should gef a greater compensation
for his year's toil.
It is timely to remark that the
"pool" working successfully will be
a blessing for the grower of tobac
co from the fact that this crop is his
mainstay this yeaf. The work of
the "pool" last year should satisfy
anyone that the movement that
brings agreater price is the one to
o'clock yesterday afternoon, with ' pin faith on. Success to the "pool."
