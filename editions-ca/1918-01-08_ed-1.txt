Doubtless, they will soon be in everyplace where soldiers are gatheredin considerable numbers for training. The Young Women's ChristianAssociation is a GovernmentAgency for War Work, like theY.M C.

INCLAIMS FOE EXEMPTION.Kentucky had the greatest number of exemption claims of anyState, it was made public at Washington in a report giving statistics,of the selective draft operations.'Fifty-two per cent, of all men called jin Kentucky filed affidavits. The,average numaer or ciaima waa -uper cent.Montana led among the States inthe number of men called who filedno claim for exemption. Figuresfor that State show that 80 per centof men called up were ready to goto the front.There was evidently some variation of practice among the Stateson the question of exempting married men. A total of 163,115 married men have been certified for service. In Mississippi, the boardsheld 38 per cent of all married mencalled for service; in Wisconsinand North Dakota, only eight perrent were held. After further studyof the result it is expected effortswill be made to unify the practiceof boards more closely in this regard. (. m Fa mMASTER'S SALE.Auctioneer M. F.

About every thing else inthe country is doing its bit in helping the conservation of food andfuel, and now the humble shovelthat feeds your furnaces and stovesis going to be an instrument in thegame.Mr. James H. Thompson, of Paris,Chairman of the Federal Fuel Committee for Bourbon County, is in receipt of a letter from the UnitedStates Fuel Administration at Washington, in which the most importantpart of the plan is set forth as follows: "In order to impress upon thepublic the necessity for frugality inthe use of coal, the Conservation Division of the Fuel Administrationhas named January 30, 1918, as'Tag-Your-Shovel-Day.' Tags representing a shovel, and bearing suggestions for saving coal, are to betied by the school children to practically every coal shovel in thecountry on this date. Like the proverbial 'string around the finger' toremember by, these tags will act asa constant reminder to the householder to use his coal frugally."The Superintendent of Schoolsof your State has arranged for thedistribution of these tags throughthe children in each school. We areplanning to have the shovels of thePresident, the Governors, the Mayors and other men much in the public eye, tagged on that date, and wewill give the widest publicity tothe work in your section in the col-uninS'Of the local press."More Money From the Same FeedThat's the experience of every farmer who uses AvalonFarms Hog-Tone.

M. Renick, ofthe Paris Milling Company,196.L;pounds of flour will be made by themills from four bushels and twentyfour pounds' of wheat, where thesame amount of flour was formerlymade from four bushels and thirtypounds of wheat.

FRANKFORT, KY.BECSPIIOKr OF GE33IAKY HALTSEEACE PARLEY.LONDON, January 6. Organization of an army of 3,000,000 men,ready to fight again with the alliedforces, may be Kussia's answer topeace overtures of the CentralPowers.The halt in the Russo-Germanpeace negotiations and indicationsof a German refusal to move the conference to Stockholm have reviveduniversal discussion in Petrograd ofa resumption of fighting with agreatly reduced army.Even the most radical Bolshevikiand the most ardent peace advocateshave been aroused by the the German position. They declare a resumption of hostilities is imminentand express belief that it is impossible to organize and make effective asmall army.Indications are that the German attitude is harmonizing domestic differences and is convincing Russiansthat they must fight to save theirrevolutionary principles."Chairman Joffe, of the RussianPeace Delegation, yesterday sent anofficial telegram to the Chairman ofthe German-Austrian, Bulgarian andTurkish Delegations, saying the Russian republic deems it to be necessary to conduct further peace negotiations on neutral soil and suggesting a transfer of the conference toStockholm. The telegram declaresreplies to the message are expectedby Russi at Petrograd.Articles 1 and 2 of the AustroGerman terms submitted December12 (December 25 new style), themessage saysare in direct conflictwith the principles of self-definitionof nations insisted upon by the Russian peace delegation and supportedby the Russian republic and the Central Executive Committee of the Congress of Workmen's and Soldiers'Delegates.Articles 1 and 2 of the AustroGerman terms, as cabled under aBrest-Litovsk date by way of Berlinlast Sunday, covered the ending ofthe state of war and evacuation ofoccupied territory.In Article 2, however, it was declared the people of Poland, Lithuania, Courland and portions of Esthonia and Livonia demanded independence and separation from Russia,and that the German occupation ofRussian territory did not apply tothese districts, which include most ofthe Russian territory captured by- theGermans.The Bolsheviki Foreign Minister,Leon Trotzky, declared the Government of the Russian workers wouldnot consent to the German peace proposals. M. Trotzky's declaration was madebefore the central committee of theCouncil of Soldiers' and Workmen's-Delegates during an address in whichhe denounced in scathing terms Germany's hypocritical peace proposal.Asserting that the Government ofRussian workers would not consentto such conditions, he said if the Central Powers did not agree to free disposal of the destiny of the Polish andLettish nations it would be urgentlynecessary to defend the Russianrevolution. He said the needs of thefront would be satisfied, whateverefforts might be necessary.Representatives from all the frontswho atended the meeting declared thetroops would defend the revolution,but said bread and boots were necessary. 1 ?SAnother good thing about simplicity in dress is that there arenot so many pieces to take off atbedtime.jja9iaiH0CTr7iajv., ttjwus'jy&u.. ,iijjPAIGEMEN WHO REACH 21 TO BE REGISTERED. WASHNIGTON, January 6.America's fighting is to be done byyoung men without families dependent upon their iaoor lor support aimunskilled in necessary industrial aimagricultural work.All men for the war armies stillto be raised by the United States willcome from Class 1 under the newselective service plan.Provost Marshall General Crowderannounces the new policy in an exhaustive report upon the operationof the selective draft law submittedThursday to Secretary Baker andsent to Congress.He said that Class 1 should provide men for all military needs ofthe country, and to accomplish thatobject he urges amendment of thedraft law so as to provide that allmen who have reached their twentyfirst birthdays since June 5, 1917,shall be required to register forclassification.Also, in the interest of fair distribution of military burden he proposes that the quotas of the states ordistricts be determined hereafter onthe basis of number of men in Class1 and not upon population.Available figures indicate, the report says, that there are 1,000,000nhvsicallv and otherwise qualifiedmen under the present registrationwho will be found in Class 1 when allquestionaires have been returned andthe classification period ends February 15.To this the extension of registration to men turning 21 since June 5of last year and thereafter will add700,000 effective men a year.Class 1 comprises:Single men without dependentrelatives; married men who havefamilies, who are dependent uponhabitually failed to support theirwives for support or not usefully engaged, and whose families are supported by incomes independent oftheir labor; unskilled farm laborers,unskilled industrial laborers, registrants by or in respect of whom nodeferred classification is claimed ormade, registrants who fail to submitquestionaire and in respect of whomno deterred ciassmcauon is ciauueuor made, and all registrants not ""'Rye Ear, Nose and Throat.eluded in any other division of the j 3 fscheduleNarrowed down under the analysisof the first draft made in the report,the plan places upon unattachedsine-le men and married men with independent incomes most of theweight of military duty, for the aggregate number of men in the otherdivisions of Class 1 is very small. -General Crowder finds that the firstydraft surpassed the highest expectations of tEe friends of the selective'service idea. He pays "high tributenot only to the thousands of civilianswho crave unffrudsrine: servitie to malting the plan a success, but also to the?j,high patriotism ot the American,people as a whole.
