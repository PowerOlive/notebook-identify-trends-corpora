Taia Week Will BeDevoted to the Army Ileorsan nationBill GnrI Debate Will Continue for Fifteen HoursWashington Jan 23 The fact thatthe bill was made the unfinished business of the senate by Saturdays vote does not necessarity insure its immediate consideration Thegeneral understanding- is that this billwill wait upon the peace treaty andthe appropriation bills and that theIndian appropriation bill will be thefirst measure to receive the attentionof the senate during the week Thediplomatic and pension appropriationbills also may be considered duringthe weekSeveral speeches on the general subject of expansion are expected to bemadeHow much time will be given to thetreaty in executive session will dependupon whether the committee on foreign relations considers it in the interest of the treaty to press considerationThere is an effort to arrange a compromise which would permit speedyaction upon the treaty butif this is not successful-the indications are for considerabledelay Two compromises are suggested One of these is for a modificationof the treaty or the adoption of a resolution declarator against the permanent holding of the Philippine archipelago and the other is for a modification of the army reorganization bill onlines desired by the treaty opponentsIt is not yet possible to state whethercither course will be pursuedThe time of the house this week except Monday which has been set asidefor the consideration of District of Columbia business will be devoted to thearmy reorganization bill The consideration of this bill which is regardedas pre eminently the most importantpeneral measure to come before congress at this session has been delayed bythe illlness of Chairman Hull of themilitary affairs committee He has recovered sufficiently to pilot the measure however and the house has formally agreed to take up its considerationon Tuesday The general debate notincluding three night sessions is tocontinue 15 hours This is as far asthe agreement goes It includes noprovision for a final voteThere exist a wide variety of opinions upon the proposition to inci easethe standing army It has a strongmajority of the republicans behind itand it comejinto tb house with theindorsement of the presidents message practically as an administrationmeasureThe democrats and populists are intensely hostile to the whole proposition and intend to fight it to the lastditch They will have some supportfrom the republican side The opposition however do not desire to embarrass the government and are willingto provide for a temporary increasein the army of 50000 men in accordance with the provisions of thesubstitute bill offered by the minorityof the committee Or they are willingto authorize the continuance temporarily of the present war strength ofthe regular army 62000 anything infact to prevent the creation of a permanent increase In this they havethe sympathy of many of the republicans The fate of the bill is in gravedoubtThe bill may not be completed thisweek as the order permits its consideration to be interrupted by appropriation bills and conference reportsGEN MILLERS EXPEDITIONIt Has Landed n Gaimarai Island ThreeMiles From Iloilo Without Opposition From the NativesWashington Jan 23 Gen Millersexpedition has landed on Guimarasisland three miles from Iloilo withoutopposition Gen Otis cables fromManilaLanding was necessary because ofthe crowded condition of the troops onthe transports Experience has provedthat soldiers lose spirit and fightingqualities when confined long on boardship so the war department asked GenOtis to ascertain if it was possible forGen Miller to land his expedition nearIloilo He cabled that it was and wasthen instructed to order a landingIt was deemed inadvisable to havethis expedition return to Manila without having landed because it wasfeared the natives of Luzon wouldthink the Filipinos at Iloilo had repulsed the Americans The presidentspolicy of pacification will be continuedand no attempt to land at Iloilo willbe made at present The island onwhich the men have landed is healthy-Kennedy Got a Life SentenceWilliamson W Va Jan 23 SamP Kennedy was sentenced by the circuit court

lying in the roomand I was thus enabled to get thechange of apparel I so much neededWhen at last we were abed I found itimpossible to sleep and Belin was atfirst equally wakeful For this I wasthankful as I began to grow despondent and felt that after all I had lostthe game utterly But the viscomptescourage never faltered and in spite ofmjself I began to be cheered by hishopefulness He explained to me fullyhow came that he was at the Euedes Deux Mondes He wished to discuss with Palin some means for discovering me and as the Huguenot fearingto return to the rue Yarenne after whathad to happen and yet unwilling toleave Paris had sought Pantins homede Belin had determined to pass thenight here to consult with him givingout to his people that he had gone ona business to MonceauxI will see Sully

this that unless vou are ex-trcmelv unfortunate I regard the rescue of Mme de Bidache as certain 1am as certain that this will lead to thearrest of de Gomeron and his confederates they will taste the

Belin but madames evidence willabsolve vou and we can arrange thatjou are not put to the question atonceThe cool way in which he said thiswould have moved me to furious angeragainst him did 1 not know him to be sotrue e friend As it was I said sharplyThank you 1 will take care that thewheel does not touch nieYery well he answered and nowI shall sleep good nightHe turned on his side and seemed todrop off at once and as I lay throughthe weary hours of that night 1 sometimes used to turn to the still figure atmy side with envy at the peace of hisslumberCHAPTEK XYIIMAITRE PANTIN SELLS fJABBAGESAt last just as my patience was wornto its last shred I saw the glae in thewindow begin to whiten and almostimmediately after heard footsteps onthe landing This was enough for meand unable to be still longer I sprangout of bed and hastened to open thedoor myself It admitted Jacques anda figure in whom I should never haverecognized the notary had I not knownthat it could be no other than PantinJacques bore a tray loaded with refreshments and Pantin held a lanternfor it was still dark in one hand andsomething that looked like the folds ofa long cloak hung in the loop of hisarm The noise of their entrance wokede Belin With a muttered exclamationI did not catch he aroused himself andthe candles being lit we proceeded tomake a hasty toilet As I drew on myboots I saw they were yet wet andmuddy and was about to rate Jacqueswhen Pantin anticipated I told himto let them be so monsieur you havea part to play put this over your lefteye And with these words he handedme a huge patch Then in place of myown hat I found 1 had to wear a frayedcap of a dark sage green velvet with ascarecrow looking white feather sticking from it Lastly Pantin flung overiny shoulders a long cloak of the samecolor as the cap and seemingly as oldIt fell almost down to my heels and wasfastened at the throat by a pair ofleather straps in lieu of a claspFaith exclaimed the viseompte ashe stood a little to one side and surveyed me if you play up to your dressyou are more likely to adoru than raisethe gallows Jacques spoke ofThen Panlin and I started oft on oursearch for the Toison dOrAs he closed the entrance door behind him carefully and Jacques turnedthe key I looked up and down the ruedes Deux Mondes but there was not asoul stirringAll Paris was asleep Above us thesky still swarmed with stars thougha pale band of light was girdling thehorizon Here and there in the heaving inist on the river we saw the feebleglimmer of a lantern that had survivedthrough the night and still served tomark the spot where a boat wasmoored All around us the outlines ofthe city rose in a brown silhouette butthe golden cross on the spire of NotreDame had alreadj caught the dawnand blazed like a beacon against thegray of the skv overheadWe pushed on briskly and by thetime we had reached St Jacques wewere warm enough despite the chilliness of the morning At a stall nearthe church and hard by the Pont NotreDame Pantin purchased a quantity ofvegetables bidding me to keep a littleahead of him in future and guide himin this manner as far as I knew Whilsthe was filling his basket 1 turned uprue St Martin wondering what thenoatrys object could be in transforming himself into a street hawker Iwent slowly stopping every now andagain to see if Pantn was followingand observed that he kept on the sideof the road opposite to me and everand again kept calling out his waresin a monotonous sing song tone Thusfar and for a space further I knewthe road and observing that Pantinwas able to keep me well in view increased my pace until at last we cameto the cross street near which I had metthe jealous Mangel and his wife Upthe cross street I turned without hesitation now almost facing the tall spirethat had been my landmark and I began to think I would be able to tracemy way to the Toison dOr withoutdifficulty when I suddenly came to astandstill and faltered for there werehalf a dozen lanes that ran this wayand that and for the life of me I couldnot tell which was the one I had takenbut a few hours before so differentdid they look now to what they hadappeared by moonlight As I halted ina doubting manner Pantin hurried upand there being one or two near mebegan to urge me to buy his cabbagesI made a pretense of putting him offand then the strangers having passedI explained I had lost my bearings Isee a wineshop open across the roadchevalier go in and call for a flask andawait me he answered rapidlyI nodded and bidding him begonein a loud tone swaggered across thestreet and entering the den it couldbe called by no other name shoutedfor a litre of Beaugency and flung myself down on a rough stool with a clatter of my sword and a great showing ofthe pistol butts that stuck out from mybeltThe cabaret had just opened butearly as I was I was not the first customer for a man was sitting halfasleep half drunk on one of the foulsmelling benches and as I called for

and stood at the door watchingme as I crossed over the street with awarning glance to Pantin and strolledslowly onward A little further on Iturned to my left keeping well in themiddle of the rood to avoid the filth andrefuse thrown carelessly on each sideand as tunned I saw that my man hadgone in I was certain of one thingthat the Toison dOr was not far offand whilst I licked my way slowlyalong Pantin came up to me with hissing song whineHave you found it I asked in a lowtoneNo he sang outAt this moment a figure rose up fromthe steps of a house where I had noticed it crouching a few steps fromme and swung forwardIlola Tis monsieur le capitainehas your excellency tasted the Beaugency the dog poison I tell your excellency there is but one house in theFauborg where they sell it the

gone ten paces hefell forward on his face and lay therein the slime of the streetAt any other time I would havestopped to assist the man but now Icould only look upon his condition asa direct

interested him so deeply a the problem of tbe future life Hewill slso observe that it was alwaysproblem to him one that he was constantly raising that would not stay settled To be sure he was a believer inimmortality but not a restful believerHe was all the time digging up theroots of his faith to be sure they werealive Tbe old question would not stayunanswered The reader of his poetryobserves the same thing He is alwayson the side of faith but of a somewhatdisturbed faith He belonged to thatbody metaphysical society which invitedinto its membership believers of allshades with all shades of unbelieverswhose object was to raise and answerdoubts about God and the future lifeHe was the spokesman of the scientificdoubt of the age fluttering over thedovecots of faith but hardly settlingand resting and nesting thereinOne observes the contrast with thisfluttering faith who reals the poems ofMilton with their abiding faith in thefuture life This is the spiritual contrast between In Memoriam andLycidas In Miltons requiem evenunder its paganized form there is a robust and jubilant faith in God andeternal life No question enters Themind and heart are satisfied The dearfriend is beyond all doubt among thesaints and choirs above One regretsthat Tennysons mental structure perhaps could find positiveness and rest onquestions of politics or poetry butmust perennially dubitate to be surewith the hopeful balance of probabilityover questions of faith I believe Iknow he once said the quantity ofevery word in the English languageexcept scissors but one

gateAntonios dust begrimed face and tumbled hair added to his tattered red shirtand bare feet made him anything buta presentable figure for a drawingroom So evidently thought the burlyhall porter who eyed him from head tofoot with a most supercilious sneerWhat do you want snapped heWe dont allow beggars hereI am not a beggar replied Antonioas quietly as he could I bring hishighness the turbot that he orderedShow it to meIt is for the prince not for yousaid our hero somewhat roughly forhis hot Italian blood was beginning toboil at the lackeys insolenceFellow roared the porter do youknow to whom you speak Doyousuppoie that 1 will suffer any impertinencefrom a barefooted fish ccraperBetter be a barefooted fish scrapeithan an overfed yard dog retorted Antonio And as for impertinence Iwould advise you not to offer too muchof it to meThere was something in the youngfishermans look and tone to say nothing of the broad bladed knife in hisgirdle which made the blustering bullystart back as if Ire had been stung andlook round instinctively for supportYouneedntbe so violent grumblwdhe If you have business with his highness Im quite ready to admit youBut since you wont touch a penny ofhis money unless I do I think its onlyfair that I should have a half share ofitYou a half share in what Ive riskedmy life for shouted Antonio IdsoonerBut just then a thought struck himwhich checked his anger and broughta mischievous twinkle into his brighteyesYou drive a hard bargain said hebut 1 suppose theres no help for itI call to witness St Antonio my patronsaint that whatever I get for this fishyou shall have your fair half of itGood said the porter I know youdarent break that pledge Here Carlotake this fellow inside ard carry thefish to his highnessIn speaking thus the worthy porterwas counting upon Antonios beingpaid and sent away without more adoBut the prince was so delighted at getting his turVot after all that he calledthe young fisherman up into the balcony where he was sitting with hisguests and bade him name his ownpriceMy price said Antonio is a hundred blows of a whip on my bare shouldersAre you mad cried the princestaringNot I Ive named my price and Istick to itWell cried Monte Rosso wishing thumor the supposed joke so be it Tiehim up grooms but strike gentlyHe was obeyed but at the fiftiethstroke Antonio called outHold I have a partnerAnd who is the partner in this hopeful venture laughed the princeYour own porter who made mepromise him a half shareof whatsoeverI gotAnd he shall have it declared theprince Drag him hither grooms andlay on as if you were threshing cornBut the grooms needed no urging topay the porter for all his insolence andthe court jard echoed with his yellsMeanwhile the prince awarded Antoniov ih a hundred gold crowns and promised that the knavish porter should bedismissed forthwith but Antonio whowas not the mar to be bard on a fallenenemy interceded for him and beggedhim offIll spare you this time rascal saidthe prince to the rolling and roaringporter but beware how you offendagain You think yourself very cleverno doubt but this time youve been tooclerby halfAnd the porter himself was of muchthe same opinion

think ornament is mostneeded place them in the parlor orsitting room where a coal lire is burning Then they wonder why it is thatthey have no luck with flowers Theleaves drop off and the plants soon become a mass of naked or rather raggedstems for so long as the plant lives itmust keep during warm weatherenough leaves to absorb oxygen during the daytime which the plant givesoff afterwards It takes also theminute portion of carbonic acid gaswhich is in ail pure air but if it geistoo much of carbonic acid gas as it issure to do in a room where a coal stoveis burning the plant sutlers much as aliving animal might under the same circumstancesOn the farm the best place to keephouse plants is in the kitchen wherea wood fire usually burns and whereall day the steam from boiling waterin a teakettle or from the cooking ofvegetables is always pouring into theroom The kitchen is in the farmhouse the principal living room andilowers are more needed there than inany other in the house There is nothing so good for house plants as moistwarm air It prevents the dust whichwould cover their leaves in a dry atmosphere and if the plants can be exposed to sunlight near a south window during the day they will grow asvigorously as they did out of doors insummer but the plant that has produced abundant flowers in wintershould not be used for winter flowering nor vice versa All the year growthexhausts them and they need a restEven in Florida in localities where itnever freezes most kinds of plants takea rest and almost cease to grow duringthe month when the days are shorterBoston

demoralizedmyself At all events I felt ashamed ofmyselfI consulted with and opened my heart toa friend of the name of Snapper He isa sympathising cuss especially where itco s him nothing Snapper suggestedthat I buy an alarm clock to assist myla k d al yeastIt vis advice and bought oneThe ma sold it gave me lessons inOperating it without extra charge I couldBee through it like a hole in a board fenceAll you had to do was simply to whirl alittle wheel-a-ma-gig around until a certain figure pointed to the hour on the dialthe one which you wished to be bouncedout at and everything was sereneI bought that clock in tho evening unbeknown to my family and thinking Ihad a sweet sure thing on being awakened at the proper hour I lingered withsoim1 friends in front of a julep reservoirBo it was past 10 when I got home andeverybody was asleepMy angelic mother-in-law had escapedthe perils of smallpox cholera etc andhad arrived that day to stay with us fora few days Heaven what a number ofdays it takes to constitute a few withthat mother-in-lawWell her long journey had tired her outand she too had gone to bed Enteringsoftly I deposited my clock on the tablethat stood at the head of our bed Then IBet her after which I carefully placedmyself horizontally in my little bed making no disturbance for I dislike lecturesand was soon lost to everything in theshape of fear or anxietyWhat a blessed thing deep is especiallywin n you are not afraid and know youare all right about getting up It will berved that I pause to n oralizeV ell 1 had really ot sleep on the brainI was tinctured with it clear throughit there is not the slightest use of moralizing or describing any further and I willcome to the point at oneIn the dead watch and middle of thonight I was rudely awakened by a

thatbed I felt something was looseAs soon as my senses were revived Ibeard the fearfulestmingled with the wild shouts and groansof my wife I was entirely confoundedmyself She yelled Murder Thieves IPolice and with tottering steps shemade for the adjoining bedroom whereher mother was I followed In terror myself for as yet I had not sufficiently cometo my senses to know what the deuce itwas all about anyhowThat mother-in-law leaped from herdreams from her bed and seeing metremblingly trying to quiet her daughtershe at once concluded that I was trying tomurder her and came for me tooth andnail Then I shouted then we all shoutedand the uproar was heard in the streetand murder was thought to be doingStill that awful racket was kept up inmy bedroom The truth flashed over mymind 1 had made a mistake in settingmy alarm clock and it had gone off Irushed wildly for it I placed it betweenthe feather bed and the mattress but stillit kept on with its devilish racket Thowomen also kept up theirs I seized thatclock and rushed to the bathroom andthere let a flood of water upon it in thehope of silencing it but all to no purposeWhile this confusion was going on within the police had rapped for assistance andhad gained admittance to the house Theyrushed up to our sleeping a artments andburst in the doorWhats up Whats the row Whereis hey said one of themMy mother-in-law pointed them to thebathroom where I was trying to drownthat confounded clock in a tub of waterThe officers drew their clubs and pkstolsand charged upon n e I mounted thetub and ointed to that clock which

chiefly due to thephenomenon of evaporation The majorityof liquids when left to themselves in contact with the atmosphere gradually passinto a state of vapor and disappearThe passage from the liquid into thegaseous state is accompanied by a greatloss of heat which is rendered latent bythe process of vaporisation Beyond thiswhen a substance is wet its conductingpower is increased and more heat is conveyed from the hand to the surfaceThis is easily explained The hand doesnot form a very perfect contact with a drysurfaee leaving a certain small amount ofair space between and air is a very badconductor of heat When the surface iswet however the contact is more exactand the water forms a good conductingmediumA Womnni ReasonShe sent my letter back unopcnqsVWivrShe said the postman who
