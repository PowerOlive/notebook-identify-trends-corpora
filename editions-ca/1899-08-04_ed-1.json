Eczema
The Only Cure
Eczema is more than a skin disease
and no skin remedies can cure it The
doctors are unable to effect a cure and
their mineral mixtures are damaging
to the most powerful constitution The
whole trouble is m the blood and
Swifts Specific is the only remedy
which can reach such deep seated blood
diseases
Eczema broke oat on my daughter and con
tinued to spread until
her head was entirely
covered She was treated
by several good doctors

dreadful disease spread

It was at the mntinee The eurtain hil
fallen upon a one act farce and the house
wrs darkened for the biojtraph
Two girls sat in the left hand box
chatting together Their faces shone
whitely in the half light The lines of
their profiles were so delicately fine that
many turned to look at them
Last night Mabel was saying 1
dreamed of muddy water I kept dream
ins of t al night long It came on and
on rolling up to my very feet The waves
were bi
afraid
turbulent threatening 1 was
A sin of trouble murmured Flor
ence that is unless it cleared Did it
dearr
Babel frowned She closed her fan and
tapped it impatiently against the palm of
her other hand
No it didnt she answered But
what difference did that make
When did you hear from Arthur
Arthur was Mabels soldier sweetheart
That is the trouble sighed Mabel 1
havent heard from him for ages but I
am expecting him home daily His regi
ment came last week but he was not
with it Perhaps he stopped somewhere
to rest It is a wonder they didnt all die
down there in that oven of a place
Then under her breath she added 1
hate that dream of muddy water
1 thought you didnt believe in
dreams exclaimed Florence
1 dont but
She was interrupted by the appearance
of Me and lack upon the canvas
There was a ripple of subdued laughter
as the little girl fell from the ropei int
the water the dog swimming coolly off
and leaving her there
Tic ure after picture was then prepar
ed There was the naval parade the
warships passing up the liudson the
yachts skimming swiftly in front of
them partially obstructing the view of
the sailors who stood like white statues
along their decks next Hobson walked
leisurely down the deck of a little cruis
er then a review of tae troops at Tampa
was announced
Perhaps it is Arthurs regiment that
is to be reviewed whispered Mabel
clasping her hands ecstatically together
Oh I hope so
There was a drumbeat and before a
dim vista of white tents the troops pass
ed in review
Their faces look sad said Florence
and they walk as if they were tired to
death
A white dog the mascot of the regi
ment occupied the center of the canvas
for a second a soldier following
A piece of paper floated along behind
Then came a row of six stalwart men
The man in frout suddenly turned his
face toward the audience He looked
straight at Mabel Uis eyes were hol
low and sad Intense weariness was
stamped upon every line of his gaunt
features
Mabel leaned eagerly forward She
laid hold of Florences arm
Look Florence she gasped Look
it is Arthur
In a moment the face was gone from
the canvas others had taken its place
the drum ceased to beat the review was
over and the canvas was dark again
Mabel was white to the lips She hur
riedly gathered up her belongings her
fan her handkerchief her opera glasses
What are you about asked Flor
ence The thing is not half over
I cant help it said Mabel I must
go now The heat in here is stifling I
cant stand it I must have the fresh
air
Outside she trembled so that Florence
took her arm
If I were you she said 1 should be
glad that I saw him Why do you wor
ry so
His eyes were hollow and sad stam
mered Mabel and his cheeks were thin
He looked so tired so dead tired Oh
Florence suppose he is very ill sup
pose oh remember my dream
Florence affected an overwhelming sur
prise
I thought you didut believe in
dreams said she
I dont I dont Who but an idiot
would believe in such rank foolishness
but you cant help thinking
Oh yes ron can Come wo will take
car and 1 will see you home my
self Dont be silly
By the time they reached the house
Florence had coaxed the girl into some
thing like her old ga ety She laughed
at a bit of her n insense as they ran up
the steps together
They passed into the hall On a little
tabic reserved for cards lay a letter
Mabel took it up and held it between
her forefinger and thumb It was old
and yellow A dozen postmarks disfig
ured the face of it upou which there was
no stamp
Florence took it from her
I will open it for you she said
Mabel sank upon her knees on the
carpet She remained there trembling
her white face clasped between her slen
der bloodless fingers
She saw once more the tired face on
the canvas the weary limbs dragging
laggingly along the hollow eyes peer
ing straight into hers in all the sadness
of a last farewell
For before Florence could read
contents of the letter her hoart
guessed the truth Criterion
the
had
Call for it insist on getting it
