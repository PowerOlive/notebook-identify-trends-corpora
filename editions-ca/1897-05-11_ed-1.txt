7 The presidentThursday sent to the senate a messagein response to a resolution asking- forall information in the department ofstate concerning tariffs taxes exportsand imports and in fact everythingconnected with commerce The message transmits a letter from the secretary of state transmitting suchinformation as has heeu furnished-the bureau of statistics through consular reports lbis hinted that the bureau has not hadadequate funds to print 211 themation which has been received andthe secretary suggests that larger appropriations be made for enlarging thework of the statistics bureauMr Dingley chairman of the waysand means committee of the househad a long consultation with PresidentMcKinley Thursday afternoon presumably about the tarift bill MrDingley declined to say anything aboutthe subject of his visitMr Calhoun the Illinois attorneywho has been selected by the president to take the place of Mr Day ofCanton as the legal representative ofthis government in the prosecution ofthe Ruiz case in Havana was at thestate department Thursday to beginthe preparation of his case lie spentsome time with Assistant SecretaryRockhill making himself acquaintedivith what has already been done byConsul General Lee and the department of stateDon T S Sharretts president ofthe board of United States general appraisers at New York has been summoned to Washington to advise thesenate committee on finance in relation to the tarift bill Avas askedThursday for an opinion in regard tothe merits of the amended bill as arevenue producer and in reply saidIn my opinion the bill will producesufficient revenue to meet the demandsof the government The duty on teawill aggregate a least 10000000while the increase iprovided for by thetax on beer will amount to from 12000000 to 14000000 more The increased duty on sugar will result in amaterial gain to the volume ofrevenue over that produced by theact of 1894 Indeed this increase alone would be almost sufficientif times were prosperous to producethe additional revenue necessary tosupport the government as the deficiency under that act was due largely to the depressed conditions 1 estimate the increase of the duty on sugarover that of the Wilson law to amounton the average to about 05 per cent Idp not believe that the increased ratewill materially affect the volume ofimportationsThere will also be a large additionfrom wool 1 think the increase fromthis source will exceed the possible decrease from the manufactures of wooldue to the rates being prohibitive onthe lower grades of woolen mixedrocds The cotton schedule showsvery little change from the Wilson lawand the same may be said of the metalflax and sundries schedules I saythat the increased revenue on the articles included in these scheduleswould not exceed 5000000Representative King democrat ofUtah Thursday introduced a resolution for the annextion of Hawaii Theresolution declares that citizensof the United States some ofwhom

action onthe arbitration treaty has created anunusual condition of affairs There isno official information that the senatehas taken any action or that thetreaty has been rejected or that thedefeated treaty was different from theone originally submitted All that isknown officially is that a treaty wasconcluded by Secretary Olney and SirJulian Pauncefote and sent to the senate It then went into executive session so that no official informationhas been given as to theamendments made and final actiontaken The secrecy of executive session does not permit the state department or the British

intcthe possibilities of getting theship up the canals connecting thelakes with the ocean arid alscinto the stipulations of the treatyof Washington to ascertain whetheror not the latter would stop the entryof the Yantic into the lakes if shewere dismantled of her guns Thedoctrine laid down during the last administration of President Clevelandin the face of an earnest brief in thenegative by his friend Don Dickinsonwas so broadly adverse to the construction of anything in the semblance cf a warship on the lakesthat there is no doubt that thepresent application would be included in its inhibition although it isof course possible that the present administration may take a different viewof the matter However the case isnot likely to go that far inasmuch asthe construction bureau has reportedthat even if all movable weights areremoved from the Yantic she couldnot be brought up to a draft of ninefeet and so could not pass the canalsWashington May 8 The questionof transit of mails

porte is inclined to support thepowsrs with a view to the facilitationof negotiations hut it declines to consent to an armistice on the groundthat chis would enable Greece to reorganize her forcesAs a matter of fact Turkey continues to send troops from Salonica homeward and it is probable that OsmanPasha has returned to Constantinoplefrom Salonica In view of both factsit may be assumed that nothing serious is expected but the continuanceof a state of war is regarded as thevery best means of hastening the efforts of diplomacyIt is understood that Greece agreesto confide her interests to the

shabby old fashioned train onewhose cars had seen service and notn little of it during the long- and eventful war so recently closed It had abaggage car behind the wheezy oldwood burner that drew the ricket profession out into the dim starlit aisleThrough the eastward forest and fortthe first time in a week that baggagear contained a trunk It had a smoker in which three or fouv negroes weresoundly sleeping on the worn cushionsst the forward end and three or fourlank shabbily dressed whites were consuming tobacco and killing time underthe single lamp at the other ft had aladies car so called in which noladies were visible and which differedin appointments from the smoker onlyin the facts that its scats were upholstered in dingy red plush instead ofblackened canvas and that both itslamps could be induced to burn however feebly instead of only one It wasa forlorn hangdog shame faced sortof train that seemed oppressed with asense of its own disrepute a train thatJept in hiding during

harm On the 15th however thewind and sea had greatly increased andthe waves were flung higher and highertoward that tower in the air Yet ailthought they surely could not reach60 feet above the

at supper one eveningIn response to our inquiries he described the lake as occupying the bottom of a deep and almost circular rockybasin the sides of which were so precipitous that there was only one placeflown which a horseman could descendThe bottom of the lake he explainedwas covered with a crust of salt fromsix inches to a foot in thicknessBut the queerest part of it all is thecrater It stands at one side of the biglake an forms a part of the shoreWhen vou gel to the rim of it von findyourself standin on the edge of a bigfunnel shaped hole about 200 feet deepan right down at the bottom of that isa little lake so deep nobody has everfound a bottom to itOur curiosity was strongly excitedfind before we turned in for the nightit was unanimously decided to pay aisit to the strange lake next daySunrise found lis in the saddle anda toilsome ride of two hours durationbroughtus to the object of our search-Weird and ghastly are the only termswhich properly describe the scene thatgreeted our eyes as we reined in ourpanting horses At our feet lay anenormous basin of perhaps 1000 acresin extent and some 70 or SO feet in depthits precipitous sides garnished withmasses of volcanic rock some of themso grotesque in shape as to appear almost unearthly At the bottom of thebasin and occupying the greater partof its area slumbered a lake of dazzlingwhiteness its shores encrusted withcurious formations of salt from whichthe suns rays were reflected in glittering lightOn the eastern shore about a halfmile from where we stood an enormousmound in shape like an inverted washbowl towered to a heightof 200 feet ormore and this we at once recognized asthe crater of which Winston had spokenDark and forbidding it reared itsmighty shape like an outcast from theinfernal regions its grim aspect seeminq to accentuate the awful silence thatbrooded over the sceneThey say the Apaches Navajos andZnnis have a superstition about the erasomething like reverence by the sublime picture of desolation spread outbefore us They imagine an evil spiritlives in the little lake at the bottom anthat he emits thunder an lightninwhenever he gets mad at anvbodv Iveheard thev wont kill even a white manin the basinGuided by Winston we rode down thesteep trail that led to the bottom of thebasin and established our camp neara little spring that bubbled out of therocks opposite to live crater It was theonly fresh water in the vicinity butthere were no signs to indicate that ithad lately been visited by man or beastFilling our canteens and watering thehorses we were ready to commence theascent of the craterArrived at the summit we at oncesaw that Winstons description had notocen overdrawn At our feet yawnedi great funnel shaped hole at thetorn of which twinkled a mmature lakeits hue of brightest emerald contrasting strangely with the darly scoria ofthe craters sidesWith many turns aud twists andmuch unavoidable sliding Ave descendedto the shore of the lake and seating ourselves on fragments of lava spent halfan hour in endeavoring to account fortlie presence of such a jewel in so incongruous a settingThey say the water is so thick withsalt that a feller cant sink in it remarked WinstonDid you eier test it I askedNo sir ree You couldnt hire me toA4rswim across the fathomless abyss in thecenter Its ragged circumference seendistinctly many feet -below the sufacesuggested the rivenous jaws and gaping maw of a monster of the Cjclopeanworld lying in wait for whatever unwary creature might venture into itsvicinity I caught myself wonderinghow I should feel if some mighty forcewere suddenly to seize and drag medownward and I had almost succeededin working myself into a state of gemiine fright when a shout from the rimof the crater diverted my thoughts intoa more sensible channelAfter watching our aquatic sportsfor a few minutes Winston -had ascendedto the crest of the mound where I nowcaught sight of him lying flat on theinner edge of the crater and excitedlygesticulating to us To scramble intoour clothes was the work of a few moments and we climbed up the steep tohis sideHe did not Avait for us to ask for an explanation of his call Pointing to thebluffs on the northern side of the basinhe ejaculated the single word Lookleaving us to observe and draw our ownconclusions from what we sawIndians and a big bunch of emcried Baker who was the first to glancein the indicated directionTheres just 19 of em said HarrisIf they are hostiles and discover usDiscover ns interrupted HinmanHow can they help discoverin us whentheyll strike our sign the minute theystart down in to the basinIf they failed to see our sign theycouldnt very well overlook that bunchof saddled bosses standin at the foot ofthe hill said Winston arising andstarting downthe path at a rapid paceWe cant afford to let em get theoutfit he said as we overtook him atthe bottom so well just lead thebosses tp the bottom of the crater andfind standin room for em on the insideThe suggestion was adopted Mounting our horses we drove the pack animals to the bottom of the ascent andsent them all up the winding path at apace that must have astonished themsince heretofore they had good reasonto regard us as men merciful to theirbeastsSecuring the horses to blocks of lavaon the inner slope which afforded isomewhat precarious footing for themwe again centered our attention uponthe causes of our disquietude Theywere riding along- at the same slow trotas when first seen and were now withinJ 00 yards of the trail leading down tothe basin which it was evidently theirintention to enterAll doubt as to the warlike mission ofour visitors was removed as they descended into the basin and followed ourtrail toward the spring at a long swinging slope The absence of women children and dogs their painted faces andthe fighting trim of their scanty habiliments proclaiming them a Avar partyoi Apaches while the confidence withwhich they advanced unquestionablyindicated that they had already gathered from the trail an approximate ideaof our numbers and characterThey seemed to consult together fora few minutes and one of them finallystopped out of the group and advancedto the foot of our stronghold holdinghis hands above his head with the palmsto the front as a sign of his amicable intentionsBuenas dias amigos he hailed inSpanish with which language the sowthwestern Indians are generally conversantThey know were- here an we mightas well talk to remT said HirimrtnNo tfne objecting he rose to his feetand answered the salutation of thedusky herald in the tongue in which itwas givenBuenas diasGood morningQue qui ere usteelWhat do you wantI understood Spanish sufficiently wellto enable me to follow the conversationthat ensued and I knew enough of Indian diplomacy not to be particularlysurprised by the heralds- propositionson behalf of his- very hospitable compatriots These involved nothing lessthan the turning ovw of our hoxses

signal for hostilities tocommence No sooner had he communicated the result of his mission totiie band than three of them drove theponies up the trail to the mesa wherethey could graze secure from our

onthe sand while another scrambled tocover with a halting motion that indicated a serious weakness in one of hisextremitiesAfter this lesson no further active hostilities were indulged in by either sideWe were careful to keep well undercover they commanded the water supply and we were willing to play a waiting gameWhen the sun dipped below the horizon we separated taking stations atsuch points around the crest as wouldbest enable us to command the entireouter circle of ascent The horses weresecured anew and we settled down toa night of anxious alertnessSeveral hours passed without incident

loadedwith explosives up a dangerous ascentin the darkness prompted me morestrongly to leave him where he washowever and I contented myself withslipping down to him and ascertaining that he was securely tiedThe atmosphere had been very heavyand sultry all the afternoon and I wasnot surprised to see the heavens givingeverv indication of a storm before midnight which augured ill for the
