Chairman Willsan's letter to thegrowers follows:"To the tobacco growers of Fayette,Bourboi., Bath, Montgomery, Clark,Maaison, Garrard, Lincoln, Boyle, Anderson, Washington, Woodford, Scottand Jessamine counties:"By request of the District Boardof the Burley Tobacco Union, I desireto notify you uf the demands made onthe Burley Tobacco Union by the Executive Committee of the Burley Tobacco Society."Their refusal to endorse a cut-outof the 1911 crop was based upon theground that e had not made enoughEhowing of strength in the above named counties."I do not regard their demands asto the countiies of Scott. Clark andAnderson seriously, for the simplereason that we have always considered those counties as old pool counties,and in fact we did not make an effortto sign them on a cut-out pledge, aswe figured that they would swing intoline with other pool counties. Youwill also notice Montgomery and Bathin their list. 1 am sure the Executive Committee of the Burley TobaccoSociety overlooked the wonderfulshowing made in those counties onsigned pledges for the cut-out of the1911 crop."I truly feel that the counties ofFayette, Madison, Garrard, Lincoln,Boyle, Woodford and Jessamine shouldmake a better showing of signed pledges and in accord with my instructions,I hereby respectively request you tomeet at your respective county seatson saturuny, reoruary n, at :auo'clock to take up such action and signenough pledges to enable us -to put itup to the Burley Tobacco Society fortheir endorsement before it is everlastingly too late to save any interest inthe 1909 or 1910 holdings."Gentlemen, I truly believe that thepeople in the old pool counties want tohelp in this fight and will do so just assoon as they know the growers in theindependent counties have signed areasonable number of pledges. AgainI urge each county to take such interest as to bring up your county to yreasonable figure or per cent at once.Kindly write or phone my office forfurther information. Our number is1416, both phones."Respectfully submitted,"BRADLEY WILSON,"Chairman Campaign Committee."MITCHELL fiunmflanTOGARDSThe most luxurious accessory in existance.

Wewill not invade any of the old poolcounties for pledges, and will leavethe rpult of the campaign of the nextfew days to determine the decision ofthat body. Bourbon county is holdingback and we will not push the matterhere, but when the time comes I amlooking for her to fall in line with therest. Pledges from independent counties are coming in rapidly and at ourmeeting in Lexington on February 20,we will most certainly make a convincing showing.33FRANK & CO;The Ladies' Store.Announce,Ready For Your InspectionNew Spring StylesINHigh-Class Artists Secure.Tho Skovgaard Concert Companywill give a concert at the City SchoolAuditorium, Monday night, February27, under the auspces of the ladiea ofthe Baptist church.

However this cise will be appealed.Suits emanating from both Frankfort and Paris to prevent the absorption of the F. & C. by the L. & N., instituted by shippers and business menof both cities have been pending forseveral months and the decision ofJudge Benton from a legal point givesthe L. & N. the right to come into legitimate possesion of Ihe F. & C.The case was stubbornly contestedand both sides were represented byable counsel. The decision of JudgeBenton, it is said, caused some surprise, owing to the fact that the F. &C. was regarded as a parallel and competing line, but the opinion of JudgeBenton is contrary to such contention,and the merging of the roads cannotaffect the existing freight rates.F. & C. Extension. -It is the purpose of the Louisville &Nashville railroad, according to the information that has been given out andwhich is being discussed by officials ofthe road, to improve the line of theFrankfort & Cincinnati and make it apaying proposition. It is very evidentthat for some years it has been underthe cuntrol of the L. & N., but not until recently was there a move in thedirection of taking the road over andmaking it a part of the L. & N. system. Since the construction of the Kentucky Midland it has proven a losingproposition to its operators and had itnot been for the courtesies extended itby connecting lines, it is said by thosewho are in a nosition to know the rn:id, would have been abandoned years ago.Ihe physical condition of the road hasnever been such as to make it a com' peting line and it was the purpose ofthe L. & N., when it absorbed the: road to improve it to a point of ef!Iciency, extend the line into rich territory, making it a valuable asset to thepartfof the country through which itis to pass.and vhich will beyond a single doubt prove of the greatest benefitto Paris and Bourbon county., North 31i(l(Uetovn on Lino.If the plans discussed by the railroadI officials are actuated, little townsalong the original route surveyed forthe Kentucky Midland, that have beenclangoring lor railroads through the un, opened territory, will have , theiri dreams transfomed into reality. ForI a number of years North Middletown,1 in this county, has been a contendingbidder for all lines that have been proposed and several surveys for interurban roads have been made. Nothinghas resulted from the large amount ofi talking that has been done, but NorthMiddletown is still making an effort tosecure a road through that territorywhich is conceded to be 'the richest inagriculture of any of the precincts inBourbon county.uy cuming into me legal possessionof the Frankfort & Cincinnati and ifthe L. & N. can without being molested by the courts assume control of theline, it is their plan, according I to thewell founded rumor, to extend the linto North Middletown, giving this portion of the county transportationfacilities that have been so longsought, through Sharpsburg and intoMorgan countv, opening up a vast territory in that part of the state richwith coal and mineral ores.Paris the L. AL- E. Terminal.Aside from this the L. &. N. ulans toI spend the sum in excess of three mil-lion dollars in improving the Lexington. & Eastern railroad, extending the lineI into Jackson county and Eastern Kentucky coal .fields. Based upon the, same reliable information it is also the, plan of the L. & N. to make Paris theterminal of the L. & E. road and alltraffic from points on tne road will, come to Paris for transportation to thesouth and East.Should this he put into efl'pct the carshops of the L. & E., located in Lexington, and the ;majority Lof the employes ot the road will ;be transferredto Paris, which will mean a substantial increase in the population of thecity and merchants in all branches willI e benefitted as a result.At the present time it is estimatedthe pay-roll of the Louisville & .Nashville railroad in this city amounts inthe aggregate to the sum of $60,000monthly. fWhile the figures quoted arenot authentic it is intended to give afair idea of the amount the corporation pays to its employes all of whomwith very tew exceptions areently located in this city.the remaiein Hoe spaee will fccatttfoed for freightThe work of replacing tlie Kielbridge spanning Houston 'creek is pregreieing rapidly and about thirty -ftmen have been actively engaged oc the .structure for several weeks. Fertvcar loads of steel will bepaced in theDridge. It Is expected it will be completed by the first of May and vvillcost the rail load company in theneighborhood of 100.000. jTrain Shed Will Be Erected.Contractors, who have the yarda inSouth Paris under construction, hopeI to finish the immenes undertakingwithin three weeks. Fourteen tracks! have been completed that extend fromthe Claysville crossing to the junction,a distance of several hundred yards.while ethers to the round-house, watertank turn-tables will bring the total tothe number of twenty-five. With thisincrease in track-roum it will be possible to lhandle the large amount ofrolling stock that has preiously congested the yards. This improvementt3 the local yards has involved an expenditure of $250,000.In the spring the railroad company,it is said, has under consideration theerection of a train shed that will extend from the crossing on Winchesterstreet to the office of TrainmasterChambers, a distance of more than fivehundred feet. The space betweenthe tracks will be laid in concrete andpassenger trains arriving will be arranged on the tracks according to theirlength, the shortest train on the firsttrack, that passengers, in transferringfrom one train to the other, will notbe compelled to pass over the platforms to reach then trains which willlessen the chances of accidents andprove a convenience to the travelingpunlic.Number of Trams Increase.The amount of passenger traffic fromthis point from January 1 to Kebiuary1, shows an immense increase over thesame period of last year, which islargely cue to the transportationfacilities the road is extending. Atpresent there are forty-eight passenger trains arriving and departing fromParis daily, which, compared with thecity of Louisville, shows a greaternumber. Together with the numberof freight trains that arrive and departbrings the total to the number of sixtytrains and should Paris become the L.& E. treminus this number will be increased. It is stated that all fast trains fromthe North will be detoured by way ofLexington and over the L. & E. toWinchester, striking the main line atthat point, and trains from the Southwill leave the main line at Winchesterfor Lexington and thence to Paris.Paris Should Hefp.These facts are intended to give thereader an insight to what the Louisville & Nashville railroad is .doing forParis. Thousands of dollars are pucinto circulation each month in thiscity, a large majority of which goes tothe merchantsof Paris. The immenseamount of money expended by thecompany un its improvements heregives evidence Uhat the company intends to make this city the center ofthe division, which will necessarily increase the proserity of Paris.With the proper encouragement theL. & N. would no douot be ready tomeet thp demands of the people ofParis and in view of approach of theseason when improvements of otherproperty in this city will begin, ihecitizens should demonst'ate a co-operativespirit and encourage any mtjve-ment that will in the slightest degreebenefit Paris.Police Court.In Police Court yesterday OscarJackson, colored was fi ned SJ2.50 fordrunk and .disorderly conduct.

It is singular howthose can be found to do such work,especially since an ignominious deathis the penalty for being caught. Thestrangest feature of the spy systemis that the more delicate woman shouldhave done her share in it.One day a girl about twenty-fouryears old went to Allan Pinkerton,who was r.t the head of the UnitedStates secret service bureau, and toldhim that she had lived at IUchmpnd,the capital of the Confederacy, andwas supposed to be a secessionist. Sheproposed to go there, intending to offerher services to the Confederate government, to return to "Washington andtake back information to Richmond.In other words, by pretending to bein the Confederate service she honedto get information of their intentions Ior condition for the Federal govern- jment. She said her object was tomake money to lift her sick mother jout of poverty. ,Pinkerton set several traps for her lin order to test her Odelity to theFederal cause and, having satisfiedhimself of it, sent her to Mr. Lincoln. 'This -v as in 1SG4, when the strugglewas drawing to a close. The workMr. Lincoln gave her to do was to dis-1cover what commissary stores were inRichmond and -what further supplies,could be obtained.Kate Eeale went to Richmond, goingthrough the lines without much !trouble. Her accent, which she hadacquired in the south, was distinctlysouthern and a ?rreat help to her. Shewormed herself into the confidence ofthe wife of an important officer In theConfederate commissary departmentand asked him if there was not someplan by which she could assist southern sympathizers in the north inrunning eatables into the south. Hetold her there were only two ways,by blockade running and by getting avessel to some spot of southern territory unwatched by northern troops.She proposed to start an expeditionon the last named plan.She was taken to President Davisand to the commissary general. Shetold them that she knew southern menin Baltimore who would run suppliesthrough if sure they would be metby a southern force. After much discussion a point was named where supplies might be landed.During these discussions the spylearned that if Grant succeeded intalcing Petersburg, all supplies beingcut off from the south, the troops andneonle of Richmond had almost noprovisions whatever to rely upon. Thesurrender must follow very soon. Cured by the Marvel of theHaving gained the information she L, ddd T.jrwished for, MKs Beale made her prep-J t-GntUiy, D. t.

An unusual and ratheramusing incident of this was recently given in Los Angeles.J. B. Morrow, who owns an Inter-State, left the car alongsidethe sidewalk, thinking he had shut off the motor. A shortcircuit, however, kept the engine running, but so quietly thatMorrow did not detect it. A number of the Los Angeles policeforce coming up the sidewalk also thought the motor dead, andin order to grab a moments repose leaned up against the car'shood. He then detected a slight vibration, made investigationand found the motor running most industriously. He arrestedMorrow for leaving the engine running for over a half hour onthe street.

Helooked at her with a. pair of steel grayeyes under bushy eyebrows and withu more than ordinary inteiost. She didnot remember ever having seen himbefure, but considering her mission shefelt sure she was in d.mger.She pretended not to notice theman's interest in her. Walking on, butwithout turning to see if ho followedher, she spied an empty cab. Reckoning to the driver, lie pulled up at thecurb, and she entered, telling him todilve her to the presidential mansion.As she was driven away she saw theman still looking at her. but pretending not to notice her. When she stopped at the president's home and alighted the man came hurrying up. Shewent in and asked for Mr. Davis. Hewas busy at the time; but, having waited awhile to see him, she went away.When she passed out of the door theman -with the bushy eyebrows had disappeared. Apparently her bluff gamehad succeeded. jRut she dare not remain in Rich- 'mond a minute longer. Not daring togo directly northward, she coucludedto first go south and told the cabman jto drive her to the battlefields that 'had been fought on by Lee and McClellan two years before, and, arrivingthere, she dismissed him.Hiring vehicles where she could,walking where sire could not hirethem, sometimes floating in a stolenboat on the James river, she at lastreached Fortress Munroe, in possession of the Federal forces. There shefound a naval transport about to leavefor the north and. reaching New York,took a train for Washington.When the name of Kate Beale wastaken up to Mr. Lincoln he muttered a"thank God" and directed that sheshould be immediately conducted tohim. "When she entered!' the roomwhere he was and he arose to greether it seemed to her that his tall, lankfigure would never cease rising. Hetook both her hands in his, and his expressive eyes told her how relieved liewas to see her."I have Important news for you, Mr.Lincoln," she" said, and she told himwhat she had learned.It was but a, month after that thatGrant took Petersburg and the Confederacy collapsed.Kate Reale was paid a large sumfrom the secret service fund, withwhich she ministered to her mother'swants.

A. MITCHELCopyright by American Press Association. 1911.J was born with a head of fiery redhair. As a kid I remember peoplelooking at it as they would at a burning barn, making all kinds of allusionsto my hair and countless jokes, manyof them very poor and in bad tasteand all obnoxious to me.When I grew old enough to have asweetheart I was obliged to go without one, all on account of the growthon my head. I kept it cut very short,but without effect. Just as soon as Icame in contact with man, woman orchild I saw at once that my hair wasagainst me. One thing I would not doI refused all barbers who suggestedmy permitting them to dye it On entering their shops I would say, "Haircut; no dye." Whenever, after this notice, a barber offered to give my hair adifferent color I glared at him and toldhim that if he rencated the offer hemust fight. I thrashed so many people !for reference to my blemish that I became an expert boxer.Doping that the people of the westwore more considerate than those ofthe east, I went to Denver. The firstsalute I received there was: "Hello,carrot top! Y goin' to set the timberon the mountings afire?" I had gottired of thrashing people and turnedaway without a word. I sought employment in a large manufacturingconcern. On entering the office my eyeslighted on a gentleman sitting at adesk who had red hair, for all theworld as red as mine. lie looked up,and in an instant his gaze was fixed onmy top.He arose from his chair and, advancing to the office rail, grasped myhand in a viselike grip.'My dear sir," he said warmly andwith a respectful mien 1 had never before been favored with,, "what can Ido for you?""I'm seeking employment.""You shall have it right here. "Whatcan you do?""Nothing. I must learn. But I'mwilling to work without pay till I do.""You'll not work without pay here.Judging from your appearance, youare well bred and educated. A man ofyour condition can't get on with lessthan a hundred dollars a month. I'llgive you that and put you in our bestdepartment. Mr. Stamper!" he called.An employee advanced, and I noticed he, too, had a red head, ne wasinstructed to put me to work and onthe payroll at the same time. As Ipassed through the works I noticedevery man had a red head, but noneso red as mine and the manager's.Ours was the same hue exactly."You'll be shoved up ahead of usall," said the man who had taken mein charge."Why so?" I asked."You're the only man here who hasas red hair as the president."The words proved true. I was jumped from one grade to another so fastthat I barely had time to learn theduties in each. And every time Ijumped my salary jumped too.This was not all. Mr. Flynn, thepresident and principal owner, askedme one day to come to his house todinner. I went, of course, and wasintroduced to his family. Every oneof his children had red hair of variousshades. His oldest daughter, Emily,had veritable Titian locks. For thefirst time In my life I felt easy insocial company. For the first time nota person about me looked at my head,much less referred to it Miss EmilyFlynn was very gracious to me andwas the first young woman who hadever thus treated me so. I was happyas a clam at high tide. After dinnershe led me into a separate parlor, andI spent the hours there chatting withher. They were thus far the happiesthours of my life. I left her with awildly beating heart.To make a long story short, MissFlynn encouraged me and I encouragedMiss Flynn. One day she told me Imight go to her father and ask forher. I did so and was accepted for ason-in-law with great gusto. "Go backto Em," he said, "and tell her youhave my hearty consent, and remainto dinner."I spent the afternoon with Emilyand dined with the family. After dinner Mr. Flynn said to me:"You have shown wonderful restraint in not asking why I have welcomed you into my business and intomy family. The time has come forme to enlighten you."Years ago I came to this countryfrom Ireland without a cent andworked at any job I could get in agroat city. One day I was arrested,accused of stealing from a Jew. Hehad told the police that a red headedIrishman had robbed him. I was stoodIn line with several other men, andthis Jew picked me out as the manwho had robbed him. I was tried, andthe evidence was strong against me.1 was about to be convicted when ared headed man strolled in among thespectators. My attorney, following asuggestion given by the man's redhair, called for him and placed himbeside me. Then he sent for the Jewand when he came into court askedhim which of the two had robbed him.The Jew couldn't tell. He had simplyidentified me because the man whohad robbed Mm -had a red head. Thejury acquitted me at once."'God bles.s red headed men!' I exclaimed. 'From this day they are allmy bosom friends."And it ha always been my wishto have a red headed 'son-in-law aadh. ta-progenitor .of "Ke&rat!ooa -!reCbeaded dccendat."GdnstipstiMCore FritWith' the first signs of comtifation you resort to the home Ketfcofeof relief, such as hot or cold water cmarising, lots of stewed fruit with yoarbreakfast, etc., but what do yom 4mwhen these fail?The majority then start oa aatts aaslpurgative waters, then chaace to ritaar11c puis, etc it you nave goa tMthese various stages you kaow taeymi useless, so iar as permaaent 1go.
