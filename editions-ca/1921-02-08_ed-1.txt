The offerings weremedium, only a few crops of muchmeiit being on . Ihe (market. Thebet sale of the day was a crop of1,080 pounds, belonging to Caywood& Crouch, which brought an averageof 526.41. .Following" the sales held at theBourbon Warehouse, Thursday, theNew Independent Tobacco Warehouse Co. sold a total of 169,850pounds of tobacco for $25,043.29,an average of $14.75. The best saleof the day was a crop of 5,875pounds, belonging to Howard '&Barnhill. which brought anaver -age of $24.09.Sales were resumed Friday at theBourbon Tobacco Warehouse, wherea total of 226,550 pounds went under Ihe hammer for a total of $30,929.35, an average of $13.65. Thequality of the offering was verypoor. Many growers are againliauling low grade tobacco to themarket with the result of muchlower averages. The best average inthis sale was on a crop of 2,790pounds belonging to Hancock &tiase, which sold forxan average of$31.05.Insurance companies which writepolicies on farm crops have reducediheir liability on tobacco in CentralKentucky to $100 an acre, according to announcement jmade at theBuriey tobacco belt. The loweringof the valuation was made as a result of tbf prices brought for theli)20 crop. When :he insurance wasoriginally written, companies permitted valuations as high as $300and $400 on acre based on the pricefor the 1919 crop.Belief that the movement to 'cutout the 1921 tobacco crop is a deadRsue, and that the Buriey TobaccoGrowers incorporated, the organization formed with the avowed purpose of fostering the cut-out movement, wili never call a meeting forthe election of a head following therefusal of J. N. Kehoe to serve inthat capacity, wa expressed byFrank McKee," of Versailles, whowas tempoiary chairman of the organization wrhile it was being formed. "It is impossible to enforce acut-out program with the prpbentcrop being sold," Mr. McKee said,adding thnt such, an attempt wouldbe like the old precaution of locking the stable doo? after the hordeis stolen. He said that pledge cardshad been sent out through the Burley districr and many growers hadfeigned them, but that they were notto be considered binding unlessseventy pei cent of the growerswould sign up and he indicatedthat he did not believe that manycould be induced to sign with thepresent crop being sold.MAYSVILIE BOYS' BANDLEXINGTON PAIR.ATThe famous Boys' Band, of Maysville, will play fo the Blue GrassFair, at Lexington, -the week beginning September 5, during the greatannual exhibition there.The band twU arrive Sunday before the fair opens and will give aconcert hat night.The contract has been signed byJ.

It mayhave been his own fault. He mayhave been too "fair" with his patrons and not fair enough with himself.

And he is right.Even though there is a generalfalling market, prices will for several years remain at a higher levelthan before the war. The printeiand publisher will have to pay morefor the things he has to buy forhimself, his family and his business.and it is therefore right for him to ;ask and receive better prices foiwhat he has to sell, and lay a newfoundation that will hold' up Jusbusiness structure under the newconditions which will assail it.These who have not already doneso should lose no time to protectthemselves in this matter. And thoseprinters and publishers who ha-vebeen able to establish a price levelfair to themselves and their customers should be deaf to importunities for a reduction.It is to the shame of hundreds ofcommunities all over the countrythat the local papers and printingplants have been sufficient for theproprietor to continue them andmaintain self-respect as a citizenand a business man.

But take the Standard Dictionary definition, "An intimate and trustworthy companion,"and make your own list of companions both trustworthy and intimate. Will it shows a score?The word has been hammered thinj by usage until, as commonly employed, it applies to every acquaintance to whom one is amiably disposed to his neighbors, business,,church and club associates, boyhoodcompanions, and college chupis. Yetevery man knows there is a distinction between an agreeable acquaintance and a friend alike in fairweather and foul. More reluctantly, men admit ftib distinction between theiV friends and those otherswhom they see, but rarely and yetwhom they value, turn to instinctively in their own troubles and.count it a privilege to help shouldthey need it. These are trustworthycompanions but not intimate. Theymay be called potential f rinds.Some men have any nujmber of in-! timate companions, others apparently few. But nature has a wayor redressing the balances. Often ithappens that the silent, rather aloofman finds when trouble comes thatmany have been wishing him well,taking systematic note of his goings"and comings, unconsciously approving his deeds, and are eager to setvehim in his need. A (mans actualfriends may be less than a score,but the number and voltage of hispotential friends are among the finest facts of life.A fT0-MQTHER!"California Syrup of Figs":Child's Best Laxativevmii:&&hW HHfcsMYES IT CAN BEDYED OR CLEANEDThat last year's suitor dress can be made to appear like a New- OneSend Via Parcel Post.SWISS CLEANERS & DYERS909 6th Strt (incorporated) Louisville, Ky.e? it 7gwimtimiiHiHiiiiiiiiin iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiuniiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitnimWilliam K.
