R. M. CALDWELL.
Miss Mary McDaniel entertained
a number of her lady friends Fri
day afternoon in honor of the ap
proaching nuptials of Miss Mary
Louise Bruce, who is soon to be
come the wife of Mr. James Patter
son Lail, of Paris.
The protracted meeting which
has been in progress at the Presby
terian church for the past two weeks
conducted by Dr. Thacker, closed
Sunday night. The meeting was one
of the best ever conducted in Mil
lersburg. More than four hundred
people signed the pledge cards given
out during the meeting, and all of
the churches' received a number of
additions on profession and by let
ter. Dr. Thacker das a method of
his own. His pleas were made
through the pledge card system.
These cards were given out at every
service, and non-church members or
those who desired to lead a better
life were urged to sign them. His
sermons in all of the meetings were
logical, practical and oratorial. The
good that Dr. Thacker did in Millers-
burg will be felt long after he has
p-nup from us and there are none
who heard him but who appreciate
his work, and wish him pronounced
success wherever he may go. The
song services were under the direc
tion of Mr. and Mrs. Harry P. Arm
strong, who go with Dr. Thacker.
They, like him, were zealous in their
work and brought out of the singing
people of Millersburg, all there was
in them. The choir and congrega
tion was so well trained during the
time they were with us, and so en
thusiastic at every service that their
voices rose in song in one grand ari
umphant unison. Dr. Thacker, Mr.
and Mrs. Mrs. Armstrong left Mon
day for Danville, where they began
another series of meetings Monday
night. We trust and pray that their
power of doing good may be felt and
appreciated there as much as it was
in Millersburg.
CLOTHING FOR THE ARMENI
ANS AND "SYRIANS.
Following the great world-war, the
distress in Armenia and Syria con
tinues unabated, and appeals are
constantly coming for aid from
America. The cry heard of old in
"Macedonia, "Help us or we perish!"
goes out now as it did then. Thous
ands of starving: and ragged Arme
nians and Syrians look to America
fo aid, for food and clothing, ana it
is not in the hearts of Americans to
deny them succor.
In this city the Relief Committee
having in charge the Armenian and
Syrian relief work, asks for dona
tions of old clothing, suitable for
men, women and children. These
donations can be left at C. B. Mitch
ell's store, where they will be "re
ceived and taken care of. The big
drive in the relief of these unfortu
nate and innocent victims of the
(cruelties of war will begin to-mor
row (Wednesday), October 15. Open
your hearts and your purees, and
help the Committee in any way you
can. Contributions of old clothes
are especially desired.

BOY BADLY BRUISED.
John Brooks Webber, young son of
Mr. and Mrs. Charles A. Webber, of
this city, sustained severe bruises
Saturday afternoon, when a large
truck wheel fell on him. Young
Webber was playing in the work
shop at the Bourbon Garage & Sup
ply Co., on Main street, of which his
father is proprietor, when the big
wheel, which had been removed from
a truck, fell over on him. He was
removed to the Massie Memorial
Hospital, where, after an examina
tion, he was found to have sustained
painful, but not serious injuries.
He was reported yesterday as getting
along very nicely.
In spite of the prohibition laws,
many a temperance woman still
continues to wear her corkscrew
curls.
