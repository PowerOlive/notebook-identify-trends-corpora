BARROW'S BODY RECOVERED.
s
After a search of twelve days the
body of David Barrow, Jr., of Lexing
ton, who was drowned in Lake Michi
gan, near Ludington, Mich., was
found Sunday morning by the life
savers' patrol, about five miles from
the point at which he lost his life.
The hody was taken to the station
and viewed by the authorities and
identified by Dr. Woolfolk Barrow, of
Lexington, beyond all doubt by means
of a scar from an operation for appen
dicitis, and one on the forehead from
a skating accident.
Dr. Woolfolk Barrow left yesterday
for Lexington with the body.
SUNBURN AND TAN.
One who comes back from a sum
mer vacation without what is com
monly called a good health tan is re
garded as not having taken full "ad
vantage of his opportunities. Most
people feel that in getting themselves
well tanned they have done some
thing meritorous, something that, in
an obscure way, is beneficial to their
health and well-being. So strong is
the superstition that people will some
sometimes vountarily submit their
arms and faces to painful sunburn,
and rejoice in the subsequent mahog
anizing of their skin. As a matter of
fact, there is no .special virtue in a
coat of tan. It is the protection that'
unaided nature attempts to supply to
the skin when it is attacted by the
damaging ultra-violet rays. It filters
the sunlight, and it that way weakens
or eliminates the force of the rays.
There is no reason for compelling na
ture to take theseNpreventive meas
ures. A sun hat of light brown or
green will perform the same service
more efficiently.
The ultra violefc rays have the merit
of destroying germs; but few persons
it may be believed, feel it necessary
to acquire a coat of tan for that pur
pose. '
In hot weather, it is well known,
the color of clothes is important. Cer
tain clothes heighten discomfort; others-
greatly reduce it. Anyone freely
exposed in very hot weather to the
red rays, is apt to suffer from over
excited nerves; in fact, to these rays
most cases of sunstroke may be at
tributed. Red clothing offers them
free passage, and is therefore not de
sirable. Blue is also undesirable, for
it offers no protection against the ultra-violet
rays. Green is of all col
ors the coolest and most restful. The
most comfortable rooms in hot weath
er are those decorated in green. They
have the fulther advantage of being,
for some reason, especially unattract
ive to the house fly. Youth's Companion.
Some of the girls in the extremely
tight skirts look nobby and others
look knobby.

LUKE McLUKE SAYS.
It is none of your business when a
man's hose supporters breaks. But it
is everybody's business if it happens
to be a girl.
Before marriage he sighs because
be can't get her. After marriage he
sighs because he can't get rid of her.
When Father was courting Mother
he used to stick around until the
milkman came. That's the reason
why Mother tells Daughter that no
Gentleman will stay later than 10
o'clock when he calls on a girl.
Practice may make perfect in other
things, but it doesn't seem to improve
the markmanship of tobacco chewers.
Diamonds and wine and limousines
may be luxuries. But don't forget that
a five-cent sandwich is also a luxury
if you only have four cents.
