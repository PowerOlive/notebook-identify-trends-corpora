Catai rh to
Consumption
tion Growing worse and worse each iL
winter those who rely upon the usual
treatment of sprays washes and j
ing mixtures find that it is impossible
to check the disea e with these local I
applications which only reach the j
face The offensive discharge increases
all the while and gets deeper until it is
only a question of s ort time when
the lungs are affected
The importance of the proper treat
ment can therefore b readily
ciated But no good whatever can be
expected from local applications as i
such treatment never did cure Catarrh
and never will Being a blood disease
of the most obstinate nature Swifts
Specific SSS is the only remedy
which can have the slightest effect upon
Catarrh It is the only blood remedy
that goes down to the bottom of all stub
born diseases which other remedies
cannot reach j
Mrs Josephine Polhiil of Due West j
S C writes i
I had such a severe case of
Catarrh that I lost my hearing in one j
ear and part of the bone in my nose
sloughed off I was constantly treated
with sprays and
washes but each
winter the disease
seemed to have a
firmer hold on me
I had finally been
declared incurable
when I decided to
try S S S It
seemed to get right
at the seat of the
me permanently
The experience of Mr Chas A Parr
of Athens Ga was like that of all
- others who vainly seek a cire in local
treatment He says
For years I suffered from a severe
case of Catarrh the many offensive
6ymptoms being ac
companied by severe
pains in the head I
took several kinds of
medicines recom
mended for Catarrh
and used various local
applications but they
had no effect whatev
er I was induced to
take SSS Swifts

perfectly well and have never felt any
effects of the disease since

Defective Paper Making
Fapr makers are discussing the pe
culiar fact that for many Genturies there
have been periodical investigations into
the deterioration of paper Recently
the Society of Arts in London appoint
ed a special committee to make an in
vestigation of this character Old rec
ords show that fault has been found
with the quality of paper in almost
every age and most qf the famous mu
seums and libraries in Europe have
specimens of pure g paper -which
show decay due to flaws in the texture

The Retired Burglar
I dont think I was ever very much
scared said the retired burglar but
I have been as much scared by slight
little things that were of no real ac
count as by anything else For in
stance by the scratching of a rat start
ing up suddenly and running around in
the wall I was never more disturbed
than I was once by the absolute still
ness of a room that I was in It was
dead and oppressive and I couldnt ac
count for it
I swung my lamp around and saw
the usual things that you might expect
to see in such a room it was a dining
rooni including a clock on the mantel
It was a pendulum clock one of the
kind that has a little clear space in the
lower part of the glass front through
which you can seethe pendulum as it
swings back and forth The lamp sim
ply swept across the face of the clock
as I swung it around but an instant
later I realized that I had seen no pen
dulum swinging back and forth behind
that clear space It wasnt swinging
The clock had stopped
I set my lamp oh the shelf and
Catarrh opened the door of the clock and started
up tne pendulum and then 1 heard the
regular ticking of the clock And that
was all that was wanted But what a
relief it was to hear it I could sort out
the spoons now with a cheerful spirit

Lady Pendulum
From the New York Tribune comes
a story which Mr Moojfly recently
told illustrative of -the faefci hat to the
power of single hearted perseverance
there is no known limit v
When I was in London some years
ago I saw a lady in my audience who
could not walk and had a chair on
wheels in which she -was brought into
church The look of disgust on her face
and the attention she attracted in being
brought into the meetings made me
take notice of her I spoke to her one
day and she said

paper makers of Valencia and Xativa over and you have gone back to Amer
to restore the paper to its old good ica the people will go back to their old
quality unless they wish to be found
guilty of fraud and punished according
ly About 1220 an emperor of Italy
directed that all public documents on
paper should be declared invalid All
records covering the previous two years
were ordered to be transcribed on parch-

I talked with her for some time but
she stuck to her point A day or two
afterward I told the fable of the dock
The pendulum counted how many times
it would have to tick before it was

But said one of the other parts of
the clock it is only a tick at a time
That is just what some of you are

That woman went home and bought
a clock with a pendulum and put it
where she could see it She preached so
much about a tick at a time that her
J friends called her Lady Pendulum
The day before returning to America
I received a package from her In it
was a clock and the letter with it said
Please put this clock in your room
and when you look at it remember that
Lady Pendulum is still living a tick at

A correspondent who signs himself
V C evidentlv meaning Victoria
Cross sends the following reminiscence
to the London Telegraph Your ac
count of the tailgr who has invented
gummed seams for sewed ones reminds
me of the experience of a gallant French
officer who was a friend of mints then
a young man in the Crimea General
Pelissier He was rather careless about
his dress except when in uniform and
one day he surprised all his friends by
appearing in a magnificent shepherd
tartan suit They were all envious of
his splendid turnout At night he join
ed in the conviviality which was tak
ing place in one of the huts warmed
by a cheerful blazing fire The place
got intolerably warm and when Pe
lissier rose to go the company were
amazed to find the shepherd tartan
complet fall to pieces ia an extraordi
nary manner The sleeves of the coat
dropped to the floor then the back and
the trousers also fell off in detachments
An examination showed that the seams
instead of being sewed were glued to
gether and the heat of the hut had
completely melted the composition Pe
lissier had bought them from a Greek
peddler and paid a high price for them
If that enterprising merchant had fall
en irito the generals hands within the
next few days I am afraid he would
have had short shrift UnlesB the new
system is capable of better things than
that most of us will be quite content to
former he had not been able w work I stick to the stitches
agreeably and on being invited to an
other living he accepted it and took
the young curate with him Naturally
there was a farewell sermon andwe
can imagine the feelings of ihe curate

His Modest Role
The fond mother of three children
was obliged to remonstrate with her
oldest boy because in the childrens
games he would always take the lead
and assign subordinate positions to his
little brother and sister The boy prom
ised not to be selfish in thefuture A
few days later the mother happening
to go into the nursery saw the two
younger children engaged in amateur
theatricals The elder boy stood aside
with arms folded moodily watching
them We are playing Adam and
Eve said the youngsters fThe mother
was much gratified a she supposed
that in this instance at least the boy
had allowed his brother the principal
role She turned to the silent figuije in
the corner about to praise him Who
