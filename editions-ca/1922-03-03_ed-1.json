A WARD LASCELLE PRODUCTION, WITH
THOMAS JEPPERSON
It's simply marvelous on the screen. As a novel "Rip Van Winkle ' brought jo to millions kiddie? and "grown ups"
alike from the time Washington Irving penned the immortal lines right up to our own day. In play form it has won for
itself a place unique in the annals of the American stage and has served to make "Joe" Jefferson who created the title
role famous and wealthy, And now, upon the silversheet, Thomas Jefferson gives new life to this ageless classic. More
engrossing than either book or play, it will endure for all time as one of the greatest productions the screen has ever known.
