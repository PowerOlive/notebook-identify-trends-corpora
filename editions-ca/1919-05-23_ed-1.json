The Great Nazimova
in "The Toys of Fate"
"Toys of Fate" fc Mme. Nazimova's second great Screen Classics,
production, a magnificent successor to "Revelation." In this vital, hu-'
man doucument, the celebrated Russian actress plays the part of "Azah,"
a gypsy princess, of whom fate demands that she avenge the wrong
done her mother. The cup of life is placed at Azahs lips, only to be
snatched roughly away, and life seems to play at cross-purposes with this
true-hearted little daughter of the Romany race.

among which is Miss Annette Delano,

rounds the hippodrome track under
the big arena tent performing its
splendid repertoire of unusual ac
complishments. Miss Delano Is
known as "The Australian Prima
Donna Equestrienne," and she more
than lives up to her title. The cli
max of her performance is reached
when four score of white carrier
pigeons, released from all- sides of the
great tent, circle above her head, and
tihen flutter down to perch on her
head, shoulders and arms" and on her
reins and horse's neck and back.
