become too arduous for mystrength I transmitted my resignation to thepresident to take effect on the first clay of December next and this he has accepted withkindly expressions of regard as will be seenfrom a copy of his letter which Is as followsExecutive Mansion iWashington Oct 19 1897 fHon Steven J Field Associate Justiceof the Supreme Court of the United StatesWashington D C My Dear Sir In Aprillast Chief Justice Fuller accompanied by MrJustice Brewer handed me your resignation asassociate justice of the supreme court of theUnited States to take effect December 1 1897In hereby accepting your resignation Iwish to express my deep regret that you feelcompelled by advancing years to sever youractive connection with the court of which youhave so long been a distinguished memberEntering upon your great office in May1833 you will on the first of next DeceHiberhave served upon the bench for a period of 3Jyears and seven months a term longer thanthat of any member of the court since its creation and throughout a period of special importance in the history of the country occupiedwith as grave public questions as have everconfronted that tribunal for decisionI congratulate you therefore most heartilyupon a service of such exceptional durationfidelity and distinction Nor can I overlookthe fact that you received your commissionfrom Abraham Lincoln and graciously sparedby a kind Providence have survived all themembers of the court of his appointmentUpon your retirement both the bench andthe country will sustain a great loss but thehigh character and great ability of your workwill live and long be remembered not only byyour colleagues but by your grateful fellowcountrymenWith personal esteem and sincere bestwishes for your contentment and happinessduring the period of rest which you have sowell earned I am dear sirVery truly yourWilliam McKinleyMy judicial career covers many years of service aHaving been elected a member of the supreme court of California I assumed that office October 13 1857 holding it for five yearsseven months and five days the latter part ofthe time being chief justiceOn the tenth day of March 1863 1 was commissioned by President Lincoln a justice of thesupreme court of the United States taking theoath of office on the twentieth day of the following MayWhen my resignation takes effect my periodof service on this bench will have exceededthat of any of my predecessors while my entire judicial life will have embraced more than40 years I may be pardoned for saying thatduring all this period long in comparison withthe brevity of human life though in the retrospect it has gone with the swiftness of a talethat Is told I have not shunned to declare inevery case coming before me for decision the 1conclusions which my deliberate convictionscompelled me to arrive at by the conscientiousexercise of such abilities and requirements as IpossessedIt is a pleasant thing in my memory that myappointment came from President Ljncoln ofwhose appointees I am the last survivor Upto that time there had been no representativehere of the Pacific coast A new empire hadrisen in the west whose laws were those of another country The land titles were fromSpanish and Mexican grants both of whichwere often overlaid by the claims of the firstsettlers To bring order out of this confusioncongress passed an act providing for another seat on this bench with theintention that it should be filled by some onefamiliar with these conflicting titles and withthe mining laws of the coast and as it so happened that I had framed the principal of theselaws and was moreover chief justice of California it was the wish of the senators andrepresentatives of that state as well as thosefrom Oregon that I should succeed to the new iposition At their request Mr Lincoln sentmy name to the senate and the nomination wasunanimously confirmedof its members was the venerable Chief Justice Taney and among the associate justiceswas Mr Justice Wayne who had sat withChief Justice Marshal thus constituting a linkbetween the past and future and as it werebinding into unity nearly an entire century ofthe life of this courtDuring my incumbency three chief justicesand 10 associate justice have passed awayleaving me precious rememberanccs of common labors and intimate and agreeable companionshipThe volumes of our reports show that I alonehave written 620 opinions If to these areadded 57 opinions in the circuit court and 365prepared while I was on the supreme court ofCalifornia it will be seen that I have voicedthe decision in 1042 casesThese many years have indeed been years oflabor and of toil but they have brought theirown reward and we can all join in thanksgiving to the Author of our being that we havebeen permitted to spend so much of our livesin the service of our countryWith profound respect and regard I am mydear brethrenVery sincerely and always yoursStephen J FieldFollowing is the courts replySupreme Court op the United StatesWashington Oct 13 1897 fDear Brother Field We are profoundlymoved by the letter in which you announce tous your retirement from the bench The termination of a judicial career of such length anddistinction can not fail to Inspire among allyour countrymen and indeed wherever therealm of jurisprudence extends a keen sense ofloss which to your colleagues assumes the aspect of a personal bereavementFor the intimacy necessarily incident to theconduct of work so constant so exacting andof such vital importance as ours inevitablydraws us together by tics of the closest character which can not be dissolved without emotions of deep sadness and regret We feelthat our parting involves not simply the deprivation of the assistance afforded by yourlearning your vast experience and your earnestness in advocacy or your convictions butthe severance of those relations which havecontributed so much to lighten the hardest labors of the roadThis is not the time or place to dwell on thereputation you have achieved as a jurist Thirecord is made up and may safely be commitedto the judgment of posterityBut we can not part with you as an activemember of the court without the fervent expression of the hope that you may be sparedformany years to enjoy the repose you have sothoroughly earned and the commendation bestowed on good and faithful serviceThe Conference Was a

oiarchitectsIt was not that dome said hepointing to the huge heap in the center of the floor that caused thatrouble The fault lies with the rooltrusses The house has been builtmore than 25 years and the wood hasshrunk until the bolts and naiis afforded the smallest possible security Oneof these trusses had rotted awayfrom its fastenings it has partedand thrown the two sections downand they in their descent pulled thedome with them These wood trussesare of pine and they shrink very perceptibly in the course of years Theyshould be examined overy five or sixyears Modern structures are put

and Iron Moved a Distance ofat Least 25 FeetPhiladelphia Oct 18 The feat ofreplacing an iron bridge span 242 feetlong 25 feet wide and 30 feet in depthwith one of the same dimensions ofsteel was accomplished in this city Sunday in two minutes and 32 seconds Inthis space of time nearly 1700 tons ofiron and steel were moved a distance of25 feet and there was not a slip or ahitch in the entire proceedings Thisremarkable feat of engineering was accomplished at what is known as theconnecting railroad bridge over theSchuylkiJ just above Girard avenueIt is the bridge that bears the tracks ofthe New York division of the Pennsylvania railroad the busiest division ofthe Pennsylvania systemThe time set for the replacement wasthe 48 minutes intervening betweenthe passage over the bridge of theChestnut Hill accommodation trainsleaving Broad street station at 247 pm and at 335 p mA work train crossed the eastern endof the bridge and stopped The gangsof trackmen began to unspike the railsof the westbound track on the oldspan This done the grapplers of thework train took hold of the ends ofthe rails the engine started up and theentire length of rails 242 feet wassnaked off in short orderMeanwhile four stationary enginesone at each end on a level with thebridge foundations and another at eachend on scows securely moored at thebase of the bridge piers were puffingand emphasizing their readiness forthe task they had to do There wassaid to be less than a hundred horsepower represented in these four engines yet so well was everything arranged that they moved the leviathanwithout any apparent overexertionThen the signal was given for the little stationary engines to assert themselves It seemed as if they all startedat the identical instant There was atightening of the cables an almost imperceptible creak of a wheel somewhere and the big bulk began to movenorthward It was like clockworkAs the edge- of the iron span beganto show beyond the bridge piers thecrowds on the north side of the riverset np a shout and as the breadth ofthe new steel span began to disappearbehind the piers the crowds on thesouthern coigns of vantage also joinedin the cheer and almost before thecheer had died away the mighty feathad been accomplished In just twominutes and thirty two seconds fromthe time of starting the engines thenew span occupied the exact positionfrom which the old one had been removedCHARLES A DANAThe Famous Editor of the New York SunPasses Away Surrounded by His FamilyNew York Oct 18 Charles A Danaeditor of the New York Sun died

between you and meife is as nothing To me indeed there isnothing on earth that counts nothingthat I value in the least in comparisonwith your love If I could have that therest would settle itself I would concede anything sacrifice anjthingHe stopped looking- about with astartled glance his eyes coming back toher face which wore a strangely frightened expression There was a strongsmell of burning wood about themwhile a dark cloud was streaming upagainst the blueness of the sky behindthe rocks which cut off all below fromtheir viewWhat is it she exclaimed Buteven as she spoke there was a deafeningexplosion while the sky seemed black-cned by a rushing mass riddled withmyriads of darker blotches of whichhundreds seemed to be falling all aboutthem fragments of still burning woodWild with fright Dorothy had thrownherself into the arms that were instinctively reached out to seize herWhat is it Oh what has happenedshe gasped hiding her eyes shudderingy ag ainst his shoulderIt is - nothing sweetheart you aresafe he murmured his cheek laidcaressingly against her soft hair Forthe moment it appeared to him indeedthat nothing counted against the factthat he was holding her there in hisarms unharmed against the sweettruth that she had come to that shelterof her own impulse but tlie man ofaffairs was quick to awake in him evenin all the tremulous joy of feeling thatin this unconsidered action she had virtually conceded his hearts desire ButI must leave you dearest You will notmind if I go for a moment to see what itis he urged tenderly holding her thecloser to him for the thought of presently letting her go You will waituntil I come backNo I will go with you she rejoinedher cheeks still pale with fright OhI must as his look seemed to dissuadeTierHis thoughts had flown at once to theMascot shafthouse from his memory of1 time when a similar explosion hadrent the air to leave him almost penniless Could it be that such devilishwork had been repeated She must notcome No dear one Do you not seethat whatever has happened we shou Idnot be seen coming back together hebreathlessly argued knowing that herewas something she would surely heedPlease sweetheart he

minutes frying to think what she had done what5t meant and to what end it all portended Did she love him Had she lovedhim all the while And what wouldher father say But unnerved as shewas with the dense cloud of smokestill rising and the confused sound ofcrashing timbers and hoarse cries conj tinuajlly growing louder-thought was out of the question Halfof the time for which Neil had stipulated had not passed by before she couldendure the suspense no longer and washurrying down the hill herself nowiilled with alarmed vexation that shehad been induced to delay her coming atall since it needed

not occur to her to think of theraver menace until she met HarveyNeil coming back to her and somehowcomprehended the awful tragedy in hisface She stopped as though turned-to stone staring at him with

stuff there Helingered over the broken sentenceswarding off the question he knew mustcomeAnd papa she gasped withdrawing her hands and making as thoughshe would rush on down the hill to seewithout waiting for his answerIt is hoped that they are all righthe reluctantly returned his eyes entreating her to have hope There areten men down the shaft but if theair holds good it must be all rightThere is sure to be time enough to savethemThey cannot get out Her whitelips formed the words but he guessedrather than heard themThe steam connections and hoistereverything went to pieces in the explosion he slowly explained his voiceeloquent of compassion It was impossible for anybody to escape afterthe alarm was given But as soon aswe can get the fire out Oh darlingdarling dont look at me like thatDont think of giving up until we knowThe men were working in the levelsquite away from the shaft and theinference is that your father and McCready were with ttrem There is noreason to believe that

to thinkthat at the very moment he died I wasOh go away from me I never want tosee you again never never To thinkthat I should have turned against himfor you And he the dearest and bestof fathers always so good to me sogood It makes me hate youHe looked at her with pitying tenderness as at one distraught Youdo not know what you are saying dearhe murmured soothingly And youmust not give up I would not tell youso if it were not true Your father isprobably alive and unharmed And ina little while he may be with you tolaugh at all your fright Dont give upyet sweetheartHow dare you call me that youshe bitterly retorted her eyes flashingblue fire upon him her face like stoneDo you not see that it is a judgmentupon me for caring for you for beinguntrue to him Caring for you didI say Oh

lookbidding her also pause His face waswhite and set his eyes were full ofsadness beyond words but still his tonewas very gentle as he said You nmstnot come any farther Dorothy It isnot fit for you They were now sonear the fire that burning bits of woodlittered the grass all about them whilethe smoke and heat from the well nighburnt out shafthouse made the airstiflingly oppressive Crowds of

appeared along time in the possessing impatiencethe extinguisher arrived from campand even then when the fire was conquered progress was tediously slowThe heavy blackened timbers were hotand difficult to handle while for wantof space only a few could work at clearing away the debris which choked themouth of theshaftIt was not until the middle of theafternoon that an attempt could bemade to enter the mine and then it wasHarvey Neil who came forward thefirst to go down A solemn hush fellupon the crowd as they watched himstep into the bucket while the crudehoisting apparatus hastily constructedcreakingly passed him out of sightEverybody knew that if the air belowhad turned foul as many held must bethe case another victim might be addedto swell the horror of that day andhardly a whisper broke the stillnesstmtil the signal came to bid them drawhim back Then as he reappeared awild cheer broke from lips turned paleand women sobbed for joy when he toldthat the air seemed good which promised well for the men below but he hadfound some forty feet down fallen timbers so wedged across the shaft thatthere must be more hard work beforethe full descent could be madeThe sun was setting when finally theway was clear Again Neil laid his handon the side of the bucket although nowthere were others who would havegone but there was that in his mannerwhich gave him the place

near Germany once was to losing in his youthher great unifier The same anecdotealso illustrates how duels are still madein GermanyBismarck first visited Wiesbaden twoor three years after taking his university degree He went one evening tothe big dance hall in the Kurhaus andduring a pause between dances sat ona sofa talking with a friend and looking at the persons who walked by Hehad a sharp eye and a defiant air evenin his best tempered moods and severalmen returned his looks with ill naturedstares Eventually a young doctorGustav Lange of Heidelberg walked ujto the sofa and fixing his eyes on Bismarck inquiredWhy do you stare at meNow Lange was a very handsomevoung man and Bismarck was in a happy mood These two facts distated Bismarcks answerBecause I like your appearanceBut I do not like yours was LangesreplyAn animated dialogue followed Bismarck at first seeking to appeaseLanges wrath and Lange trying hisbest to make trouble The upshot wasthat cards were exchanged in orderthat Lange might wipe out with bloodthe deadly affront of being stared atby Otto von Bismarck The seconds arranged that the meeting should takeplace in the Grand Duchy of Hesse notfar from BiebrichLange was a dead shot with the pistoland pistols were the weapons to be usedin the duel The young physician couldhit the two mark piece flipped in theair nine times out of ten It lookedbad for Bismarck Has

Bismarck had made one of hisseconds was especially eager to prevent bloodshed and he proposed toLange at the place of meeting that theprincipals talk the quarrel over beforerisking their lives for such a trivialcause Lange said eventually that hewould do his best to settle the affair Iwithout a shot if his opponent wouldmeet him half way The Englishmanhurried to Bismarck with the doctorsoffer of the olive branch but Bismarckwould not have it While the Englishman slowly paced off the distancestretching his legs to make it as longas possible the other secondwith BismarckarguedLange leaned againsta tree and said nothing Just as his seconds were expecting the principals tctake their places Bismarck yielded Tothe surprise of his seconds he did notwait for any preliminary conversationHe walked across the field stretchedout his hand and remarkedWell we will try to live in peacethenLange shook hands and the quarrolwas at an end On his way home fromthe field Lange remarked to his secondsIt is better that it ended it wouldhave been too bad to blow dayligitfjthrough himAlmost 50 vears later Lange celcbrated in Heidelberg the jubilee anniversary of his graduation After hyand his

MannvfCommunicatedJThe Mission of Democracy and the Democratic PartyCivil government was established toprotect both life and libertyDemocracy is the friend of socialorder because it seeks to cure socialevils It is the enemy of anarchy andviolence because it seeks wisely andprudently to eradicate the wrongs thatlie at the root of popular discontent Itis not hostile to wealth but it is hostileto plunder and it is jealous as it shouldbebf inordinate power and of thegrowtn of an oligarchy in a democraticrepublicThere must be such a party in thiscountry if it is to remain free Representative Democracy is the foundationof our political philosophy the voice ofthe people the divinity of popularrights and it has at all times the elements of all needed reformOur revolutionary fathers revoltedand would not submit to be governed bya monarchy and would not submit tounjust taxation even upon teaWhat is the situation tu day Wesee this country ruled by tracts for thetrusts and by the trusts and everythingwrapped up in the coils vr a trustStatistics proved that this year cattlewere several million short ami the iaruiers confidently expected from five to fiveand a half cents for their fat cattleWhat was the result It was notsupply and demand The powers metin Chicago nresided over by LordArmour and the dictum went forththat 450 should be the highest price andthe farmers were compelled to submitThey would have hammered wheat backto thirty cents per bnshel had it notbeen due to a widespread failure of thecrops abroad amounting to almost a famine in the large country of India Allthe products of the earth can be cornered under a high protective tariff anda single gold standard Restore bimetalisui and a tariff for revenue onlyand the trusts cannot liveThe single gold standard has been thedirect cause of the finaucialdistes8that has fallen upon our people since itsadoption and the highest gold standardauthorities admit that it - has been a period of almost unexampled depressionand disturbance of trade and industrywith falling prices for nearly all theproducts of human labor including landsince demonetization in 1873If the people of this country cling tothe gold standard they must accept therule of the trusts which means increasedwealth to the very wealthy and increased poverty and degradation for the toiliug massesA recent article written by Thomas GnSherman shows that 9600 persons in thiscountry are worth an aggregate of twenty four billions of dollars and that20000 own more that half the wealth ofthe whole country while 75000000 ares apposed to own the other halfWe believe in honest money the goldand the silver money of the constitutionand the coinage of both metals withoutdiscrimination against either into standard dollars of final paymeit and redemption It is the legal endowment thatgives money its value and not the commercial price of the bullionThe material in a hundred dollargreen back is worth probably the fourthof a cent and it is worth five twenty-dollargold pieces the world overWe believe in a tariff so adjusted asnot to foster monopolies and breed trustsand to favor the few at the expense of themany and that would equalize differences and the general welfare of theAmerician peopleWe would then have a government ofthe people for the people and by thepeople and not a government oftrust for the trustby the

commonly spoken of outside of the circle of experts has received considerable attention fromnaval constructors and naval engineerssince the Yaloo river fight in the ChinaJapan war and more especially at therecent international congress of navalarchitects and marine engineers atLondon and from the naval authoritiesof the United States and- Japan Thechief of tho bureau of ordnance of theUnited States navy recently made sometests of fireproof Avoodr for the purposeof reporting upon its value for use inmaking boxes for fixed ammunitionHis report declares that the Avood bybeing treated with the chemicals usedin the fireproof process lost considerable strength and was difficult to workthat it also corroded a piece of brassplaced between two pieces of it absorbed moisture toatmarked extent andrefused to receive paint This reportresulted in instructions by SecretaryLong to the board of bureau chiefs tomake a thorough investigation of theuse of fireproof Avoody and the result ispredicted that the government Avill findit advisable to cancel contracts thathave been made for fitting1 vessels underconstruction with woodlthus treatedThe board of bureau chiefs has received several reports already TheColumbian iron works at Baltimore reports that five coats of paint Avere triedon a single section of fireproof woodand it refused to receive any of themOf the superintending constructors atthe Aarious naval stations one reportdeclares that the tools employed inAvorking the wood have been badly corroded by the chemicals used in the fireproofing treatment Another makesa report upon the corrosive effect uponthe steel and iron- in the ship It is alsoreported that the AAoodl is exceedinglyporous and is apt to make the decks ofa ship spongy An article recently appeared in an English

AVort cPeond of PoundingMxich oE the trouble caused by kicking cows is caused by bad managementon the part of the milker In our experience there is not one cow in a dozenbut which if kindly treated will soondispense with the habit of kicking without severe measures being necessaryIt pays to be gentle and quiet in handling the cows and to let them know thatyou are their friend and will not harnnthem They will soon learn to respectyou if you will treat them kindly Itis all well enough for a cow to know andunderstand that the one who does thomilking is the business manager butkick for the good reason that the milking process hurts them says a writer inthe National Stockman There are alsooccasionally cows that lack from puremeanness However these make excellent beefThe gentle -Jerseys are fast taking theplace of other breeds on the farm andthe ones we have are real pets as gentle quiet apd well behaved as need beWe never have any trouble in milkingthem but often milk them for the firsttime an the yard without even fastening them though we are well awarethat the Jersey has plenty of mettleany amount of it when conditions arcfavorable for its development Let thedog chase the cows to and from the pasture and this mettle will soon be apparent as will be the decrease in theyield of miilkThere is another item in regard tobreaking cows to lead A cow that iskindly treated can usually be caught inthe pasture by placing your arm -abouther neck If caught in this way theywill seldom make any effort to getaway Place a five ring halter on thooow as this doesnot hurt like a cropearound the horns or the neck and mostcowts will lead easily with a five ringhalter A good motto for dairymen toput in their hats is this Anovmceofkindness is worth a pound of poundingHANDY BAG

receiving reports from Umatilla Flaof an almost miraculous cure that had beeneffected in the case of Fannie Adams adaughter of A J Adams of that place andlast Saturday a representative of this papermade a trip to Umatilla for the purpose ofdetermining the authenticity of the sameThe family live a short distance from thevillage where it was found that the peoplewere cognizant of the cure which had beeneffected and were rejoicing with the familyin their new found happiness The fatherA J Adams is a hard working honestfarmer from east Tennessee and the familycame to Florida four years ago in the hopethat a change of climate would be of benefitto their afflicted child Much of their earnings have gone for doctors bills whoseservices proved unavailing The representative ws greeted by Mrs Adams from whomhe gained the story of her great trialFannie the youngest child was born ineast Tennessee and was seven years old onthe third day of February 1897 When tenmonths old she was stricken with paralysiswhich affected the entire left side Thisstroke of paralysis was followed by convulsions and from the time little Fannie wasten months old until February 1897 therewas not a single day or a night that she didnot have spasms of the most distressingnature Not a single convulsion but always three or four and sometimes as highas ten in one dayThe family was all broken down withcare and Mrs Adams states that for oneyear she did not go into her kitchen to super-intend ner household work All the hngersor the right hand or the little girl are enlarged and misshapen caused by her biting them during the fearful suffering Thecase baffled the skill of the best physiciansand they were frank to say that they couldnot determine the cause or prescribe aremedy to aid the afflicted childBut what a change now in that householdfor little Fannie has recently been releasedfrom her six years of agony which brings thelight of happiness to the faces of the parentsIn January

in January thelatter part and certainly -not earlier thanthe fifteenth or twentieth and the child hadher last convulsion on February 3d nearlythree months ago Her general conditionhas improved in every way and it was nota month after the first pills -were takenwhen she began to walk without assistanceThe pills were bought at the drug storeof Dr Shelton in Umatilla In answerto the question did he to his personalknowledge know that the remedy had benefited Fannie Adams as was stated by herparents the doctor said that he wasa regular practicing physician and as such wasloth to recommend any proprietary medicine but still he was ready to do justice toall men and he did know that Dr Williams Pink Pills for Pale People had benefited Fannie Adams and also volunteeredthe information that he

The real hermits are becoming hiding place of the book but withoutmore and more rare indeed it was be- success A persistent search of thelieved that they had completely pawnshops and periodical

anything and every-a refuge for the shipwrecked for theproscriLed and perhaps also for thosewho despise the vanities of lifeAbout ten years ago a mysterious individual made his home in the grottoesof the coast of Antrim The approachof any human being seemed to inspirehim with an invincible repugnance Assoon as the cavern which he had selected for his refuge was discovered by thefishermen of the neighborhood he immediately disappeared and took up hisquarters 20 or 30 kilometers farther onin another retreat which appeared moreinaccessible For a few months hisdomicile was in an old abandoned minethe principal gallery of which advancedunder the ground to the distance ofabout five kilometers but as the inhabitants of the nearest village had longbefore carried away the beams that sustained the vault to convert them intofirewood the hermit was obliged to quitthat dangerous refuge where he wasconstantly exposed to the danger of being buried alive So he installed himselfin a grotto the access to which wasmore easily discovered but it was lessobscure less humid and less liable tocave in There he flattered himself thathe would find at least some of the conditions of existence that belonged to themen of the caverns But it was in vainthat he hoped to return to the life ofthe first ages of prehistoric humanityHe- was obliged to pay tribute to theexigencies of civilization and to manifest less repugnance for all contact withhis fellow beingsOne day he found an empty barrelthat the tempest had tossed upon thething from the feather down midgetwith cobweb gut to the lordly salmonfly absolutely irresistible to the lurking salmon deep down in the icy poolsof the CascapediaThere were flies in that book on Iwhich famous bass trout and salmonhad been hooked each fly carrying

real lifedoes not resemble his counterpart described in novels and impersonated onthe stage in the least He does notwear top boots and a slouch hat As arule he is too poor to possess the formerand he is more apt to go barefoot or toamble along in a pair of wornout brogans than to wear top boots His hat isusually a torn straw Jimmy and his-clothes are yellow and faded wii ageEegularly on days when the grand jurymeets in Louisville a dozen or more ofthe moonshiners are presented for indictment They present a woebegoneappearance as they pass along the streetsin charge of the marshal In their ownpoor homes in the mountains they arehospitable but of the stranger ever suspicious The latter may make his bedin the one room where the entire family sleeps but his request for a taste ofliquor brings forth a statement thatnone is to be had this side of theI store At the same time a still mavshore and he could not resist the temp- i be in operation within ten feet of histation of bringing it home to serve as a whereaboutsbed Some indiscreet persons takingadvantage of his absence to visit hisapartments discovered that he had apot for cooking his food Where didthat cooking utensil come from Was italso a piece of wreckage rolled up uponthe sand by the furious waves or wasit the last souvenir of civilized life carried away by the anchorite who whileendeavoring to return to the conditionsof existence that belonged to prehistorictimes could not abandon the habit ofcooking his foodThat is a question which has neverbeen answered and it is also impossible to find out where he gets thetoes upon which he lives Did they comefrom the discreet charity of the poorfishermen of the neighborhood who atthe proper time renewed his provisionsor in separating himself from the worlddid he make arrangements for the transportation of his modest provisions Thatis also a mystery which has never beenfathomed One point however is certain and that is that the hermit determined to livo upon potatoes alone Oneday a sailor offered him half of his dinner The hermit pretended to be glad toaccept the gift but he never touchedthe food In the absence of the kindhearted sailor he tossed it into the seaApparently he also vowed that he wouldnever enter a house and never touch apiece of money He kept his resolutionsThe store represents to the mountaineer all civilization On wintermornings he will tramp to it throughcold and snow to sell a few stiff rabbitsand swap yarns not overbrilliant Oneof the mountaineers chief sources ofincome is his honey and this findsready sale at the store The moonshiner seldom receives money in pay forhis wares but is paid in a bit of brightcalico for his wife or a shoulder of bacon If he can add to this a few pipefuls of tobacco he is well satisfied
