'Billy" Proved to Be the Culprit
"Billy" a pet goat of men employed
by a coal dealer whese office and yard
are opposite the Governor's mansion,
in Frankfort, has bepn convicted of
stealing all the newspapers delivered
at the mansion. The offense is of long
standing, out the culprit was not dis
covered until Friday morning when
"Billy" was found standing on the
front porch of the mansion, leisurely
chewing up the morning paper, and
enjoying it as much as if it had been
the finest quality of alfalfa or Cali
fornia oats.
Governor Willson had been missing
his papers for some time, and had
been a constant kicker with the news
dealers and local newspapers because
his papers were missing.
Carriers weie threatened with los
ing their heads and the whole affair
assumed a very disagreable and war
like condition. The carriers insisted
that they left the papers, and finally
it was decided to epmloy a detective to
find the thief, and the result was that
. the goat was caught.
