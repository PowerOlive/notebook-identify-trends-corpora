RIDDLE.

daughter of Mrs. K. R. J. Edholm,
the secretary of tfie Nebraska Asso

First of all, I am a small piece of
naner nearly . an -inch square, and I
cairy on my oack something whieh
will make me stick closer to you than
awsand burr.
My face is red and green and white,
as all things should be at Christmas-
time, and I remind you of snow and
sleighs and Christmas-trees and Santa
Glaus. I am very neat and trim, for
I am scalloped all the way round my
edge. like Christmas cookies.
I have had my picture taken, and
there are now over 100,000,000 of me
in almost every State; in fact, all over
this country iheie are people who
know me and send tor me to come
and help them make their friends
happy.
lou may burn, tear, cut me up, or
throw me away, but although I may
be destroyed my meaning never can
be lost. It is something that will last
toiever. and it is stamped right on my
lace, where you cau see it the first
thing. It has helped many, many peo-
pie, and it wilL help many more.

every place I go besides the pleasures
of tho givers when they wrap up their
Christmas packages and then put my
little face where it wall be seen, i
am usually put on the back of the
nackaire right beside the name of my
sender, but 1 am also found on the
inside, too.
I was born about the first of August,
but you don't see me until December,
when 1 make my first appearance. By
"New Year's Day I shall have spread
mv wings and flown away and you
won't seen me again till next year at
about this time. Then I shall appear
again with a smiling, cheerfpl face,
but Dust a little bit changed, for you
know that will be a year later, and
age changes one's face quite consid
erably. .
You may find me yourself at Christmas-time
that is, if you will know me
from my description, and I hope you

NO TITLE TO
MANSION
IN THE
SKIES.
More and more we are convinced
that what this country most needs is
a religion or training that will make a j
man pay his debts, snouting uoes
not settle accounts with God or man.
Often we want to bounce a. fellow
right out of church because he Avent
fishing on Sunday but never say a
word to the pious scamp who never
pays his debts, and such people are
doing the church more harm than any
lot of Sunday desecraters, for there
are more of them in the church.
Reader, are we getting close to you?
Then lay down this paper and go and
pay up and you can read on at ease.
And don't you stop paying because the
"statute of limitations" excuses the

account which you made for
bread and meat. You-must pay it in
cash or God will make you pay it
in fire 'and brimstone. God knows
no such excuse for paying as "home
stead exemption." When you raise
that excuse to keep from paying your j
debts you can stop singing, "When

At this season of the year the

erally wet and the tender grass is
much liked by the green garter snakes
found in this section of the" country.
They probably use it as a breakfast
rsalad. i
Xr. Gates, a charter member of the
Ravenswood Golf club, is an early
-morning player. Several days ago he
made a short pitch to the third green,
his ball 'stopping close to the hole.
He had visions of a par four. On ap
proaching the hole he found a snake
close to the ball. The reptile, fearing
the good doctor was about to operate
on him, started to retreat, but in" its
haste knocked the ball into the hole.
The doctor wants "to know if he
should claim a three or take it for
granted he wouldhave holed the putt
and claim a four. This question has
created quite a controversy around
the nineteenth hole and the members
are seeking an official ruling.
A look into the rule book reveals
that he should have replaced the ball
and tried, for the putt; which,, ho w
ever,he did not do. Chicago Tribune.

The potato, -the decreasing use of

was a long time finding favor in Scot

in 1743, bought seed potatoes for hi

to planting them because the tuber
is not mentioned in the Bible! At a
