But it wasn't.Then they said it would surely perishwhen Phillipine sugar was admittedfree and again when Cunan sugar wasadmittedjat a reduced importjtax.But during this . lime of "ruin,"cane sugar production in this countryincreased materially, and beet sugarproduction more than doubled.Two Sugar Trust Checks.When the bill to repeal the tax onsugar was up for discussion in theHouse, Asher C. Hinds, of Maine,arose and loudly proclaimed that acertain, ledger in the office of thesugar trust in' New York would showthat the trust had sent checks to thecampaign managers of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Mr.Hardwick of Georgia rep'ied. He saidthat what Mr. Hinds stated was true,but that the same Look also showedthat the check which had been sent tothe Democratic campaign headquartershad been returned uncashed, whereasthe one sent to. the Republicans hadbeen cashed and spent.You judge a man not by what hepromises to do, but by what - he hasdone.

Mr. Underwood replied frankly that he did' not know what wouldhappen to the sugar industry of thatstate, but hoped it would survive, asit had done on previous occasions. Headded there was one thing he didknow, howtver, and that was that thetotal production of sugar in Louisanawas less than one-tenth of the entiresugar consumption ;in the UnitedStates, and that he did not believe inthe principle of taxing" 92,000,000American citizens in order that a comparative few sugar producers mightmake an extra profit.The Price pi Sugar.The wholesale price of standardgranulated sugfcr in New "York . on theday this item is written is 5.85 perhundred pounds. One week ago todaythe price was $5.75, one month ago ttday the prices was $5". 45 arid one yearago, 4.60. These figures are takenjfrom the weekly Statistical SugarTrade Journal, the oeffiial publicationof the sugar industry of the U. S.Whether the augar trust finds itnecessary to increase prices to reimburse itself for the stolen" millions itwas forced to disgorge to the governraant, following the exposure of theunderweighing frauds, or whether theincreases are really justified by ashortage of sugar production abroad,is considered a debatable question byVnany. But the fact that the wholesale price of sugar in London averages2 cents a pound less than in New Yorkthe year around.shows beyond questionthe advantage in favor of the consumers in the country where there isneither a sugar tariff nor a sugartrust. vSTOCK, CROP AND FARM NOTESG.

The great American hen is comingin for her share of glory, says theFeather. The daily papers and. magazines have begun to note her extremevalue in this world of important eventsand saiyng all kinds of nice thingsabout her. One of the leading dailiestells us that fitteen months of herwork would pay off -the National debt,and that all the gold and silver produced in the world during the year arenot equal, in value to her eggs. If thehen would work for one year fur thechildren of the United States alone,she would more than pay the entireccst of their public school education inevery State iin the Union for twoyears. This sort of reasoning could goon indefinitely, and completely smother the hen with glory, but it showswhat a thing it is to keep pluggingaway at any proposition. A few .yearsago it was the "poor old hen," butnow all are taking their hats off toher.The Executive Committee of theBurley Tobacco Society had two sesisons Friday, and adjourned subject totbe call of Chairman Lebus.

Ke couldn'tspend any of his money, you see."Authors make less than is supposed. Clark Russell was once talking to me about authors' earnings. Hesaid that publishers exaggerated theearnings so as to get more people towrite for them."He said that the millionaire publisher, in order to draw authors on,painted the prosperity of the successful writer with the bold, crude exaggeration wherewith the preacher inthe mariners' bethel painted the horrors of the bad place.A bethel preacher, he explained,was describing the bad place to a congregation of shellbacks." 'Shipmates,' he said, 'you've seenthe molten iron come running out ofthe furnace, haven't you? It comesout white hot, sizzling and hissinglike some kind of snaky, horriblemonster.
