Jealous Lexington.
Lexington, now a little more than a
flag statiaon on th" Louisville & Nash
ville railroad, through its Commercial
Club will make an effort, to induce the
railroad company to recognize it as a
city of "remunerative and attractive
advantages" and place it on the Main
line to the South.
In a lengthy communi ':tion publish
ed in the Lexington hf. Jd Sunday,
John G. Cramer, Secii9ry of the
Commercial Club of the "nr-it city of
imagination," urges that oody to take
immediate action with tli..s object in
view and -ubmits arguments in great
profusion as to the benefits Lexington
wholesale and (retail (merchants could
reap from the surrounding territory
through which the LL. & N. line ex
tends. Through the article of Secretary
Cramer can readily be sent the spirit
of jealousy existing among Lexington
people because of the fact Paris is
now the recognized center of the divis
ion. Every promise is , given .that as
soon as the extenison of the L. & E.
is completed Paris will be made the
terminus of that line, much to the em
barrassment of Lexington who has
awakened to the realization that it
hasn't even a ghost of a show to be
come anything more than a stopping
point on this line.
In his communication Secretary Cra
mer overlooks Paris as the center of
the division and points to Lexington
as being the only logical place as a
base of operation for promoters in the
development of the State's resources,
in territory yet unopened by a railroad
In referring to a proposed line from
Lexington to Richmond some years
ago, and which was discouraged by
Lexington people and not allowed lo
go through he sayB :
"Some years ago the Kentucky Cen
tral Railroad wanted to build a line di
rect from Lexington to Richmond in
order to connect Cincinnati and Knox
ville, but our enterprising citizens of
that time discouraged the scheme and
would not allow it to be done. i, I
"The consequence was that the Ken
tucky Central was forced to build a
semi-subway from Paris through Win-j
Chester, to Richmond, which is now
the teeming main line, crowded with
trains that we want through here.
The most expert mathematican in the
world could noi now compute the Joss
that shortsightedness has coHt Lexing
ton since that time. .
"We now have an opportunity to re
cuperate that loss to some extent if we
try."
Referring to the "Lexington Termi
nal" Secretary Cramer says:
"The purchase of the. Kentucky Mid
land makes possible the hauling of
traffic between Louivsille and the Cin
cinnati and Maysville divisions of the
Kentucky Central through Paris and
Georgetown, and the "Lexington Ter
minal" is set back another notch in
the "local yard" class, and yet not
one of our citizens has a word to say,
or seemingly cares a rap.
"The Queen & Crescent has 'local
ized' Lexington and made its big ter
minals elsewhere, and still not a
croak."
The wail now goes up after it is
realized what Lexington has lost and
they want to get on the main line.
There is a great probability the L. &
N. will do as much for it has been giv
en out by ofiicials that this was the
original intention.
Fruit Prospects.
Mr. Hillenmeyer, the noted Fayetie
county nurseryman, has given out the
following concerning the fruit outlook
in Kentucky: "Fruit in Central Ken
tucky is yet uninjured, thanks to the
recent heavy sleet. The fruit buds
were developed fat a a result of the
days of rising temperature, but the
cold wave came in time to check na
ture's advance and the sleet that fol
lowed protected the buds. Central
Kentucky is about due for a good fruit
crop, and the old adage of a haevy
sleet, meanirg a full fruit crop, is
likely to be realized. The sleet told
heavily en peach trees and many a
young tree was almost barren of twigs'
when the weight of the ice lifted.
Cherriies, pluns, pears, peaches and
apples promise abundant j ields, while
the strawberry crop which last year
was ruined by a light freeze in May,
will prboably, this year, make a
record breaking yield. When the gen
erally accepted theory of setting small
fruits in the spring of the year ard
fruit and foilage trees in the fall, is
considered the surest way, yet gocd
results are obtainable in the spring of
the year in setting out fruit trees, in
the spring of the year in setting out
fruit trees, in the fall. The prunirg
season i3 now en in full olast, in face,
it is nearing its clu?e, and jet we ven
ture the assertion that many farmeis
and orchard its have neglected this im
portant work. Pruning a tree cr
raspberry bush is as necessary as suck-
eriog tobacco or thinning s hill of

Epidemic of Measles.
Paris is suffering from an epidemic
of measles and Health Officer A. H.
Keller reports about one hundred cases
now under treatment in the city.
Every effort is being made to check
the spread of the disease, that it may
not interfere with the schools. Whoop
ing cough and scarlet fever is also pre
valent, a large number of adults suff
ering with the former. About half
dozen cases of scarlet fever have de
vlope.3 but the physicians are of the
opinion that they havehe'disease well
under control. It is essential that all
cases of measles, whooping cough or
scarlet fever be reported to the Health
officer and when the case is discharged
the quarters occupied by the patient
should be thoroughly fumigated.
