with deep regret of the death of
Edward D. Shinnick, veteran editor
of the Shelbyville Record, which oc
curred at his country home, five
miles west of Shelbyville, Ky., Mon
day night at 6 o'clock, after an ill
ness of four months. Death was due
to heart troubfe, with which he had
been a sufferer for several months.
Mr. Shinnick was 65 years old,

has been a power for progress and
