UNCLE SAM'S MAPS AT A PRE
MIUM. That Uncle Sam's topographic
maps are appreciated by public-utility
-corporations is shown by the
fact that telephone companies
throughout the United States are con
stant purchasers. The companies
send frequent orders to the Geolog--
ical Survey, Department of the In
terior, for itsmaps in lots pi 250 or
500, and occasionally when some big
contract has been landed as many as
1.000 maps are ordered at a time for
the use of the engineers and line--TOen..
Some electrical-supply com-
- panies keep complete sets of the maps
r .of areas in States In which they ex
pect to do extended work, and when
they hear that contracts are to be let
for such work they refer to these
maps, and with the "lay of the land"
before them can tell at a glance the
character of the work that will be re
quired and can make their bids
.v promptly and intelligently. The tel
ephone officials who are "using the
- maps extensively" state to the Sur--vey'ttiat
they are of "indispensible
-value" in their work.

TUBERCULOSIS NOT INHERITED,
SAYS COMMISSION.
Science and a careful study of tu
berculosis have long ago exploded the
old belief that it is hereditory and
always fatal in its results. This be
lief has caused many sufferers from
the disease to have what doctors
term "phthisiphobia," or fear of con
sumption, which is a very effective
aid to fatal results. Such a condi
tion should be guarded against and
cheerfulness inspired by the assur-
ance that the disease may be sured in J
most cases 11 aiscoverea in lime ana
the simple rules of treatment ob
served. Proper, well-cooked food, rest in
open air day and night, if possible;
clean surroundings, avoidance of late
hours, dissipation and unduly ldng
hours of labor, together with the
help of an intelligent doctor, have
worked wonders in the arrest, 'cure,
and relief of consumption.
Write to Dr. W. 'L. Heizer, Secre- J
tary of the' State Board of Tubercu- i
losis Commissioners, at Frankfort, for !

WELDING STEEL AND RUBBER.
A new alloy has been perfected, by
the use of which rubber can be sol
idly welded to steel and other metal3
with a joint of immense strength.
The alloy has a stronger affinity for
rubber than rubber has for itself
that is, when a sheet of rubber is
welded between two sheets of metal
by the use of the alloy, and a strain
is applied to pull the sheets of metal
apart, the rubber will part in the
middle before it parts at either of the
joints. This newly discovered alloy
is of great value in electrical con
struction, where it is necessary to in
sulate different metals by applying
a coating of rubber that will stick
under all circumstances.
