Taking ns his subject "Education
for De-nocracy," Dr. W. A. Millie,
president of Hanover College, Han
over, Indiana, addressed the weekly
convocation of the University ot
Kentucky. He vas heard with much
interest, not only because of bis hii?h
standing in the academic world, but
also because Hanover tollejre has
just announced ttie beginning: of a
campaign for ?n 00,0 00 additional
endowment funds, in order that tl-j
institution may be able to keep un
Its standard in the face of advanc
ing costs.
At the close of the convocation,
Mr. Mills wa asked why Harover
College s asking foi a larger en
dowment. Ho showed -hp.t there is
a lack of dormitory room for tho
men who are forced to find quarters
outside the 'ampvs, that Hanover
professois are getting a lower sal
ary than is iilmost any otier insti
tution of learning in the State, that
it is impossible to raise the luitior
feeany higher for fear of closing
the doors of Hanover against thj
poorer students, and that there is a
distince shortage of equipment at
college.
