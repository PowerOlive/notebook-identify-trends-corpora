BETTIS
Anderson B. Bettis, aged eighty
five, a native of Eobertson county,
died in the Massie Hospital,
in this city, yesterday morning, of
the infirmities of age. Mr. Bettis had
been an inmate of the County In
firmary for several years, and was
brought to the Hospital a few days
ago for treatment.
Thirty years ago Mr. Bettis, while
a resident of Mt. Olivet, invested one
dollar in a ticket in the Louisiana
State Lottery, which brought him
the handsome return of $15,000. He
invested part of the proceeds in a
nice farm, on which he resided for
many years. Finally disposing of the
farm, he moved to Nicholas county,
and from there to Bourbon- Finan
cial reverses overtaking him, he was
compelled to become a charge on the
bounty of the county, and was taken
to the Infirmary, where he resided to
the time he was removed to the Hos
pital. So far as can be ascertained
he had no family and no relatives in
this vicinity.
The funeral will be held this aft
ernoon, with services conducted at
the grave in the Paris Cemetery.

he was lucky, after all.

WOLLSTEIN SEIDLING
A telegram to Mrs. Louis Woll
stein, of Paris Saturday morningv
bore tidings announcing the wedding,
in Oklahoma City, Okla., Friday, of
her daughter, Miss Hazel Wollstein,
to Mr. Oscar Seidling, of that city.
The bride left Paris a few weeks
norn for a visit at the home of her
sister, Mrs. David Bachrach, in Okla-
homa City, and to Mr. and Mrs.
George Schwartz, in Purcell, Okla
homa. Mr. Seidling was a guest at
the home of Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach,
and the result of the meeting between
the Kentucky girl and Mr. Seidling
was a genuine love-at-first-sight.
From this casual acquaintance the ro
mance proceeded to its fulfillment
when the young couple were married.
The announcement of Miss Woll
stein's marriage came as a surprise
to her mother and her brothers, Sello
and Harold Wollstein, of Paris. Her
father, Louis Wollstein, left Paris a
few days ago, en route to visit his
daughters, but stopped over at Hot
Snrinp-K. Ark., for a few days stay.
The bride is one of the loveliest;
and most charming young women o
Paris whose personal charm and gra
ciousness made her a universal fa
vorite and a host of warm friends.
Mr. Seidling is a prominent young
business man of Oklahoma City, com
ing there very recently from New
York, where he had been engaged in
business. '
