STOCK, CK0P AND FARM NOTES.
Mr. H. S. Caywood, of North Midv
dlet)wn, has been in Clark where he
has purchased several mule cults from
parties in that county at prices rang
ing from 150 to 175 per head.
John Crockett, of Sharpsburg, pur
chased last week from Bourbon far
mers 19 head of suckling mules for
which he paid an aggregate sum of
S18.860, or nearly $100 per head.
The Carlisle Advocate says : "Roy
Smith claims i.the honor on fancy
peaches for the season. He says he
weighed 24 that tipped the scales at 17
pounds. He says they were so large
that it was impossible to put them in
a pint cup."
Mr.. W. G. McClintock purchased
yesterday from Mr. W. B. Woodford
thirty-five head of export cattle which
averaged 1460 pounds and for which
he paiud 7 1-2 cents per pound. The
cattle were in prime condition for ex
port and the sum involved in the pur
chase was 3,907.50.
The entire State is threatened
with a milk famine on account ot the
shortage of dairy cows. The cause of
the shortage is that dealers and farm
ers are keeping but a few cows on
hand, because of the law requiring the
tuberculin test for all dairy cows, and
also said that the present high price
of beef makes the value of cows
greater for slaughteiing purposes than
for dairy use.
A writer in the Stanford Journal
is the first of the season to come out
with a prediction as to the turkey
crop. He says: "The turkey crop in
Central Kentucky will be unusually
light this season, and it is very easily
seen to be growing smaller each year.
Recent census reports compared with
those of former decades, showing that
uor holiday bird will soon be extinct."
The Board of Regents of the East
ern Kentucky Normal 'School has
closed a deal with Lem Whitaker by
which the institution has bought his
farm of 112 acres within three miles
of Richmond and considered one of
t he.best pieces of land in Madison
county.taB the site of a training farm
for boys in connection with their other
courses at the school. The price paid
was about $167 an acre.
A report to the United States De
partment of Commerce and Labor from
Consul Harry A. Conant, at Windsor,
Ontariio, (Contains much interesting
information regarding the culture of
tobacco in that section of Canada.
Ths growing of tobacco is fast I becom
ing an important industry, ind is rap
idly proving a formidable rival to corn,
which formerly led in Essex county.
Manyfarmers on Pelee Island planted
5 to 12 acres of tobacco last year as a
measure of self protection, and had it
notgbeen for this crop would hFve suff
ered financially owing to .the excep
tionally dry weather.
Tobacco cutting and housing is en
gaging the attention of Bourbon grow
ers and will continue to be the order of
the day for several weeks to come,
some of the late crop not being ready
to handle before the first of October.
The weather has been ideal for the
work not a rain having fallen io cause
delay and the hot sun being just what
is needed to ripen and mature the
weed. The quality of tobacco pro
duced in Bourbon this year is the finest
ever seen and the acreage will .bring
the total to the annual average of nine
million pounds. Tobacco that has
been housed is curing rapidly and the
stripping of many pearly crops will
proceed in the next two weeks.
CARLISLE COURT September
court at Carlisle was a busy one and a
very large crowd was in town. It was
thought the crowd would be f small on
account of tobacco cutting but this had
little effect. There were about 200
mule and horse colts on the market but
not many sales were reported as there
was not much demand for them,
known buyers seemed to be a little
backward. The price paid was from
$45 to $75, with some few sales reach
ing as high as $115. Charles Hamil
ton, of North Middletown, bought of
Calvin Crouch an extra fine four year
old combined horse at 200. Claude
Hamilton sold an extra fine 3 year old
harness horse to Chas Hamilton "for
$200.
The"cereal fcrops of the ' country
from present indications will reach the
unprecedented total production of 133,
016,000 tons, according to the statis
tics of the Government Agricultural
Bureau. With rceord breaking crops
of corn, spring wheat, oats. , barley,
rye and buckwheat, the year's harvest
will be 20.3 pre cent greater than the
big year ofJ910 ana 16.2 greater than
that of 1909.
Prospects for the record breaking
potato crop indicate it will be 39 per
cent more than last year, when the
crop was very short, 14 per cent more
than in 1910 and 2 per cent more than
in 1909 when the previous record pro
duction was harvested. The hav yield
is estimated'at about 31;per cent more I
than last year and 4 per cent more
than in 1910 and 1909.
August, like July was decidedly fa
vorable for crop development through
out the country, Department of Agri
culture officials declare. They figure
the composite condition uf all crops on
September 1 as being about 16.5 per
cent better than at that time a year
ago and 4.1 perjeent better than the
average condition on September 1 in
recent years.

Swale Hay Unfit re." Herscs.
Dr: Alexander, professor of veteri
nary science at the University of "Wis
consin, gives the following warning
with respect to the feeding of swale
or marsh hay:
Beware of swale bay for horse feed
ing if it is seen to contain horsetail
(Equisetum palustre). At best much,
swale or marsh hay is unfit for horse
feeding and should be used for the
packing of iron castings or crockery.
Horses have small stomachs and need
nutritious food in small quantities of
ten. Swale hay is bulky, woody, in
digestible and lacking in nutriment
When infested with horsetail it is posi
tively poisonous. Recently, in a coun
ty of Wisconsin where much swale hay
has been fed this season, many horses
have died. They" became partially
crazy, seemed to be drunk, staggered,
weakened and in some cases went
down paralyzed before death. We
found that horsetail was the cause, and
the trouble has ceased since this poi
sonous weed has been removed from
the hay or other hay feed. In other
cases of trouble, from feeding swale
hay that had not had time to sweat or
ripen in the mow or stack, animals
also became partially crazy, but they
did not die. The irritant in the hay
was successfully antidoted by giving
a tablespoonful of bicarbonate of soda
twice daily in the feed or drinking
water. Thus far, however, no anti
dote has been found for horsetail poi
soning. Schools Open With Largs Attend
ance. The Bourbon Female College opened
Tuesday with the largest attendance
in its history. The boarding depart
ment is filled to its capacity and the
local patronage is the largest it has
ever had. there being about seventy
five pupil enrolled in the primary and
intermediate departments. The music
classes are unusually full and increased
interest is shown in the department
ot exDression. Three new teachers
have been added to the faculty, Miss
RiceVThurman. of West Point, Ky.,
mathematics; Miss Frances Crouch, of
Franklin, Tenn., expression and phys
ical culture andfMiss Bertha McCorkle,
assistant in music.
The public school resumed Monday
with a total enrollment of 636, ofwhich
106 Hare3 students in the high school,
twenty-five more in that department
than any previous year. Owing to the
crowded condition in some of the
grades it mavbe necessary to add two
more teachers to the faculty.
